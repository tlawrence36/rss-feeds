      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "Some of these commuters wore classic Chanel suits \u2014 perhaps with an \u201cI (Heart) NY\u201d T-shirt \u2014 and others, tweed coats, flowing black capes or brightly patterned skirts. All were intended to show off the craftsmanship involved.",
      "\u201cThis felt like breaking the system,\u201d said Stewart, speaking after the afternoon show. \u201cI genuinely had an emotional response to the show. I felt like I just saw so many different versions of a person walking. It wasn't one woman.\"",
      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s the vortex of the city,\" Blazy said. \"It connects everything.\u201d",

      "The man was arrested inside the store minutes after the alleged theft. He appeared in the Auckland District Court on Nov. 29, where he did not enter a plea on a charge of theft.",
      "The alleged loot was a limited-edition, Faberg\u00e9 egg pendant inspired by the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy. Central to the film's plot is a jewel-smuggling operation that involves a fake Faberg\u00e9 egg.",
      "The store\u2019s website says the egg, only 50 of which have been made, is crafted from gold, painted with green enamel and encrusted with 183 diamonds and two sapphires. The pendant is 8.4 centimeters (3.3 inches) tall and is mounted on a stand.",

      "The reggaet\u00f3n-and-then-some artist was 2025\u2019s most-streamed artist globally, having earned more than 19.8 billion streams. He is followed by Swift, The Weeknd, Drake and Billie Eilish, in that order.",
      "For the last two years, Swift has commanded the top spot, globally \u2014 claiming it in 2023 and holding it for 2024 \u2014 having dethroned Bad Bunny. He held the coveted title for three years in a row beginning in 2020. Now, he's back on top.",
      "In the U.S., the most-streamed artist list looks somewhat similar: There, Swift leads, followed by Drake, Morgan Wallen and Kendrick Lamar. Bad Bunny is in the fifth spot.",
      "The most-streamed album globally was, of course, Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d followed by the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack and three releases from 2024: Billie Eilish's \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d SZA's \u201cSOS Deluxe: LANA\u201d and Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cShort n' Sweet,\u201d in that order.",

      "The Kennedy Center, known for theater and opera, becomes the sports world's focus on Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- On Friday afternoon, the Kennedy Center, best known for its theater, opera and ballet, will be the unlikely center of the sports world when the matchups for next year's World Cup are announced there. By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

In a response to Whitehouse, Grenell said he has raised $117 million this year.",
      "The notion that the Kennedy Center would end up in a spat with Congress would have been unheard of just a few years ago. The venue's history is rooted in bipartisan cooperation when Republican President Dwight Eisenhower worked with Democrats who controlled Congress at the time to pass legislation that would create a national cultural center.",
      "Since then, the facility that would become the Kennedy Center became a place where political differences were mostly put on pause. Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 ideological opposites \u2014 famously attended the opera together.",

      "The recipients are typically chosen by a bipartisan commission, though Trump said this year he was \u201cabout 98%\u201d involved in the selections. Some of the 2025 winners have a history of backing Trump, including \u201cRocky\u201d actor Sylvester Stallone, who has called Trump \u201cthe second George Washington\u201d and founding Kiss member Ace Frehley, who endorsed Trump in 2020, calling him \u201cthe strongest leader we\u2019ve got.\u201d",
      "But some Trump detractors will also be recognized, including Kiss musician Paul Stanley. And though singer Gloria Gaynor hasn't publicly criticized the president, her 1970s disco hit \u201cI Will Survive\" is both a Trump favorite and an anthem for feminists and the LGBTQ community.",
      "When Las Vegas hosted the draw, Vanessa Williams and James Brown were headliners. FIFA announced late Tuesday that supermodel and television personality Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor Danny Ramirez will be on hand on Friday along with performances by Andrea Bocelli, the Village People, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "The Kennedy Center's big weekend caps what has been a difficult year for Washington as Trump has portrayed the city as crime-ridden even as the violent crime rate is down. The president has deployed the National Guard in the city and two members were shot \u2014 one fatally \u2014 last week just a mile from the Kennedy Center.",
      "Tourism has taken a hit with travel research firm Tourism Economics predicting a 4.3% decline in international visits to Washington in 2025. That's slightly down from an earlier projection, giving local officials hope that events like the draw could leave potential tourists with a better image of the city.",
      "\u201cFor us as a destination, perhaps this gives us a chance to have some positive feedback,\u201d said Elliott Ferguson, the president and CEO of Destination DC, the city's marketing organization.",

      "Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d was crowned best feature film and the dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi won three awards Monday at the 35th annual Gotham Awards, a starry kickoff to the film industry\u2019s awards season",
      "NEW YORK -- Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d was crowned best feature film and the dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi won three awards Monday at the 35th annual Gotham Awards, a starry kickoff to the film industry\u2019s awards season.",
      "The Gothams, presented by the Gotham Film & Media Institute, aren\u2019t considered an Oscar bellwether. But the black-tie affair, held at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, is known for celebrating smaller films while also dishing out generous helpings of tribute awards to Oscar hopefuls.",
      "That made \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a studio release that cost at least $130 million to make, unlike any previous winner at the Gothams. Past winners include indies like \u201cPast Lives,\u201d \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and the surprise 2024 winner, \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember when the Gotham Awards were for low-budget movies,\u201d joked Adam Sandler, presenting a tribute to Noah Baumbach. \u201cFor \u2018The Squid and the Whale,\u2019 they paid Jeff Daniels in potato skins.\u201d",
      "But in 2023, the Gotham Awards dispensed with their $35 million budget cap for films. And this year, \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of multigenerational protest, is widely seen as the best-picture front-runner and the movie to beat at March\u2019s Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d said Anderson, accepting the award. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you very much, everybody,\u201d added Anderson. \u201cLet\u2019s go home or let\u2019s go to a bar somewhere or something.\u201d",
      "While the Gothams help the industry get into the swing of awards season, they're quirkier than bigger-name ceremonies. Small juries select nominees and winners, which often leads to unexpected results. Both of the acting winners on Monday weren\u2019t even in attendance.",
      "Best lead performance went to Sop\u00e9 D\u00ecr\u00eds\u00f9 for the British-Nigerian drama \u201cMy Father\u2019s Shadow.\u201d His award was accepted by the film\u2019s director, Akinola Davies Jr., who also won for breakthrough director. Other nominees in the category included Jessie Buckley (\u201cHamnet\u201d), Jennifer Lawrence (\u201cDie My Love\u201d) and Ethan Hawke (\u201cBlue Moon\u201d).",

      "Panahi was jailed for months shortly before making \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d and only released after going on a hunger strike. In 2010, he was barred from filmmaking or traveling out of Iran. Yet he continued to make films without the government's permission. Since 2023, and until Monday's ruling, Panahi had been permitted to leave Iran. In May, his film won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",
      "Promising though it may seem, \u201cOh. What. Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says. Sure, yes, preach Claire, even if her exclusions are suspect and her examples need further review. I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cHome Alone\u201d was at least a little bit about the mom, and that \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the vitriol. Alas, noble intentions aside, \u201cOh. What. Fun.\u201d probably wasn\u2019t what she had in mind.",
      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here). But the effect is a movie that seems almost embarrassed to commit to its own silly premise, rushing through everything instead of letting us enjoy this cast. Everyone gets assigned one tidy problem or flaw and no one has any sort of lived-in familial chemistry with one another.",
      "Channing (Jones) is the oldest and is married to Doug (Jason Schwartzman) who really wants her younger sister Taylor (Moretz) to think he\u2019s cool although Taylor, a serial monogamist who always brings a new woman home for the holidays, is just mean to him. Sessa is the youngest: Underemployed and recently dumped. There are two grandchildren too, Channing and Doug\u2019s twins, but they\u2019re nonentities.",

    "story": [
      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",

      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s rapid commercial success and audience acceptance over the past decade has reshaped the country\u2019s entertainment landscape and pushed regional cinema further onto the world stage.",

Rajamouli became an international name after \u201cRRR,\u201d or \u201cRise, Roar, Revolt,\u201d his 2022 three-hour epic set in British India. The sprawling anti-colonial tale became one of India\u2019s biggest hits, a global streaming phenomenon that won an Oscar for best original song. His two-part \u201cBaahubali\u201d series, released in 2015 and 2017, broke box-office records in India and a reedited version combining the two parts, \u201cBaahubali: The Epic,\u201d released in cinemas worldwide just last month.",

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",
      "Dubbed releases, remakes in other Indian languages and talent collaborations across other regional industries have further positioned Tollywood releases as national events, with stars often raking money from profit-sharing arrangements and brand endorsements as well.",

      "A new wave of peptides, often banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, is easily available online, raising concerns about potential Olympic doping scandals",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- The next Olympic doping scandal could be delivered right to your doorstep.",
      "A trove of so-called research chemicals known as peptides, many of them banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and some not approved for human use in the United States, are available with the simple click of a button through online retailers. One seller is Amazon. Another is Alibaba, a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid. With the Milan Cortina Games just two months away, they are hoping to break a string of scandals involving the Russians and Chinese that have disrupted the Games, both summer and winter, since 2014.",
      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",
      "\u201cThese substances have proliferated,\u201d said Oliver Catlin, president of the Anti-Doping Sciences Institute, whose late father, Don, was among the godfathers of antidoping research.",
      "Most of these peptides are so-called \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are also banned by the WADA code, either under its \u201cS2\u201d category that encompasses peptides or under its \u201cSO\u201d classification, a catch-all category for \"non-approved substances.\"",
      "The few substances specifically listed under the \u201cS0\" category \u2014 such as the popular BPC 157 \u2014 are placed there because the pharmalogical make-up of the substances don't fit neatly into another category on the banned list.",
      "One tricky part of the \u201cS0\u201d category is that it includes unapproved substances that aren't specifically listed because, for instance, there is no way to test for that drug and regulators don't want to reveal that to users.",
      "Catlin's research found hundreds of the banned or illegal peptides available on the online market and an ever-shifting menu of items, with some of them removed after The Associated Press started asking questions.",
      "\u201cIt's not like it happened overnight,\" he said. \"The mainstream use of peptides has exploded in the last five years.\u201d",
      "Dan Burke, a former FDA official who now heads intelligence and investigations at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said the new-age peptides are hard to corral online because the American law prohibiting their sale dates to 1938 \u201cand it just isn\u2019t working and doesn\u2019t work to this day.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bad guys know it, and that\u2019s why the stuff proliferates,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Though some peptides \u2014 insulin and the newly popular weight-loss dynamo GLP-1 are among the best examples \u2014 are time-tested, perfectly legal (with a prescription) and effective, other substances in the category are not legally marketable, either as supplements or prescription or over-the-counter drugs.",
      "A number of them, including BPC-157, could be found on multiple online sites, including Amazon and Alibaba. The latter is a major IOC sponsor \u201ccommitted to helping the IOC transform the Olympic Games for the digital era.\u201d",
      "Asked by AP about this connection, an IOC spokesperson said Alibaba \u201cconfirmed to us that it consistently monitors its marketplaces and that it does not have prohibited substances for sale from the WADA 2025 list.\u201d Approached by AP, a representative for Alibaba.com asked for links to \u201cproblematic\u201d drugs sold by its marketplace and, after the AP sent two of them, said they had removed those items.",

      "The West Virginia Supreme Court has paused a ruling that allowed parents to use religious beliefs to opt out of required school vaccines for their children",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The West Virginia Board of Education on Tuesday reinstated a school vaccination mandate after the state Supreme Court paused a lower court's ruling that allowed parents to cite religious beliefs to opt out of shots required for their children to attend classes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",
      "The Supreme Court halted Froble's ruling pending resolution of appeals in the case. In light of that, the board said in a statement that it \u201cis reinstating its directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance.\u201d",
      "The board further said its priority is to ensure compliance with the vaccine law \u201cand safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.\u201d",
      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. In June, the board directed public schools to ignore Morrisey's executive order. Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Legislation that would have allowed the religious exemptions was passed by the state Senate and rejected by the House of Delegates earlier this year. Froble said in his ruling that the failure of the legislation did not determine the application of the 2023 law. He rejected the defendants' argument that religious exemptions can only be created by legislative action.",

      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April.

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",
      "The studies that the FDA reviewed for approval were conducted in Asia. Repka said U.S. ophthalmologists and optometrists may want to see some additional research.",

The loss of USAID funding has disheartened many Somalis who believe they can\u2019t depend on their own government, which focuses mostly on defeating the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.",

      "But hospital administrators, civic leaders and others say the latest push to defeat al-Shabab has come at the expense of health care and other public services.",
      "Somalia's Ministry of Health was allocated $91 million of a national budget exceeding $1 billion this year, with those funds tied mostly to projects backed by outside groups. That's a significant improvement from last year's $52 million, but almost all of that increase came from donors, said Mahad Wasuge, who runs the Somali Public Agenda think tank.",
      "And as the United States has shown, donor money comes and goes.",
      "Even with major setbacks in overall foreign support this year, including from other key benefactors such as Britain, \u201csecurity remains the first priority\u201d for Somali authorities, Wasuge told the AP.",
      "Many areas outside Mogadishu don\u2019t have functioning public hospitals, he said, with people forced to trek through often insecure areas to receive care at the ones still functional.",
      "Such facilities in the capital include Banadir Hospital, built with Chinese support in 1977, and De Martino Hospital, established in 1922 by Italian colonialists.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia and the Netherlands on Tuesday agreed to repatriate two Dutch nationals convicted on drug offences in Indonesia, including one facing the death penalty and another serving a life sentence.",
      "The agreement was signed by officials in both Jakarta and Amsterdam following a request by the Dutch king and foreign ministry for the release of the men, both of whom are in poor health, according to Indonesia\u2019s senior law minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra.",
      "Mahendra, who signed the agreement at a ceremony in Jakarta, said the request was approved by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, and that he expected the men to be returned to the Netherlands on Dec. 8.",

      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",

      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",

      "Palestinians in the West Bank are living in fear of more attacks by armed Israeli settlers",
      "TURMUS AYYA, West Bank -- The fear is palpable in this Palestinian village. It\u2019s clear in how farmers gather their harvests quickly, how they scan the valley for movement, how they dare not stray past certain roads. At any time, they say, armed Israeli settlers could descend.",
      "\u201cIn a matter of minutes, they get on their phones. They gather themselves, and they surprise you,\u201d said Yasser Alkam, a Palestinian-American lawyer and farmer from the village of Turmus Ayya. \u201cThey hide between the trees. They ambush people and beat them up severely.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Alkam says Turmus Ayya has weathered near-daily attacks by settlers, especially after they set up an outpost that the anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now says is on his village\u2019s land.",
      "Alkam says he can\u2019t reach his own fields for fear of being assaulted. In a particularly gruesome attack, he watched a settler beat a Palestinian woman unconscious with a spiky club.",
      "The fear is shared throughout the West Bank. During October's olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks daily, according to the United Nations humanitarian office, the most since it began collecting data in 2006. The attacks continued in November, with the U.N. recording at least 136 more by Nov. 24.",
      "Settlers burned cars, desecrated mosques, ransacked industrial plants and destroyed cropland. Israeli authorities have done little beyond issuing occasional condemnations of the violence.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attackers as a minority that did not represent most settlers in the West Bank, where settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community. But their continued expansion of outposts \u2014 conducted in public with seemingly few legal repercussions \u2014 and the violence have cemented a fearful status quo for their Palestinian neighbors.",
      "While driving in fields east of Turmus Ayya on Oct. 19, Alkam saw Afaf Abu Alia, a grandmother from a nearby village, harvesting a grove of olive trees. They were loaned to her after the Israeli military bulldozed her own 500 trees this year, she said.",
      "She worked until she heard yelling in Hebrew. Settlers descended on the road nearby. Suddenly, one ran toward her with a club.",
      "\u201cThe monsters started beating me,\u201d she told The Associated Press three weeks after the attack. \u201cAfter that, my memories get all blurry.\u201d",
      "Video of the attack obtained by the AP shows a settler beating Alia with the jagged club, even after she was motionless. She was hospitalized for four days, requiring 20 stitches on her head, she said.",
      "Asked for comment on the attack, the military said its troops and police had \u201cdefused\u201d a confrontation in which Israeli civilians were torching vehicles and using violence.",
      "Police arrested a man named Ariel Dahari for beating Abu Alia. An Israeli court charged him later with terrorism.",
      "Dahari is being represented by Honenu, an organization that provides legal aid to settlers, who say the West Bank is part of the biblical Jewish homeland and often cast attacks as self-defense. According to an article about Dahari on the group's website, he has received at least 18 administrative orders since 2016 that included house arrest and confinement to his town in Israel.",
      "He told the Israeli news site Arutz Sheva in 2023 that he had been kicked out of the territory twice. It is not clear how he was able to return.",
      "Palestinians and human rights workers say Israeli soldiers and police routinely fail to prosecute attacks by violent settlers. Their sense of impunity has deepened under Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a settler, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who in January released settlers from administrative detention, Israel\u2019s practice of detaining individuals without charge or trial.",
      "The number of investigations opened into settler violence since 2023, Ben-Gvir's first year in office, has plummeted, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12 TV that cited official police data. Police opened only 60 investigations into settler violence in 2024, compared with 150 cases in 2023 and 235 cases in 2022, the report said.",
      "About 94% of all investigation files opened by Israeli police into settler violence from 2005 to 2024 ended without an indictment, according to Israeli rights group Yesh Din. Since 2005, just 3% of those investigations led to convictions.",
      "Dahari told Arutz Sheva that he was determined to stay in the West Bank.",

It was started by a well-known settler named Amishav Melet, said three Palestinians living in Turmus Ayya and Yair Dvir, the spokesperson for Israeli rights group B'tselem. On his personal X account, Melet posted videos of the outpost\u2019s construction.",
      "Villagers alleged that Melet travels the valley in an all-terrain vehicle, surveilling their activities. He\u2019s frequently armed, they said.",
      "Usually little more than a few sheds and a pen for livestock, such outposts can impose control on nearby land and water sources. They often turn into authorized settlements, spelling the end of Palestinian communities.",

The changes may influence the result of asylum requests of some 110,000 Syrians who were still awaiting an asylum decision at the end of September.",

      "While decisions on asylum applications are made at a national level, the agency's guidance is used to inform the 27 EU member states, as well as Norway and Switzerland. The goal is to create greater coherence between the 29 nations granting international protection.",
      "The number of Syrians requesting asylum dropped significantly from 16,000 in October 2024, before the fall of Assad, to 3,500 in September 2025. Still, Syrians had the most number of cases awaiting a decision at first instance.",
      "Syria\u2019s conflict that began in March 2011 killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country\u2019s pre-war population of 23 million. More than 5 million Syrians fled the country as refugees. While most sought refuge in neighboring countries like Turkey, many also went to Europe, contributing to the continent's refugee crisis in 2015.",

      "When he arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, Leo urged the country's political leaders to pursue the truth as a means of peace and reconciliation. In a homily Sunday after praying at the site, Leo referred explicitly to the blast and called for Lebanon to be a place of justice.",
      "An estimated 150,000 worshippers packed the Beirut waterfront for Leo's final Mass, which he celebrated immediately after praying at the nearby blast site.",
      "In his homily, Leo named the many problems the Lebanese people have faced, from economic crises to the blast and renewed fears of war. He said it\u2019s natural to feel \u201cparalyzed by powerlessness in the face of evil and oppressed by so many difficult situations.\u201d",
      "But he urged them not to be resigned, and to find ways to remain hopeful and grateful. He insisted, though, that justice was part of the equation.",
      "\u201cLet us cast off the armor of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cA Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognize each other as brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon, stand up! Be a home of justice and fraternity! Be a prophetic sign of peace for the whole of the Levant!\u201d",
      "The American pope opened his final day in Lebanon with an emotional visit to the De La Croix hospital, which specializes in care for people with psychological problems. Awaiting him were some familiar-looking faces: young boys dressed up as Swiss Guards and cardinals, and even one dressed as the pope himself in all white.",
      "The mother superior of the congregation that runs the hospital, Mother Marie Makhlouf, was overcome as she welcomed the pope, telling him that her hospital cares for the \u201cforgotten souls, burdened by their loneliness.\u201d",
      "Leo said the facility stands as a reminder to all of humanity. \u201cWe cannot forget those who are most fragile. We cannot conceive of a society that races ahead at full speed clinging to the false myths of well-being, while at the same time ignoring so many situations of poverty and vulnerability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor Lebanon, (the visit) means a lot,\" said pilgrim Maggie Claudine, who was waiting for Leo at the hospital. \"We hope that peace will prevail, and that is what we wish for. We want to live in comfort.\u201d",
      "Leo has sought to bring a message of peace to Lebanon as it copes with the economic crises, the aftermath of last year's devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel and the fallout from the port blast.",
      "Among those on hand to welcome Leo at the blast site was Lebanon Social Affairs Minister Haneen Sayed, whose mother was killed. Another was Mireille Khoury, whose 15-year-old son, Elias, was killed.",

      "As Hong Kong mourns after a high-rise fire killed at least 151 people, anger is mounting over building safety lapses and government oversight",
      "HONG KONG -- Uncomfortable questions are being raised over who is to blame for Hong Kong\u2019s deadliest blaze in decades.",
      "As the territory mourns over the high-rise apartment fire that killed at least 151 people, anger and frustration are mounting over building safety lapses, suspected construction corruption and lax government oversight.",
      "But bigger issues are at play. Some political analysts and observers say the tragedy could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d in Hong Kong, a city whose skyline is built on high-rise buildings. Suspicions of bid-rigging and use of hazardous construction materials in renovation projects across other housing estates have left many worried the disaster could be repeated.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body have arrested 14 people so far in a wide-ranging probe into a multi-million dollar renovation project at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday. Those detained include scaffolding subcontractors, directors of a construction company and a consultancy, many of them on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.",
      "\u201cThe question (one) should be asking, really is that, what happened at Wang Fuk Court, can it happen elsewhere?\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.",
      "Hong Kong officials initially said tests of green netting covering bamboo scaffolding at the housing complex in suburban Tai Po showed that it met fire safety codes, but highly flammable foam panels used to seal windows during the repairs, aided by strong winds, caused the blaze to spread swiftly between seven of the eight towers in the complex.",
      "But on Monday, Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, said that seven of 20 additional samples collected later from the site failed to meet safety standards. Authorities said there was evidence contractors cut costs by using cheaper substandard netting along with standard materials to pad their profits, after a typhoon in July damaged some of the netting originally installed.",
      "Some fire alarms failed to sound when the fire broke out, residents and officials said.",
      "\u201cIt did open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these issues which have been swept under the table,\u201d said HKU\u2019s Burns. \u201cBecause of all that we now know -- or believe we know -- about bid-rigging, collusion, corruption, no fire alarms, government negligence, all of these things have come out.\u201d",
      "As a precaution, authorities suspended work on renovations at 28 other projects managed by the same construction company. With residents of high-rises worried, contractors were removing foam boards and netting used to cover scaffolding at other projects.",
      "The netting \u201cis not a one particular estate problem. It\u2019s a much wider general problem,\u201d said Tsang of SOAS.",
      "Government oversight also has come into question. Residents of Wang Fuk Court had been voicing safety concerns to the authorities about construction materials such as netting used in the renovations, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The Labor Department said it reviewed netting's product quality certificate and found it \u201cin line\u201d with standards. It also said it had conducted 16 inspections at the complex since last year -- most recently about a week before the fire -- and had warned contractors repeatedly they had to ensure they met fire safety requirements.",

      "Responding to public pressure, the territory\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, said Tuesday that an independent committee of inquiry led by a judge will investigate the fire. He brushed aside a question from a reporter on if he should keep his job.",
      "\u201cYes, we need a reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plugged,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cwhole building renovation system\u201d will also be reformed to prevent any further such disasters.",
      "Ronny Tong, an adviser to Lee, deflected questions about possible lax enforcement. \u201cSome people have broken the law and they were deliberately trying to deceive authorities. This is not the problem of the those who enforce the laws, right?\u201d",
      "Critics say bid-rigging and other collusion, inflated costs and a lack of transparency are common in Hong Kong projects. Multi-layered subcontracting chains, which are common for big projects, raise the risks for substandard work and limited oversight, said Jason Poon, a contractor turned activist who has exposed problems at other Hong Kong construction projects.",
      "\u201cThis is just the tip of an iceberg,\u201d Poon said.",
      "Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed to Chinese control in 1997, increasingly has cracked down on dissent and criticism of the government, which is deemed politically sensitive.",
      "A sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 after a crackdown on massive pro-democracy protests already has effectively eliminated most public dissent. So, Beijing\u2019s national security arm in Hong Kong and local officials moved quickly to stifle accusations of government negligence over the deadly blaze.",
      "On Saturday, the organizer of a petition calling for officials to take responsibility for the fire was arrested by national security police, local media including the online media outlet HK01 reported.",
      "The Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong warned that the city\u2019s tough national security law would be imposed against \u201canti-China\u201d forces who use the fire to \u201cincite hatred against authorities\u201d.",
      "The disaster may overshadow an election on Dec. 7 for Hong Kong's Legislative Council if angry voters stay away, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a locally-based political scientist and a senior research fellow at Paris\u2019s Asia Centre think tank. Turnout for such votes is scrutinized by Beijing as an indicator of approval of the semi-autonomous territory's \u201cpatriots-only\u201d governance system.",
      "\u201cThe question for the Hong Kong government is: do they care about what the people think?\u201d Burns said. \u201cThey absolutely should. (And) if they ignore public opinion, I think, on this issue, this is a huge mistake.\u201d",

      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into events like weddings and birthdays, some are growing their own bouquets or picking wildflowers straight from local fields",
      "Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada \u2014 a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.",
      "Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.",
      "Because her flowers were dried, they\u2019ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms \u2014 from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.",
      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event\u2019s done.",
      "The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against nature at every turn,\u201d Chan said.",
      "He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.",
      "Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she\u2019ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.",
      "\u201cWhen I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.",
      "Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.",
      "For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.",

      "Esther Lee, editorial director at The Knot wedding planning website, said that a significant number of couples say sustainability is important to their wedding plans. She said couples hope to personalize their event and give guests a sense of the region where the event is being held.",
      "\u201cThere is just such a unique ambiance and element to the local flora of a place,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Artificial flowers are sometimes advertised as a sustainable alternative to fresh flowers, but it is important to evaluate data from manufacturers that back up this claim, said Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia Business School. Many artificial flowers are made of plastic and are imported, so \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t take the claim that they are more sustainable at face value,\u201d she said.",

      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "Stony Brook University in New York is also using artificial intelligence to review applicants' transcripts and testing AI tools for a variety of tasks, like summarizing student essays and letters of recommendation to highlight things an admissions officer should consider, said Richard Beatty, the school\u2019s senior associate provost for enrollment management.",
      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "SOFIA, Bulgaria -- SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) \u2014 Bulgaria\u2019s government said Tuesday it is withdrawing a controversial budget proposal after an evening demonstration drew tens of thousands of peaceful participants that was later marred by clashes between a much smaller group of masked men and police.",
      "Opposition and business groups have warned that plans for higher taxes, increased social security contributions and spending increases could hurt investment and expand the shadow economy as the country prepares to join the eurozone at the start of next year.",
      "The center-right government of Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov first promised to withdraw the draft for thorough revision after protests last week, but later backtracked, sparking protests in the capital, Sofia, and other major cities on Monday night. Organizers said that 50,000 people rallied in Sofia.",
      "Protesters, many of them young Bulgarians, called for the government to revise the draft budget or step down.",
      "\u201cWe will not allow ourselves to be lied to; we will not allow ourselves to be robbed,\u201d people chanted at the protest in Sofia.",
      "Banners included slogans like: \"Young Bulgaria without the Mafia.\u201d",
      "Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, an opponent of the government who hails from the political left, weighed in on the side of the protesters in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening. He said changes were needed that \u201cwill lead to the rule of law and the restoration of statehood.\"",
      "\u201cThe government is disgraced. Resignation is urgent. Early elections are the only way forward,\u201d Radev said.",
      "He urged Bulgarians \u201cnot to miss the opportunity to change Bulgaria,\" while also calling for \u201cunity, will and wisdom to preserve peace from provocations.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Zhelyazkov listed several changes that will be made, including a review of the investment program, and did not rule out the possibility of entering 2026 with an extended budget from this year.",

      "Set yourself up for success as the year winds down",
      "As 2025 winds down, here are some moves to help you finish the year strong financially. Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning, Christine Benz, discusses strategies.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Q: What are the benefits of portfolio rebalancing, and who most needs to do it?",
      "A: The main benefit of rebalancing is risk reduction. You trim securities that have performed really well, presumably ones with higher valuations today. And you redirect the money into securities where returns have lagged, but valuations might be more attractive. It\u2019s also important to rebalance on an ongoing basis as you get closer to your spending target.",
      "As retirement approaches, we need to spend that money, so you want to de-risk your portfolio and build safer asset reserves. Investors age 50 and above really need to take notice of rebalancing. It\u2019s time to take some winnings and build safer assets that you could access if you needed to spend from your portfolio. Moving money into high-quality bonds removes risk and takes advantage of current attractive yields.",
      "Q: What do you recommend for people who are still working and saving for retirement?",
      "A: They should rebalance as well, but their main consideration should be their U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure. Most investors are underallocated in international stocks. Consider your style diversification as well, paying attention to underperforming areas.",
      "Review your retirement contributions, to see if you can boost or even max out your company retirement plan for the year. People over 50 can make catch-up contributions, and there are special catch-up contributions this year for people between 60 and 63. You can contribute to IRAs and HSAs until the tax filing deadline.",
      "Q: How can people over 73 connect their RMDs with portfolio rebalancing?",
      "A: Required minimum distributions must be taken on time, but they can also help meet your rebalancing. By using appreciated securities to meet your RMD, you de-risk your portfolio, satisfy the IRS\u2019 obligations, and may free up assets to supply your cash flow needs for next year.",
      "Q: Is it also a good time to look at your insurance coverage?",
      "A: Whether you are doing open enrollment for employer-provided health care or for Medicare, it\u2019s important to shop around. Take stock of what has changed in your situation, and in the plans on offer. This is particularly important for employer-provided plans, which change frequently. Married couples often select whichever spouse\u2019s plan looks better and most affordable, but sometimes it\u2019s more cost-effective for each partner to be covered by their own company\u2019s plan.",
      "Q: How can charitable donations connect with RMDs and lessen your portfolio risk?",
      "A: Investors with highly appreciated holdings in taxable accounts should consider giving appreciated assets directly to charity or sending them to a donor-advised fund. You can disburse from the donor-advised fund to charities over multiple years. Donating removes a highly appreciated asset from your portfolio, which can lessen risk, and removes the tax liability associated with that holding. You won\u2019t owe taxes on donated funds, and you could get a tax deduction.",

If you\u2019re not yet subject to RMDs, it will at least shrink the amount of your IRA that will be subject to RMDs.",

      "City Attorney David Chiu named 10 companies in the lawsuit, including the makers of such popular foods as Oreo cookies, Sour Patch Kids, Kit Kat, Cheerios and Lunchables.

      "Ultraprocessed foods include candy, chips, processed meats, sodas, energy drinks, breakfast cereals and other foods that are designed to \u201cstimulate cravings and encourage overconsumption,\u201d Chiu's office said in the release.

      "Everything the Trump administration has done this year to strengthen and enforce the standards for truck drivers and the schools that train them after several deadly crashes may cause problems for some companies if immigrants continue to flee the profe...",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest move to enforce standards for commercial truck drivers, by flagging nearly half of the driving schools as noncompliant, doesn\u2019t figure to disrupt the industry, experts say. But the heavy scrutiny on immigrant drivers might.",
      "The bigger, more reputable schools were not included in the list and many of the schools that were appear to have already been idle, leading trucking industry officials to predict minimal turmoil. The self-certification process that has been in place since 2022 allowed questionable schools to gain recognition. Plus, these efforts to enforce training standards \u2014 and the previous moves to strengthen licensing particularly for immigrants \u2014 will take effect gradually over time as licenses come up for renewal and new drivers graduate from schools.",
      "The fact that there are probably more drivers than needed right now in the midst of a 10% drop in shipments since 2022 because of the economic uncertainty also helps, although trucking companies still struggle to find enough well-qualified drivers with clean records.",
      "Even before a truck driver that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people, the administration focused on making sure truck drivers meet English proficiency standards. The focus on immigrant drivers, who account for about 20% of all truckers, intensified after that August crash as the Transportation Department audited commercial driver's license programs and Duffy proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus.",
      "A court put the new rules on hold. But Duffy threatened to withhold millions from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after the audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired, That pressure prompted California to revoke 17,000 licenses.",
      "Trucking company owner Dave Atwal said that as a result many of his drivers at Diamond Transportation in Lodi, California, are \u201cjust afraid to go to some of these other states where they might get harassed.\u201d Atwal has been able to assign some drivers to in-state routes, but he has lost more than 40 drivers who either walked away from the job or were unable to renew their licenses even though they have several years of safe driving on their records.",
      "Dave Laut said he has had a hard time finding all the drivers he wants to have behind the wheels of his 300 or so trucks at FBT Inc. Immigrant drivers are bearing the brunt of the government enforcement, according to Laut who is Sikh like the driver in the Florida crash and the driver of another fatal crash in California this fall.",
      "\u201cA lot of (Sikhs) are quitting truck driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel people target them, and they feel insulted and they are quitting jobs. They are hardworking guys. They stand out more.\u201d",
      "Laut said his company underwent a Homeland Security audit of his drivers' immigration statuses about two weeks ago. It passed that review, which many trucking firms in California are undergoing.",
      "But Duffy's announcement Monday that as many as 7,500 trucking programs could soon be decertified will threaten the ongoing effort to attract and train new drivers \u2014 particularly if any schools doing things the right way get caught up with schools not playing by the rules.",
      "But many of the schools that would be forced out of business were already idle before the Transportation Department took action, so decertifying them may not have a dramatic impact. The vast majority of the schools at risk either failed to submit a required biannual report or hadn't submitted any certificates verifying that a student had completed their course in the past year.",
      "Logan Cooper, who arranges for trucks to deliver containers of imported goods from ports and rail yards for OEC Group, said \u201cthere\u2019s some room to absorb this in the industry\u201d but there will likely be some impact over time.",
      "But Blair Robbins, who advises companies about their transportation needs as a partner with EisnerAmper, said that even if all these efforts do lead to higher rates, they would be increasing off the current lower shipping rates that are depressed because of the decline in the number of shipments in recent years. Robbins said he has seen estimates that only about 5% to 10% of the workforce might be affected, and that will happen gradually over time.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been highlighting this for years,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many truck schools that just pop up, and they don\u2019t adhere to the rigorous standards set forth by either California or the FMCSA \u2013 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\u201d",

      "Decertifying nearly half of all trucking schools could limit the number of new drivers and create monthslong waiting lists at the remaining schools. But Rogers and major trucking groups, including the American Trucking Association and the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association, think it is a good idea to ensure schools are meeting the standards to prepare drivers to handle 80,000-pound trucks on highways across the country.",
      "\u201cDo you want more truck drivers that are dangerous, or do you want less truck drivers that are more competent?\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI would go with the latter.\u201d",
      "Antonio Yates said classes at the 100 Placement Truck Driving School he works at in Detroit are already full for the next two to three months, and he expects the wait time will get worse if all these schools close. He said the number of immigrants willing to pay $5,000 to learn how to operate a semitrailer truck or $3,000 to learn to drive a bus has increased over the past year or so.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re from all over, South America, Africa. They\u2019re from everywhere,\u201d said Yates, who added that most are paying for the training themselves.",

      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thailand on Wednesday lifted a 53-year-old ban on the afternoon retail sale of alcoholic drinks, a move expected to help boost year-end holiday tourism, as well as business at venues such as bars and convenience stores.",
      "The ban from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. will be lifted on a trial basis for 180 days, after which its effects will be evaluated.",
      "An afternoon ban on selling beer, spirits and wine was enacted in 1972, when Thailand was under military rule, though the original reasons for the measure are now obscure. Thailand is predominantly Buddhist and the religion discourages imbibing intoxicating substances, though drinking is common.",
      "Consumers are now allowed to buy such beverages from 11 a.m. until midnight, according to an amendment of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act made official on Tuesday by its publication in the Royal Gazette. While sales end at midnight, customers at nightlife venues are allowed to keep drinking until 1 a.m.",

      "NEW YORK -- The end of 2025 is almost upon us. And it's time to unpack Spotify Wrapped.",
      "On Wednesday, the music streaming giant delivered its annual recap \u2014 giving its hundreds of millions of users worldwide a look at the top songs, artists, podcasts and other audio that filled their ears over the past year (give or take a month and some change).",
      "Spotify isn't the only platform \u2014 or music streamer \u2014 to roll out a yearly glimpse of data collected from consumers' online lives. But since its launch about a decade ago, Wrapped has become one of the most anticipated. And Spotify is billing the 2025 edition to be its biggest yet, with a host of new features it hopes may address some disappointments users had last year.",
      "So, what goes into pulling together Wrapped, and what's new this year? Here's what to know.",
      "To compile Wrapped, Spotify collects listening data from Jan. 1 through around mid-November.",
      "That gives the company time to solidify finishing touches and deliver its recap to users by early December. But it also means your late November and December streaming habits won't be included, which may be why your favorite holiday songs aren't on the list, or other year-end hits.",
      "For top songs, artists and \u2014 for the first time this year \u2014 albums to show up on Spotify Wrapped, the platform looks at a mix of what you stream and how long you listen for.",
      "According to Spotify, users must listen to at least 30 tracks for over 30 seconds each to get top songs. For artists, users need to listen to at least five unique artists for over 30 seconds. And for top album, users need to have listened to at least 70% of the tracks on one album.",
      "The company confirmed that data is collected evenly across all platforms \u2014 and that streaming in \u201coffline\u201d mode will also be counted, as long as the device connects back to the internet a few weeks before Wrapped's launch. Listening using Spotify's \u201cprivate mode\u201d features, meanwhile, won't contribute to any rankings, but will still count toward total time spent on the platform. And Spotify says \u201cbackground sounds,\" like white noise, are filtered out.",
      "Marc Hazan, senior vice president of marketing and partnerships at Spotify, said his team started thinking about 2025 Wrapped the day last year's recap was launched.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a full year production that touches, without question, every function within Spotify,\u201d Hazan told The Associated Press. On day one, he noted, that includes looking at what users think of the Wrapped that just dropped.",
      "Many Spotify subscribers were quick to share disappointments about 2024's recap \u2014 with some complaining that Wrapped was too minimalist last year. Others took to social media with memes mocking features that didn't seem to hit the mark.",
      "The look and feel of Wrapped evolves each year, and Hazan notes the development of the 2025 edition was largely driven by last year's feedback.",

      "That includes returning music genres, which were missing in 2024\u2019s Wrapped. The platform is also introducing top albums and audiobooks, as well as playcounts for each song that makes your annual playlist. And the experience is more gamified this year. There's a prompt for users to guess their top song before it's revealed and a \u201clistening age\u201d \u2014 which takes a stab at guessing how old your music taste is, based on when your favorite tunes were released.",
      "Spotify has also unveiled \u201cWrapped Party,\u201d a feature that allows users to compare their listening habits with friends who also use the app \u2014 and win their own award-like titles within the group.",
      "Among other backlashes Spotify received last year was speculation over how much artificial intelligence played a role in compiling Wrapped.",
      "The most visible use of AI in Spotify's 2024 Wrapped was an accompanying podcast powered by generative AI. Spotify didn't repeat the podcast this year but is introducing another feature, Archive, which uses a large language model to break down your listening on specific days.",
      "That's the most AI-focused part of 2025's Wrapped, Hazan said. But the technology is still more broadly supplemented across Spotify's technical operations today, including in scaling the reach of its annual recap.",
      "\u201cRooted into Wrapped is human creativity,\u201d Hazan said, stressing that hundreds of people work on pulling together the recap each year. Technology like AI, he noted, helps \u201cfast track\u201d and \u201cenhance\u201d the product so it can reach the platform's more than 700 million users.",
      "Spotify is far from the only company to track what users do on its platform \u2014 and feed back some of that data, with a nostalgic twist, at the end of the year.",
      "Streaming rival Apple Music rolled out its annual \u201cReplay\u201d on Tuesday. And YouTube this week unveiled its new \u201cRecap,\u201d which similarly breaks down its listeners' music habits. Social media platforms, Google search and even dictionaries also offer their own year-end reflections.",
      "These recaps may signal more transparency for users, because they can see some data in their hands. And products like Wrapped have become particularly popular because they're personalized and now designed to share online \u2014 leaving many to look forward to it as an \u201cannual ritual\u201d of sorts, notes Yakov Bart, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.",
      "Still, one concern is the normalization of now-constant \u201ctracking of digital footprints that consumers leave online,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cWhat Spotify Wrapped is able to do is essentially package this tracked data into the form of entertainment,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt reframes all this digital tracking that's constantly happening behind the scenes into something that\u2019s fun \u2026 And so, instead of kind of feeling under surveillance, users (are) basically feeling seen.\u201d",

      "More than a decade after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 vanished, the mystery remains unsolved",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- More than a decade ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 vanished without a trace, sparking one of aviation\u2019s most baffling mysteries.",
      "Despite years of multinational searches, investigators still do not know exactly what happened to the plane or its 239 passengers and crew.",
      "On Wednesday, Malaysia\u2019s government said American marine robotics company Ocean Infinity would resume a seabed hunt for the missing plane on Dec. 30, reigniting hopes that the plane might finally be found.",
      "A massive search in the southern Indian Ocean, where the jet is believed to have gone down, turned up almost nothing. Apart from a few small fragments that washed ashore, no bodies or large wreckage have ever been recovered.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the deadly aviation tragedy.",
      "The Boeing 777 disappeared from air-traffic radar 39 minutes after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8, 2014.",
      "The pilot\u2019s last radio call to Kuala Lumpur \u2014 \u201cGood night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\u201d\u2014 was the final communication before the plane crossed into Vietnamese airspace and failed to check in with controllers there.",
      "Minutes later, the plane\u2019s transponder, which broadcasts its location, shut down. Military radar showed the jet turn back over the Andaman Sea, and satellite data suggested it continued flying for hours, possibly until fuel exhaustion, before crashing into a remote section of the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Theories about what happened range from hijacking to cabin depressurization or power failure. There was no distress call, ransom demand, evidence of technical failure or severe weather.",
      "Malaysian investigators in 2018 cleared the passengers and crew but did not rule out \u201cunlawful interference.\u201d Authorities have said someone deliberately severed communications and diverted the plane.",

      "In 2018, U.S. marine robotics company Ocean Infinity resumed the hunt under a \u201cno find, no fee\u201d agreement, focusing on areas identified through debris drift studies, but it ended without success.",
      "One reason why such an extensive search failed to turn up clues is that no one knows exactly where to look.

Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million only if wreckage is discovered.",
      "However, the search was suspended in April due to bad weather. The government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity will resume search intermittently from Dec. 30 for a total of 55 days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft.",
      "It is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane\u2019s location. It has said it would utilize new technology and has worked with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.",

      "\"Today we are sending a very strong message to the Ukrainian people. We are with them for the long haul,\" said von der Leyen while rolling out the proposal which would use Russian money as collateral to fund Ukraine\u2019s economy and war effort through a \u201creparations loan.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen said that using the frozen assets would strengthen the Ukrainian position at peace negotiations with Russia and the U.S. but it would also send a message to Moscow that \u201cthe prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them.\u201d She said that she had informed the Trump administration about the proposal.",
      "EU leaders have committed to fund Ukraine over the next two years, whatever the method. The EU has already poured in over 170 billion euros ($197 billion) since the war started in 2022.",
      "Von der Leyen said that if the loan plan didn't pass muster, the bloc could borrow the money on international markets in a scheme underpinned by its long-term budget. The problem here, though, is that it would require the approval of all 27 member countries, and Hungary has consistently blocked aid to Ukraine.",
      "The biggest pot of ready funds available is through frozen Russian assets. Most of the money is held in Belgium \u2013 around 194 billion euros as of June \u2013 and outside the EU in Japan, with around $50 billion, and the U.S., U.K. and Canada with lesser amounts. A total of 210 billion euros worth ($245 billion) are held in Europe.",
      "To address Belgian concerns, the commission's complex proposal includes safeguards to protect EU nations from \u201cpossible retaliation from Russia,\" a prohibition of any release of the frozen assets, and a way to borrow money as the EU to \"underpin a loan to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "But Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Pr\u00e9vot said that his country considers \u201cthe option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky. It has never been done before.\u201d Russia has described the scheme as \u201ctheft.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,\u201d he said, adding that the commission\u2019s proposals do not address Belgium\u2019s concerns. \u201cIt is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong will set up an independent committee headed by a judge to determine the cause of a deadly high-rise fire that shocked the city and to recommend changes to prevent a future tragedy, its leader said Tuesday.",
      "John Lee, the chief executive of the southern Chinese territory, pledged to overcome vested interests and bring about systemic change in the construction industry. Police said Tuesday afternoon that more bodies had been found, raising the death toll to at least 156 with about 30 people still missing a week after the fire.",

      "Compact SUVs have become an extremely popular choice for folks who need a vehicle that can do it all without compromising everyday usability",
      "A small SUV is a great choice if you want a vehicle that is practical, comfortable and versatile enough to handle anything from daily driving to multi-day road trips. Available all-wheel drive, good mpg and starting prices in the low $30,000s are other big draws. But what to get? Well, two of the most popular picks are the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.",
      "While the CR-V has been among Edmunds\u2019 top recommendations in recent years, Toyota has fully redesigned the RAV4 for 2026 with updates that enhance its style, technology and value. Is it enough to overtake its longstanding rival? Edmunds\u2019 experts compare the two to find out.",
      "Take a drive in the CR-V and you\u2019ll be able to tell that Honda has put in a lot of effort to get it right. The controls have a solid feel and are easy to use, and the front seats are comfortable and supportive. In back, the rear doors swing out wide to improve accessibility for passengers with limited mobility and make it easier to install or remove child safety seats.",
      "The RAV4 is also a model for thoughtful design. We are particularly impressed with its clever storage spots, such as a center console with a lid that can be flipped over and used as an impromptu lunch tray. The RAV4 also feels spacious inside, offering ample headroom and legroom for both front and rear passengers, as well as a generous cargo area that yields a flat load floor when the rear seats are folded down. But while the RAV4\u2019s new cabin is a significant step forward from its predecessor, it\u2019s still not quite as pleasant to spend time in as the CR-V\u2019s.",
      "Winner: Honda CR-V",
      "The RAV4 gets an improved touchscreen infotainment system for 2026. A 10.5-inch display is standard for most models, while upper trim levels like the Limited and XSE receive an even larger 12.9-inch display. Either way, you get a thoroughly overhauled interface that has a more intuitive layout and quicker responses to inputs. Wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard across all trim levels. The 2026 RAV4 is also the first vehicle in its class to offer an integrated dashcam recorder, and it\u2019s standard across all trim levels too.",
      "The Honda CR-V has some new tech tricks up its sleeve for 2026 as well. Every CR-V now comes with a 9-inch touchscreen that features integrated Google services, including Google Maps and the voice-activated Google Assistant. However, the 9-inch touchscreen is noticeably smaller than the standard display in the RAV4, and only the CR-V\u2019s top trim, the Sport Touring, comes with the Google features.",
      "Winner: Toyota RAV4",
      "The CR-V proves that practicality and fun don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. It feels surprisingly athletic when hustled through corners, and Honda managed to accomplish this without compromising ride quality. In general, you\u2019ll feel more confident in the CR-V should you need to take a turn quickly or make an emergency swerve on the highway.",
      "The RAV4 counters with its own advantages. It\u2019s a bit quicker than the CR-V, needing 7.5 seconds to get to 60 mph in Edmunds\u2019 testing versus the CR-V\u2019s 8 seconds. It also wins on fuel economy. All RAV4s feature a hybrid powertrain for 2026 that gets up to a Toyota-estimated 44 mpg combined. That\u2019s excellent for a small SUV.",
      "You can get a hybrid powertrain for the CR-V, but only for the more expensive trim levels. Its EPA estimate of up to 40 mpg combined isn\u2019t quite as good as the RAV4\u2019s, and Edmunds has often found that it\u2019s easier in the RAV4 to match the EPA\u2019s estimates in real-world driving. Toyota also offers a plug-in hybrid of the RAV4 to further help you save on gas, something Honda can\u2019t match.",

But remember that the RAV4 comes standard with a hybrid powertrain. Hybrid availability starts in the middle of the CR-V\u2019s trim level lineup. As such, the least expensive hybrid CR-V starts at $37,080. Fully loaded, both the CR-V and the RAV4 will cost you approximately $44,000. Otherwise, you\u2019re getting a similar level of comfort, technology and safety-related features with both SUVs.",
      "Winner: Toyota RAV4",

      "Sidney Crosby is on the verge of breaking Mario Lemieux's record for career regular-season points with the Pittsburgh Penguins",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Sidney Crosby says, no, of course he has not heard from Mario Lemieux recently as the current Penguins captain moves closer to taking another franchise record from his mentor.",
      "Crosby is seven shy of Lemieux for the most regular-season points with the Penguins. He already holds the team record for regular and postseason points combined.",
      "Heck, play Philadelphia a few more times each season, and Crosby could have shattered the record years ago.",
      "Crosby scored his 58th and 59th career goals against the Flyers on Monday night. His continued excellence in the cross-state rivalry helped lead the Penguins to a 5-1 win.",
      "Crosby, who has 18 goals this season, has dominated the Flyers like no other visiting player has done in Philadelphia\u2019s franchise history. Crosby has 59 goals and 137 points in 92 games against Philadelphia, the most in both categories any opponent has ever put up on the Flyers.",
      "The 38-year-old Crosby has 1,716 career points, close to eclipsing Lemieux\u2019s 1,723 for most in franchise history. Lemieux owned the team when Crosby captained the Penguins to championships in 2009, 2016 and 2017.",
      "Lemieux seems to be saving his well-wishes for when the record ultimately falls.",
      "\u201cI'm sure he knows me well enough to know that's not something I really want to talk about it,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cJust go out there and play. If it happens, it happens.\u201d",
      "It will happen. Soon.",
      "Crosby is in the thick of the hunt for the NHL goals lead. Colorado's Nathan McKinnon and Boston's Morgan Geekie each have 20.",
      "The Flyers promoted the game all night as a Keystone Rivalry game but the series \u2014 even as fans voraciously booed Crosby with each touch \u2014 has never been much of a rivalry. Crosby has won three Stanley Cup titles while the Flyers have won only two in franchise history, in 1974 and 1975. Crosby wasn\u2019t even born until 1987.",

      "Crosby has never played like everyone else. He did enough damage to snap the Flyers\u2019 modest three-game winning streak \u2014 and help Pittsburgh rebound after a 7-2 loss to Toronto.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a game like that, you just want to respond, regardless of who you're playing,\u201d Crosby said.",
      "Crosby scored to give the Penguins a 1-0 lead \u2014 his 60th career road game-opening goal \u2014 and added a wrist shot through traffic on the power play for a 2-1 lead in the second period.",
      "The Penguins were one of the early surprises of the NHL season until a stretch of seven losses in nine games in November. The team considered a long shot to reach the playoffs when the season began \u2014 only Chicago and San Jose faced slimmer odds of hoisting the Stanley Cup than Pittsburgh \u2014 has since tumbled from the top spot in the Metropolitan Division it held a month into the season.",
      "The perpetually rebuilding Flyers and Penguins are tied with 31 points apiece.",
      "Crosby at least gives Penguins and NHL fans a reason to watch \u2014 his No. 87 jersey was spotted around the concourse more than any Flyer \u2014 and chasing Lemieux can spice up an otherwise dead zone in the schedule. Even his teammates, who watch him practice and play on the daily, remain in awe of Crosby.",
      "\u201cIt shows you what kind of exceptional player and person that he is, to never be satisfied with anything,\u201d said Bryan Rust, who had a goal and two assists in the victory over the Flyers. \u201cEverything he\u2019s done at a team level, at an individual level, on and off the ice. It\u2019d be easy to kind of start to pull back the reins a little bit, but I think it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s almost fueling him a little bit more to get more and more.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza each have one prize in mind for their showdown this weekend in Indianapolis: a Big Ten championship.",
      "It's another one \u2014 Heisman Trophy winner \u2014 that will consume most of next week's debate.",
      "The two first-year starters at their respective schools each played their way into frontrunner status by leading their teams to unbeaten regular seasons, posting outstanding numbers and delivering when the stakes have been highest. They get final chances to pad those Heisman resumes when No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana square off in the Big Ten Championship Game.",
      "Sayin and Mendoza appear tailor-made for the moment.",
      "\u201cWith the spotlight, with the pressure of it, comes a privilege,\u201d said Mendoza, a two-year starter at California before arriving in Bloomington.",
      "Mendoza has been deferential to his teammates and coaches all season, routinely using his platform to build up those who helped him reach the precipice of becoming the first Indiana player to win college football's most prestigious award.",
      "Sayin, meanwhile, has spent most of this season trying to get acclimated to being the starter for the defending national champs and more recently with a revolving door of receivers caused by injuries. He started his career at Alabama and redshirted last season in Columbus. He would be Ohio State's first Heisman winner since Troy Smith in 2006.",
      "Mendoza and Sayin find themselves as the feature attractions in a rare, late-season head-to-head matchup between the Football Bowl Subdivision's last two unbeaten teams.",
      "The tale of the tape is every bit as close as one might expect.",
      "Sayin' staggering 78.9% completion rate leads the nation, as does his passing efficiency of 184.85. His 30 touchdown passes rank second nationally. He's 13th in passing yards with 3,065 and tied for 15th in points responsible for with 180.",
      "Mendoza leads the FBS with 32 TD passes, ranks second in passing efficiency at 183.71 and points responsible for at 228, fifth in completion percentage (72.0%) and 27th in yards passing with 2,758.",
      "Both are 12-0 overall, 9-0 in conference play and have five interceptions. The biggest difference statistically \u2014 Mendoza averages 13.07 yards per throw, No. 24 nationally, while Sayin ranks 62nd.",

      "And while Sayin's signature moment came last week when he snapped a four-game losing streak to the dreaded Wolverines, Mendoza delivered two of this season's biggest plays \u2014 beating an Iowa blitz with a tiebreaking, 49-yard TD pass to Elijah Sarratt with 1;28 left in a 20-15 victory and the incredible 7-yard TD pass to Omar Cooper Jr. in the final minute to beat Penn State 27-24.",
      "After throwing a tying Pick-6 late at then-No. 3 Oregon, Mendoza responded by taking Hoosiers on a 75-yard scoring march and throwing the go-ahead TD pass to Sarratt for a 30-20 victory that cemented Indiana's spot in the national championship conversation.",
      "\u201cThe Oregon game, I think, gave us a lot of credibility,\u201d second-year Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti said. \u201cThat was a step we had to take as a program \u2014 go on the road, play a top five team and come back with a win. Oregon's a great team and Dan Lanning is a great football coach and so, I think, from that point on, there has been a little bit more acceptance of where we're at as a program.\u201d",
      "Mendoza has a chance to put an exclamation on Indiana's second straight record-breaking season \u2014 if Indiana beats the Buckeyes for the first time since 1988, claims its first conference crown since 1967 and reaches to No. 1 in The Associated Press poll for the first time in school history.",
      "Sayin is trying to extend the nation's longest active winning streak to 17 games, capture Ohio State's first conference crown since 2020 and help the Buckeyes become back-to-back national champions for the first time in school history.",
      "Cignetti knows just how challenging it will be to derail those plans.",
      "\u201cJulian Sayin is a tremendous football player. He\u2019s young but doesn\u2019t play like he\u2019s young,\u201d he said. \u201cSuper quick release, very accurate and he\u2019s mobile. They've got great weapons on the outside.\"",
      "But as coaches and players stay focused on Saturday's contest, the quarterbacks are downplaying the game inside the game \u2014 whether the winner has the inside track to winning the Heisman.",
      "\u201cA lot of quarterbacks have struggled with (Ohio State's defense) throughout the entire season, and there's a reason for that,\" Mendoza said. \u201cI think it's a great opportunity and a great challenge for the Indiana offense to play the Indiana brand of ball we want to play against such a great defense.\u201d",

His first big hit was an AI-generated song called \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d that made fun of rapper Drake during the height of his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He's since moved into making AI video parodies like \u201cI\u2019m McLovin It (Popeye\u2019s Diss Song)\u201d and \u201cI Want My Barrel Back (Cracker Barrel song).\u201d",

      "He starts with writing his own notes on an idea, then refines it with a chatbot, and puts that language \u2014 known as a prompt \u2014 into AI tools that can generate imagery, video, music and voices. The key, he says, is to keep iterating.",

And once the writers' strike happened, that kind of shut that down. I started to learn these AI tools and get really good at them and started to cultivate an audience.\u201d",

Lajoie ended up bowing out, after an interview with The Associated Press in which he voiced doubts about what he described as AI's \u201cNapster phase.\u201d The music-sharing website shuttered in the early 2000s after the record industry and rock band Metallica sued over copyright violations.",
      "The investment firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been bullish about AI's potential to bring new life into filmmaking and comedy. On a November podcast, he blamed Hollywood opposition to its adoption on \u201cwoke activists (who) have picked up AI as the new thing they\u2019re going to agitate about.\u201d He compared it to resistance to computer graphics in movies before they became commonplace.",
      "Lajoie said he shared his early AI video experiments with a few friends who are \u201canti-AI; real, real, anti-AI\u201d and they were surprised by how well the sketches retained Lajoie's own comedic voice.",
      "He insists he's no AI expert, just \u201ca creative person who can figure out how to make two characters talk to each other.\u201d But even editing the sketches requires understanding comedic timing, and he has no interest in ceding that part to a machine.",
      "\u201cThe thing with comedy is it\u2019s so related to performance, delivery and point of view,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cDo AIs have a point of view? They can grab a few points of view from different people.\u201d",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "A species can be banned for trade in its home range but sold online by traders who abuse the CITES permitting process and captive breeding rules and then take advantage of importing countries that don't bother to check if the animals come from the wild, Collis said.",
      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.",
      "The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.",
      "The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.",
      "Max Kotz, one of the study\u2019s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.",
      "Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn't involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute's work remains the same \u201cno matter which part of the range the true figure will be.\u201d",

      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",

      "Amid growing criticism, India\u2019s telecom minister, Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, on Tuesday called the app a \u201cvoluntary and democratic system\" and said users can choose to activate it and \u201ceasily delete it from their phone at any time.\u201d",
      "Scindia did not clarify Monday\u2019s directive instructing smartphone manufacturers to ensure the app\u2019s \u201cfunctionalities are not disabled or restricted.\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",

      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",

All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",

      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "The AI tool can scan about 250,000 essays in under an hour, compared with a human reader who averages two minutes per essay. Based on last year\u2019s application pool, \u201cWe\u2019re saving at least 8,000 hours,\u201d Espinoza said.",
      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts. Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",
      "Stony Brook University in New York is also using artificial intelligence to review applicants' transcripts and testing AI tools for a variety of tasks, like summarizing student essays and letters of recommendation to highlight things an admissions officer should consider, said Richard Beatty, the school\u2019s senior associate provost for enrollment management.",
      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending.",
      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",
      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",

      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",

While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",

Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

    "summary": "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

It's also the only hospital in the area equipped to handle the most serious cases.",

    "story": [
      "Reports emerged later that two survivors were killed after the initial strike.",
      "When President Donald Trump and Defense officials revealed on Sept. 2 that the U.S. military killed 11 alleged drug smugglers on a boat in the Caribbean Sea, they touted it as a success in their war against South American cartels.",
      "Their initial comments were met with scrutiny due to the lack of details they provided. More questions arose months later after it was reported that survivors from the attack were killed in a subsequent strike. The White House later confirmed on Monday that there was more than one strike on the boat.",
      "Trump first announced the strike on his social media site as a \"kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.\"",
      "The post included a video of the strike that showed only one hit.",
      "Trump alleged that the boat was under the control of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro denied the allegations and criticized the U.S. for the attack.",
      "Trump said a day later that a \"massive\" amount of drugs was on the boat, but provided little detail.",
      "\"It was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people. And, everybody fully understands that fact. You see it, you see the bags of drugs all over the boat, and they were hit,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sept. 3. \"When they watch that tape, they're going to say, 'Let's not do this.'\"",
      "That same day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also touted the strike during a \"Fox & Friends\" interview and refuted a Maduro spokesperson's suggestion that the video was AI-generated.",
      "\"That was definitely not artificial intelligence. I watched it live,\" he said. \"We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented.\"",
      "The administration would go on to report 20 more strikes against boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 83 people.",
      "Hegseth spoke about the U.S. operation on Oct. 23 at a White House event on fighting drug cartels, arguing that suspects on the boats would be treated \"like foreign terrorist organizations on the offense.\"",
      "\"So the Department of War is not going to degrade, or just simply arrest. We're going to defeat and destroy these terrorist organizations to defend the homeland on behalf of the American people,\" he said.",
      "His remarks came a week after survivors were reported following a strike on a boat in the Caribbean. The survivors eventually were released to their home countries of Colombia and Ecuador, which prevented them from protesting their detention in a U.S. court.",
      "When asked by ABC News' Mary Bruce about how survivors would be treated in the future, Hegseth responded, \"We've got protocol of how we'll handle it,\" but did not go into detail.",
      "At the same event, Trump told reporters that he didn't plan to ask Congress for authority or declare war against the cartels, and instead he declared bluntly, \"We're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country.\"",
      "However, new questions arose about the legality of the attacks after a Nov. 28 Washington Post report that said the first strike on Sept. 2 initially left two survivors clinging to the wreckage and that before the strike Hegseth had given spoken orders to kill everyone on board.",

      "During the plea hearing of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, son of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, in Chicago, U.S. prosecutors revealed details of the abduction of Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of kilograms (pounds) of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state\u2019s capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \u201cChapitos,\u201d as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons were known. Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",

      "Rather than congratulating or thanking the U.S. for arresting the elusive Zambada, Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office said it was studying the possibility of bringing treason charges against Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez or whoever else aided in the plot.",

      "Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell pledged a historic $6.25 billion on Tuesday to provide an incentive to families to adopt new investment accounts for children",
      "NEW YORK -- Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion Tuesday to provide 25 million American children under 10 an incentive to claim the new investment accounts for children created as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation.",
      "The historic gift has little precedent, with few single charitable commitments in the past 25 years exceeding $1 billion, much less multiple billions. Announced on GivingTuesday, the Dells believe it\u2019s the largest single private commitment made to U.S. children.",
      "Its structure is also unusual. Essentially, it builds on the \u201c Trump Accounts \" program, where the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts set up by Treasury for American children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028. The Dells' gift will use the \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d infrastructure to give $250 to each qualified child under 10.",
      "\u201cWe believe that if every child can see a future worth saving for, this program will build something far greater than an account. It will build hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,\u201d said Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies whose estimated net worth is $148 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "Though the \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d became law as part of the president's signature legislation in July, the Dells say the accounts will not launch until July 4, 2026. Michael Dell said they wanted to mark the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence.",
      "\u201cWe want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,\u201d said Susan Dell. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all rooting for them to have a wonderful future, a bright future, and that that\u2019s available to them.\u201d",
      "Under the new law, \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d are available to any American child under 18 with a Social Security number and their families can fund the accounts, which must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.",
      "The Dells will put money into the accounts of children 10 and younger who live in ZIP codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less and who won't get the $1,000 seed money from the Treasury. The Dells hope their gift will encourage families to claim the accounts and deposit more money into it, even small amounts, so it will grow over time along with the stock market.",
      "President Trump plans to celebrate the commitment later on Tuesday and a White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Dell's gift will be the first of many new pledges to fund the accounts.",
      "\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s Trump Accounts are a revolutionary investment by the federal government into the next generation of American children,\u201d Desai said. \u201cIt\u2019s also President Trump\u2019s call to action for American businesses and philanthropists to do their part, too.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country\u2019s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,\" Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who advocated for the passage of this legislation. \"And so, this is a unique platform that\u2019s being created by the government that I think can unlock major giving.\u201d",
      "Gerstner is also the founder of Invest America Charitable Foundation, which is supporting the Treasury in launching the accounts. He said the goal of the accounts is to give young people funds to jump start their lives but also to help them benefit from the growth of the U.S. economy through investing in stocks.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, we need to include everybody in the upside of the American experiment. Otherwise, it won\u2019t last. And so, at its core, we think it can re-energize people\u2019s belief in free market, capitalist democracy,\u201d\u2033 Gerstner said of the accounts.",

      "In 2024, about 13% of children and young people in the U.S. lived in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and experts link the high child poverty rates to the lack of social supports for new parents, like paid parental leave.",

Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and child care that were also included in the spending package are likely to reduce the support children from low-income families receive.",

      "Pope Leo XIV offered a silent prayer at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion as he wraps up his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon on Tuesday.",
      "He also met with relatives of some of the 218 victims of the blast on Aug. 4, 2020. The explosion tore through Beirut and did billions of dollars in damage after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse.",
      "No official has been convicted in a judicial investigation that has been repeatedly obstructed, angering Lebanese for whom the blast was just the latest crisis after decades of corruption and financial crimes. When he arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, Leo urged the country\u2019s political leaders to pursue the truth as a means of peace and reconciliation in the country.",
      "Leo sought to bring a message of peace to Lebanon as it copes with years of economic and political crises.",
      "The American pope opened his final day with a visit to the De La Croix hospital, which specializes in care for people with psychological problems, and will close with a Mass along the Beirut waterfront before returning to Rome.",
      "On Monday, he presided over a gathering of Lebanon\u2019s Christian and Muslim spiritual leaders, celebrating the country\u2019s interfaith coexistence as a potent message of peace in the conflict-plagued region.",
      "Here is the latest:",
      "In his farewell speech at the Beirut airport at the conclusion of the first foreign trip of his pontificate Tuesday, Pope Leo XIV referenced the ongoing conflict in southern Lebanon, including \u201cBiblical places,\u201d and sent a message of support to people of the south.",
      "Christians in the south had been disappointed his visit did not include their areas, which were battered by last year\u2019s war between Israel and Hezbollah and are still the target of regular Israeli airstrikes.",
      "\u201cI greet all the regions of Lebanon that I was unable to visit: Tripoli and the north, the Beqaa and the south of the country, which is currently experiencing a state of conflict and uncertainty,\u201d Leo said, referencing the cities of Sidon and Tyre, which are mentioned in the New Testament, as \u201cbiblical places.\u201d",
      "\u201cMay the attacks and hostilities cease,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must recognize that armed struggle brings no benefit. While weapons are lethal, negotiation, mediation and dialogue are constructive.\u201d",
      "Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the pope to keep Lebanon in his prayers.",
      "The Lebanese are \u201ca faithful people who deserve life \u2014 who are worthy of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we bid you farewell, we do not only part with an honored guest, but with a father who brought us comfort, and reminded us that the world has not forgotten Lebanon.\u201d",
      "Concluding a public Mass on Beirut\u2019s waterfront, Pope Leo XIV made another call for peace.",
      "\u201cThe Middle East needs new approaches in order to reject the mindset of revenge and violence, to overcome political, social and religious divisions, and to open new chapters in the name of reconciliation and peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe path of mutual hostility and destruction in the horror of war has been traveled too long with the deplorable results that are before everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d",
      "He urged Christians in the region to have courage and faith.",
      "\u201cDear Christians of the Levant, when the results of your efforts for peace are slow in coming, I invite you to lift your gaze to the Lord who is coming,\u201d Leo said.",
      "The Mass drew an estimated 150,000 people, capping off Leo\u2019s three-day visit to Lebanon before a return flight to Rome from the Beirut airport.",
      "Pope Leo XIV has called for Lebanon to be a \u201chome of justice and fraternity\u201d and a \u201cprophetic sign of peace\u201d in the region.",
      "Leo made the appeal during Mass along the Beirut waterfront on the final day of his visit.",
      "In his homily, Leo acknowledged the many crises that have scarred Lebanon, citing the 2020 Beirut port blast, economic crises and \u201cthe violence and conflicts that have reawakened ancient fears.\u201d",
      "He said it is natural to feel \u201cparalyzed by powerlessness in the face of evil and oppressed by so many difficult situations.\u201d",
      "But the pope urged Lebanon\u2019s people to not be resigned and to find ways to remain hopeful and grateful. He insisted, though, that justice was part of the equation.",
      "\u201cLet us cast off the armor of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cA Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognize each other as brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon, stand up,\u201d he said. \u201cBe a home of justice and fraternity! Be a prophetic sign of peace for the whole of the Levant!\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of worshippers packed into an open area on the Beirut waterfront where Pope Leo XIV is set to deliver a public mass before heading back to Rome.",
      "The crowd included Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun and other government leaders, as well as people from all walks of life.",
      "\u201cI think the pope\u2019s visit will give the Lebanese people hope, hope that there will be peace, because we have been waiting for peace for 50 years,\" said Gabriel Raji, who was among the attendees.",
      "Lebanon fought a brutal 15-year civil war that began 50 years ago in 1975. Since then, it has faced several other conflicts including wars between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The most recent nominally ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November 2024. Since then, Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.",

      "The board of the South Florida college that's giving away a valuable piece of property for Donald Trump's future presidential library revoted to transfer the land on Tuesday.",
      "The board of Miami Dade College faces a lawsuit filed by a local activist and a trial set for August over allegations it violated the state's open government law when it first voted to gift the parcel. The lawsuit said the board failed to provide sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property in downtown Miami. A judge has temporarily blocked the college from formally transferring the land, while the lawsuit plays out.",

      "On Tuesday, the board held a new meeting at its campus in Hialeah, a predominantly Cuban American and Republican-leaning suburb of Miami. Dozens of students, professors, alumni and local officials packed the meeting to weigh in on the land transfer, an opportunity some felt they were denied when the board initially voted on the matter.",
      "An agenda released ahead of the September meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike the majority of the board's other meetings, neither the September vote nor Tuesday's redo were livestreamed.",

      "A shooting last weekend at a children\u2019s birthday party in California that left four dead was the 17th mass killing this year \u2014 the lowest number recorded since 2006, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.",
      "Experts warn that the drop doesn't necessarily mean safer days are here to stay and that it could simply represent a return to average levels.",
      "\u201cSir Isaac Newton never studied crime, but he says \u2018What goes up must come down,'\" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. The current drop in numbers is more likely what statisticians call a \u201cregression to the mean,\u201d he said, representing a return to more average crime levels after an unusual spike in mass killings in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\u201cWill 2026 see a decline?\" Fox said. \"I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. What goes down must also go back up.\u201d",
      "The mass killings \u2014 defined as incidents in which four or more people are killed in a 24-hour period, not including the killer \u2014 are tracked in the database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. Fox, who manages the database, says mass killings were down about 24% this year compared to 2024, which was also about a 20% drop compared to 2023.",
      "Mass killings are rare, and that means the numbers are volatile, said James Densley, a professor of at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota.",
      "\u201cBecause there's only a few dozen mass killings in a year, a small change could look like a wave or a collapse,\u201d when really it's just a return to more typical levels, Densley said. \u201c2025 looks really good in historical context, but we can't pretend like that means the problem is gone for good.\u201d",
      "But there are some things that might be contributing to the drop, Densley said, including an overall decline in homicide and violent crime rates, which peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in the immediate response to mass shootings and other mass casualty incidents could also be playing a part, he said.",
      "\u201cWe had the horrible Annunciation School shooting here in Minnesota back in August, and that case wouldn't even fit the mass killing definition because there were only two people killed but over 20 injured,\u201d Densley said. \u201cBut I happen to know from the response on the ground here, that the reason only two people were killed is because of the bleeding control and trauma response by the first responders. And it happened on the doorsteps of some of the best children's hospitals in the country.\u201d",
      "Crime is complex, and academics are not great at assessing the reasons behind crime rate changes, said Eric Madfis, a professor of criminal justice at University of Washington-Tacoma.",
      "\u201cIt's multicausal. It's never going to be just one thing. People are still debating why homicide rates went down in the 1990s,\u201d Madfis said. \u201cIt is true that gun violence and gun violence deaths are down, but we still have exceedingly high rates and numbers of mass shootings compared to anywhere else in the world.\"",

Some states used the money to create social supports for people at risk of committing violence, and others used it for things like law enforcement and threat assessment programs. That flexibility has been key to reducing gun violence rates, he said.",

      "The Trump administration is pausing immigration applications, including green cards, for people from 19 countries previously banned from travel",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is pausing all immigration applications such as requests for green cards for people from 19 countries banned from travel earlier this year, as part of sweeping immigration changes in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard troops.",
      "The changes were outlined in a policy memo posted Tuesday on the website of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency tasked with processing and approving all requests for immigration benefits.",
      "The pause puts on hold a wide range of immigration-related decisions such as green card applications or naturalizations for immigrants from those 19 countries that the Trump administration has described as high-risk. It's up to the agency's director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said.",
      "The administration in June banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns.",
      "The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U.S. before the travel ban went into effect.",
      "But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U.S. \u2014 regardless of when they arrived \u2014 will come under extra scrutiny.",
      "The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all \u201capproved benefit requests\u201d for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration.",
      "The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House.",

      "In 1981, President Ronald Reagan authorized the CIA to support the anti-communist right-wing guerrilla force known as the Contras who were working against the Sandinistas in the Nicaraguan government. Congress cut off all military assistance to the Contras in 1984.",
      "Months before the cutoff, top officials in Reagan's administration ramped up a secret White House-directed supply network to the Contras. The operation\u2019s day-to-day activities were handled by National Security Council aide Oliver North. The goal was to keep the Contras operating until Congress could be persuaded to resume CIA funding.",
      "The secrecy of North\u2019s network unraveled after one of its planes with Hasenfus on board was shot down over Nicaragua in October 1986. Three other crew members died, but Hasenfus parachuted into the jungle and evaded authorities for more than 24 hours.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

      "The money will be given to most children ages 10 and younger who were born before the qualifying date of the Trump accounts, which were created earlier this year through the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Those accounts are designed to provide $1,000 to babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",

      "Dell, who is ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the world's 11th richest person with net worth of $148 billion, said he and his wife were inspired by the Invest America program, which is the formal name of the Trump accounts. The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",

      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",

      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "If you're saving for college, a 529 savings plan could be a better alternative, investment experts said. It lets families sock away money tax-free for education expenses. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering accountholders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",

    "summary": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is seeking to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",
      "No member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the current law and no public records exist indicating that any officials have ever paid fines for disclosure errors, according to James R. Copland, a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank.",
      "Luna called\u00a0last month's hearing \"for show,\" and expressed concern that watered-down legislation \"with no teeth\" could end up on the floor instead of the compromise bill.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",

      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trail Head Coffee, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

    "summary": "A long-lost painting by 17th-century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens sold at auction for well beyond its asking price.",
    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",
      "Also in November, a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo\u00a0sold for $54.66 million\u00a0in New York, a record for a painting by a woman. Two nights before that, a Gustav Klimt canvas\u00a0fetched $236.4 million\u00a0\u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

      "\"All impacted U.S. carriers have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work,\" Duffy said.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people were injured and taken to area hospitals upon\u00a0landing, according to Vivian Shedd, a spokesperson for Tampa Fire Rescue.",
      "Airbus identified an apparent issue relating to \"intense solar radiation,\" which \"may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and recommended an emergency software update to the A320 family of aircraft \u2013 a common passenger plane for U.S. carriers.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued emergency orders Friday that grounded the affected planes. The EU safety agency's order took effect Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, meaning planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "The software change comes as U.S. passengers were beginning to head home from the Thanksgiving holiday, which is the busiest travel time in the country. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft will be impacted, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet. Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",
      "\"All aircraft will be completed ahead of the EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive taking effect tomorrow at 6 p.m. CT,\" American said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii Airlines said it was unaffected.",
      "Internationally, Japan's All Nippon Airways canceled 65 domestic flights on Saturday and said further cancellations were possible. Air India said on X that it had completed the reset on more than 40% of the planes that needed it, and that there were no cancellations so far. France's transport minister said the issue had a limited impact in the country. Disruptions were also minimal in the U.K., Germany and Scandinavia.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday. The FAA says it expects this year's Thanksgiving holiday travel period to be the busiest in 15 years.",
      "Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologized to customers in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "\"Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations, with the safety assurance you expect from Airbus,\" he wrote in a message posted on Saturday.",

    "summary": "Shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday despite wider economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. It was a slight increase from the company's spending estimate of $11.7 billion.",
      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan Retailers Association encourages local shopping on Cyber Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopify outage disrupts some merchants on Cyber Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter storm remains a problem on busiest holiday travel day at airports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaryland travelers battle the crowds to return from holiday destinations",

    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hegseth-venezuela-boat-strikes-war-crimes-are-they-legal/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved at least two strikes, according to a Washington Post report. It said that after a first strike left two survivors, a subsequent strike killed them. A U.S. official confirms a total of four missiles were used.",
      "The Post also reported that Hegseth gave a verbal order to \"kill everybody\" in the Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea, though Hegseth has not confirmed this. He told reporters Tuesday that he did not see survivors in the live video he viewed and was not in the room when Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander overseeing the operation, ordered a second strike. Bradley, according to the report, was complying with Hegseth's directive as two survivors clung to the wreckage.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday first confirmed a second strike on the boat was directed by Bradley, who, she said, \"worked well within his authority and the law \u2026 to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat of narco-terrorists to the United States was completely eliminated.\" Hegseth authorized Bradley to conduct the strikes, Leavitt said, though she denied that the defense secretary had given the order to kill them all.",
      "President Trump said Sunday he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike and added that Hegseth had told him \"he did not order the death of those two men.\" Mr. Trump made similar comments on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not have all the information about the second strike.",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "Analysis from The Free Press: Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The Post's report has further fueled debate about whether the U.S. is committing war crimes.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in a letter last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the alleged intentional killing of defenseless survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "Still, a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, the Post reported.",
      "Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that allegedly killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Wednesday that he is pardoning Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was indicted last year on more than a dozen federal charges\u00a0related to bribery allegations.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the pardon for Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, on Truth Social, claiming their prosecution was the result of weaponization by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight \u2014 Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president wrote, alleging that Cuellar's opposition to Biden's immigration policies was the reason he was indicted.",
      "The president wrote that the Texas Democrat \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders and the Biden Border 'Catastrophe'\" and accused Biden of deliberately targeting the congressman and his wife \"simply for speaking the TRUTH.\"",
      "Mr. Trump included in his social media post a letter he received from Cuellar's daughters requesting clemency for their parents.",
      "The two women, Christina and Catherine Cuellar, wrote in their letter, dated Nov. 12, that they believed the congressman's \"independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began.\"",
      "\"He has never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from policies of the previous administration,\" they told the president.",
      "Cuellar's daughters also appeared to reference Mr. Trump's own criminal cases, which they called his \"challenges.\" They said they prayed for the president and his family \"because we know that behind the headlines, there are real people who hurt, who love and who still hope for better days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced federal charges in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, though both\u00a0ended after he won the presidency last year. A state prosecution in Georgia related to the 2020 election was also dismissed last week. The president was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "In last year's indictment against the Cuellars, federal prosecutors accused them of accepting at least $598,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. They alleged that the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Cuellar of acting as a foreign agent to benefit the government of Azerbaijan.",
      "He faced 14 counts, including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. Cuellar and his wife pleaded not guilty.",
      "The congressman, who served as the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, stepped down from the post while the case continued. Cuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and currently represents the 28th Congressional District, which stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. He\u00a0won reelection\u00a0last year, defeating his Republican opponent by more than 13,000 votes.",
      "The president's decision to grant clemency to Cuellar comes as Mr. Trump has faced backlash for his recent use of the pardon power, namely for providing reprieve to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted last year of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.",
      "Hernandez had been sentenced to 45 years\u00a0in prison after he was found guilty of drug trafficking and weapons charges. But in announcing his decision to pardon Hernandez, Mr. Trump said he was treated \"very harshly and unfairly.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-trump-has-said-about-pursuing-a-third-term/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:47:50 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has previously suggested he's eyeing ways to run again for president. But he downplayed talk of a third term in his latest comments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president said in late October that he is \"not allowed to run\" again. When asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",
      "\"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Oct. 29 aboard Air Force One during a trip to Asia, the president said it's \"too bad\" the U.S. Constitution doesn't permit him to serve a third term.",
      "\"If you read it, it's pretty clear,\" the president said of the Constitution. \"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad.\"",
      "Ratified in 1951, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution\u00a0bars anyone\u00a0from being elected to more than two terms.",
      "Trump says he has a \"little more than three years\" left in office",
      "Speaking to supporters at a White House Christmas party on Dec. 1, the president acknowledged he has a \"little more than three years\" left in his presidency.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday formally announced a new immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans, the latest city led by Democrats to see a surge in Border Patrol agents tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "DHS said it dubbed the operation \"Catahoula Crunch,\" confirming plans reported by CBS News in mid-November. At the time, CBS News reported that Border Patrol was planning to dispatch roughly 200 agents to New Orleans, to oversee operations there targeting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Internal agency documents showed officials requested armored vehicles for the operation.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration targeted New Orleans because of local policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,\" McLaughlin added. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.\"",
      "Catahoulas are the official state dogs of Louisiana.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News that DHS has asked the Department of Defense for permission to use Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans as a staging area for immigration operations.",
      "Coinciding with the DHS announcement, the FBI's field office in New Orleans said it was partnering with the Louisiana State Police to protect the federal immigration agents deployed to the area and to curtail \"attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was planning to deploy National Guard troops to New Orleans for a separate anti-crime operation \"in a couple of weeks,\" though the administration has not announced an exact date. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has welcomed the plan to dispatch National Guard members, saying the deployment is needed to curb violent crime.",
      "The Border Patrol crackdown in New Orleans is the most recent immigration enforcement operation launched by the second Trump administration in a Democratic-controlled city. The administration has deployed hundreds of Border Patrol agents to cities far away from a U.S. border, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Border Patrol's operations, led by controversial commander Gregory Bovino, have been met with harsh criticism from some local residents and elected officials, who have accused Bovino and his agents of inflaming tensions through aggressive arrests and heavy handed tactics against protesters and other civilians. A federal judge in the Chicago area ruled that Border Patrol's use of force had been excessive.",
      "But Bovino has also been praised by supporters as a no-nonsense enforcer of Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. He has defended his agents' actions, including their use of force against protesters, as justified given violent acts by some individuals.",
      "Who Border Patrol has been arresting in these operations has also garnered controversy. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents have been depicted on video smashing car windows and arresting day laborers and other workers during \"roving patrols\" at Home Depot parking lots and other locations.",
      "While Bovino and other Trump administration officials have said Border Patrol is primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed serious crimes, CBS News reported last month that out of roughly 270 arrests in the Charlotte area, fewer than 90 detainees \u2014 roughly one third \u2014 were classified as criminals.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:00:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the bonus would be given only to controllers and technicians who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, the ranking member on the Senate's aviation subcommittee, is demanding the Transportation Department expand its $10,000 bonus to all air traffic controllers and FAA technicians who worked without pay during the government shutdown. The department said it would give the bonuses only to those who did not miss a day of work during the 44-day shutdown.",
      "\"Excluding 96 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Controller and Technician workforce from this bonus is unfair, divisive and disrespectful to the over 20,000 dedicated Federal employees who worked under extremely stressful conditions to ensure our Nation Airspace System (NAS) was safe during the 2025 shutdown,\" Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth wrote in a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, first obtained by CBS News.",
      "Duckworth told CBS News it was \"an insult\" to the controllers and said that \"at a time when we should be doing everything we can to retain and recruit air traffic controllers, the Trump Administration choosing to punish and alienate 96% of the FAA's controller and technician workforce is completely counterproductive.\"",
      "Last month, the Transportation Department announced 776 air traffic controllers and technicians would receive the $10,000 bonuses.",
      "\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a press release announcing the bonuses. \"This award is an acknowledgement of their dedication and a heartfelt appreciation for going above and beyond in service to the nation.\"",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, or NATCA, the union representing controllers, expressed concern that only 311 of its members would receive a bonus.",
      "\"Although we agree that the work performed by these aviation safety professionals during the shutdown deserves recognition, praise, and our collective gratitude, we are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition,\" the union said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Similar bonuses are being given to TSA officers who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Last week, during the busy Thanksgiving travel rush, CBS News pressed Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford about the controller bonuses, noting that some controllers said they had just missed a day or so of work because of child care needs or illness.",
      "\"The administrator and I have been very grateful through the course of the shutdown and recognizing some of the difficult circumstances our controllers were going through,\" Duffy answered. \"But, you know, we have to look and say, where's the cutoff? And if you got 100% on your test, you get the sticker \u2014 that's a scratch and sniff sticker \u2014 from the administration.\"",
      "Duffy stressed that all controllers received full pay, whether or not they worked during the shutdown.",
      "\"I think in the future, a lot of controllers would think, 'Hey, there could be a reward when I show up, and I'm going to do all I can to be there every single day to serve the American people. And I know that I'll get paid at one point, but if I have a perfect attendance record, there could be a reward at the end of that rainbow.'\"",
      "But Duckworth expressed concern that this could \"create a perverse and dangerous incentive that threatens to weaken NAS safety during future shutdowns.\"",
      "\"Controllers will have a financial incentive to avoid using authorized leave\u2014even while suffering from illness that degrade controller performance and risk infecting an entire cadre of employees working a shift,\" Duckworth wrote. \"Air Traffic Organization jobs are extremely stressful for good reason: one mistake may be deadly. These dedicated professionals must be at their best when on the job, but your policy encourages Air Traffic Controllers and Technicians to show up regardless of their health. That is incredibly dangerous. Sick leave exists for a reason.\"",
      "The ranking Democrats on the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, and on the House Aviation Subcommittee, Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, have also called for all controllers to receive a bonus. They say that not rewarding the entire work force \"is wrong.\"",
      "The Transportation Department has promised the $10,000 bonus payments will be paid by Dec. 9.",
      "\"[W]hen FAA is operating 3,800 fully certified controllers short of the agency's staffing target, and Air Traffic Controller morale is rapidly plummeting to new lows, the absolute last thing the Trump administration should be doing is excluding thousands of dedicated patriots who worked without pay during the most recent shutdown from the $10,000 award,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She told Duffy, \"I simply want you to act swiftly in issuing $10,000 awards to the entire dedicated Air Traffic Controller and Technician workforce that patriotically worked without pay during the 2025 government shutdown to ensure the safety of the skies.\"",

    "story": [
      "A report by the Pentagon's internal watchdog into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal could be made public this week, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, months after Hegseth and several other top Trump administration officials accidentally included a journalist in a group chat on the messaging app to discuss strikes in Yemen.",
      "A copy of the Pentagon inspector general's report has been sent to Congress, and a redacted and unclassified version is expected to be released to the public as early as Thursday, the source said.",
      "Axios was first to report on the planned release.",
      "The probe began eight months ago at the request of lawmakers. Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins said in an April memo that his office was seeking to \"determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business.\"",
      "Days earlier, The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he was added to an 18-person Signal chat that administration officials used to discuss the details of a sensitive operation to bomb the Houthis, a group that controls much of Yemen.",
      "The texts published by Goldberg \u2014 sent in a chat called \"Houthi PC small group\" \u2014 appeared to include details from Hegseth's account on the timing of strikes and the aircraft used, along with updates from then-National Security Advisor Michael Waltz's account and messages from Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The National Security Council later confirmed that the messages appeared to be authentic, though the White House asserted that the messages in the chat weren't classified. President Trump stood by his staff at the time.",
      "Waltz, who has since been shifted to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, later acknowledged that he created the chat group, calling the situation \"embarrassing\" but adding that he isn't sure how Goldberg's number was added.",
      "The incident drew backlash from Democrats, who demanded to know how a reporter was inadvertently added to a seemingly highly sensitive discussion and whether security was compromised. Signal is popular because its end-to-end encryption technology makes it difficult for third parties to view messages, though human error poses a risk for any messaging platform, and experts have warned about phishing scams over Signal and other apps.",
      "CBS News reported over the summer that the inspector general had obtained evidence that messages sent from Hegseth's account included details from a classified email. Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said at the time that the department stood by its prior statements that \"no classified information was shared via Signal.\"",
      "Other critics have questioned whether the Signal messages would be retained in accordance with records laws. Goldberg wrote that some messages were set to disappear after a week.",
      "Stebbins, the Pentagon's inspector general, said in April his team would review whether users followed \"classification and records retention requirements.\"",
      "In April, sources told CBS News that Hegseth shared details about the Yemen strikes in a second private Signal group that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "The report is expected to be made public at a delicate moment for Hegseth. Last week, The Washington Post reported that a Sept. 2 attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea included multiple strikes, with the military reportedly carrying out a follow-on strike to kill a pair of survivors because Hegseth allegedly said the operation should kill everybody. The Trump administration confirmed that there was a second strike but denied that it was ordered by Hegseth.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have demanded more details and suggested an order to kill shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has said the strikes were lawful and the follow-on strike was ordered by the officer in charge of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley.",

That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",

      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",
      "O'Hara added that officers will receive additional guidance later this week regarding the department's immigration policy.",
      "Many Somali Americans in Minnesota say they've felt a growing sense of uneasiness after Mr. Trump's continued rhetoric against Somalis, which has sparked frustration and fear.",
      "\"I was only 3 years old when I came and this is my home,\" Madino Mudey said. \"This has to stop.\"",
      "A few people at Minneapolis' busiest Somali mall say they noticed what they believe to be federal agents circling the property Tuesday, but authorities haven't confirmed that.",
      "Gov. Walz calls reports of ICE operation \"PR stunt\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Walz responded to the reports that ICE would target undocumented Somalis in the Twin Cities, calling it \"a PR stunt.\"",
      "\"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime,\" Walz added. \"Indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",
      "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., numbering roughly 80,000 people, according to Minnesota Compass, a project of Wilder Research. Many fled the long civil war in their East African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of \"less than a dozen\" immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.",
      "But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the number of those at earlier stages of the immigration process is a \"pretty small\" proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.",
      "The history behind Minnesota's Somali-American community",
      "Dr. Ahmed Samatar, the founding dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, spoke with WCCO in 2019 about why so many Somali-Americans have made \"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\" home.",
      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",
      "According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, 13,582 Somali refugees came to Minnesota between 2005 and 2018.",
      "\"Of course, when some came, they will tell others about the good news of Minnesota,\" Samatar said. \"I call that the 'call of kinship.'\"",
      "He thinks there are a variety of reasons for what are called \"secondary arrivals,\" but there are a few that stand out. One is the support from local, volunteer resettlement agencies that work with governments to help refugees find housing, schooling and jobs.",
      "Samatar also cited Minnesota's strong economy, which gave Somali-Americans job opportunities \u2014 many in western Minnesota \u2014 schooling options, health care and a safe place to live.",
      "\"The state of Minnesota has always been considered a kind and successful place,\" he said.",

      "\"I want affordable housing, so when you're going to build market-rate housing, 20% over that is going to be affordable housing,\" McGreevey said, \"and it's not going to be separate, it's going to part of the same building.\"",

    "summary": "Republican candidate Matt Van Epps is on track to defeat Democrat Aftyn Behn in a special election for Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, the AP projected.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans will hold onto Tennessee's 7th Congressional District despite a push by Democrats to flip the deep-red seat, the Associated Press projected Tuesday, as Republican candidate Matt Van Epps is on track to defeat Democrat Aftyn Behn.",
      "Tuesday's special election, held after the resignation of Republican Rep. Mark Green, drew nationwide attention and was widely viewed as a referendum on President Trump. The president endorsed Van Epps during the primaries, participated in a phone rally for the GOP candidate on the eve of the election and congratulated him on Tuesday evening.",
      "Green won in the district \u2014 which includes parts of Nashville and its suburbs, rural areas and part of the Fort Campbell military base \u2014 by a decisive 21 points last year. Van Epps, a combat veteran,\u00a0appeared to be on track to fall somewhat short of that margin.",
      "Republicans entered Election Day hoping to scuttle Democratic claims that even red districts are now in play as Trump struggles with low approval ratings and persistent economic dissatisfaction. The party is also fighting to defend its single-digit majority in the House.",
      "Democrats won by wide margins in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere last month, and they hoped that a strong showing in Tennessee \u2014 or even a narrow loss \u2014 could further embolden the party ahead of midterm elections next year. Democrats were also buoyed by polls that showed a closer-than-expected race, including one that showed a\u00a0low-single-digit\u00a0contest.",
      "Outside money poured into the district, with at least $8 million spent on the race, a CBS News analysis found. The Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. spent more than $1.6 million backing Van Epps, and Behn drew close to $1 million in support from the Democratic-focused House Majority PAC.",
      "Van Epps has tied himself closely to Mr. Trump, who called the race a \"big deal\" during a phone rally Monday that also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson. In a victory speech Tuesday, Van Epps said: \"Running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin visited to campaign for Behn, and former Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a canvassing kickoff while in Nashville on a book tour. Former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a virtual rally for her Monday.",
      "Behn focused her campaign on fiery criticisms of Trump administration economic policies that she said prioritize wealthy people and corporations, including Mr. Trump's tariffs and budget and spending law, both of which Van Epps supports.",
      "But Republicans created a steady drumbeat of Behn's own words used against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a \"radical\" and made harsh remarks about Nashville and its tourist draws.",

Meanwhile, millions of dollars in outside spending have poured in, while top figures in both parties have stumped for the candidates in recent days.",
      "Still, a Democratic victory in the deep-red Tennessee district would be an uphill climb. But onlookers will be watching to see whether the race comes within a single-digit margin as a possible harbinger of what's to come in next year's elections.",
      "An indicator for the midterms",
      "The outcome of Tuesday's special election will all but certainly be viewed as an indicator for what's to come in next year's midterm elections, as Democrats tout a string of recent victories.",
      "Traditional political wisdom dictates that the party that controls the White House often loses ground in midterm elections. And the Tennessee special election follows overperformance by Democrats in special elections in September, along with a sweep across key races in November's elections that the party has pointed to as evidence of a changing tide among the electorate after bruising 2024 elections for the party.",
      "In last month's races, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill handily won their gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for mayor.",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore, who represented Tennessee in Congress, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who spoke at a phone rally for Behn on Monday. Gore said during November's elections, \"bipartisan and independent voters served notice, with massive landslides, that they're sick and tired of Trump's madness and cruelty.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:53:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has halted all immigration applications filed by people from 19 countries, according to internal government guidance, its latest move to restrict legal immigration pathways.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has halted all immigration applications filed by people from 19 countries, its latest move to restrict legal immigration pathways following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last week, according to internal government guidance and a source familiar with the move.",
      "The internal U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services guidance obtained by CBS News shows the agency directed employees on Monday to \"stop final adjudication on all cases\" involving individuals from 19 nations that are facing restrictions under a proclamation President Trump issued in June. Colloquially, that proclamation is known as the travel ban.",
      "That pause includes the completion of citizenship ceremonies for legal U.S. permanent residents from the list of 19 countries who were on the cusp of becoming naturalized American citizens, the USCIS document said. It suggested the suspension is an interim step while the administration develops further guidance on the vetting of the affected immigrants.",
      "\"This hold includes all form types and making any final decisions (approvals, denials) as well as completing any oath ceremonies,\" the guidance to USCIS offices said.",
      "Mr. Trump's June proclamation imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "The new guidance indicates that the immigration crackdown directed by Mr. Trump following last week's shooting of the National Guard members is much broader in scope than previously reported. The man accused of shooting the two Guard members, one of whom has died, is an Afghan evacuee who entered the U.S. in September 2021, under the Biden administration, and who was granted asylum in April 2025, after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has publicly announced a series of immigration restrictions since the attack, including a pause on all asylum decisions by USCIS, a categorical suspension of visa and immigration processing for Afghans and a review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 nations on the travel ban.",
      "But the administration had not publicly announced it had also frozen all USCIS cases \u2014 not just green card applications \u2014 involving nationals of the 19 countries on the list, including citizenship requests. To qualify for U.S. citizenship, immigrants typically must have been legal permanent residents for three or five years, depending on their cases.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, did not dispute the planned suspension of applications. The agency said \"the Trump Administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best.\"",
      "\"We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake,\" DHS added. \"The Trump Administration is reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from Countries of Concern.\"",
      "Some time on Tuesday, USCIS posted a memo online, dated Dec. 2, memorializing the immigration restrictions the administration has announced since last week's attack.",
      "The memo formalized the suspension of asylum requests overseen by USCIS for all nationalities pending a \"comprehensive review;\" the pause on all immigration applications filed by immigrants from the 19 countries listed on the travel ban, regardless of when they entered the U.S.; and the \"re-review\" of the cases of nationals of those countries who arrived after former President Joe Biden took office in January 2021 and whose requests were approved.",
      "The policy said everyone who falls into those categories will now be subject to a \"thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility,\" including because of suspected terrorism ties or criminality.",
      "The policy says the application pause will only be lifted when the USCIS director issues another memo. \"Any requests to lift the hold due to litigation or other extraordinary circumstances must receive approval from the USCIS Director or Deputy Director,\" the memo said.",

      "One of the judges who was fired was Amiena Khan, an assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, the official said. Khan oversaw other immigration judges there.",
      "According to the official, 98 judges have been fired nationally since January, including 12 assistant chief immigration judges. The official said that an almost equal number have taken early out options, retired or resigned since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "A spokeswoman at the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, which has control over immigration judges and courts, declined to comment Tuesday on personnel matters.",
      "The New York Times first reported the firings on Monday.",
      "There were about 700 immigration judges in the country to start the year, and we are now down below 600, the National Association of Immigration Judges official said. A tax bill passed in Congress and signed by President Trump in July called for 800 permanent immigration judges and judge teams to support them.",
      "Since January, according to the official, the Justice Department has hired and placed 11 new permanent judges and 25 temporary judges with military backgrounds on six-month terms.",
      "In an emailed statement, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: \"After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety.\"",
      "In July, three immigration judges spoke out about their firings by the Justice Department, telling CBS News the firings were \"arbitrary, unfair\" and \"an attack on the rule of law.\" The Justice Department had no comment at the time on the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases, and in September, a defense official confirmed to CBS News that the Pentagon is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges.",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tells reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\"",
      "But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed. He said he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Dec. 2: Hegseth says he didn't watch second strike and didn't see any survivors",
      "During a Cabinet meeting, Hegseth tells reporters he watched the first boat strike on Sept. 2 live, but had \"moved on to my next meeting\" before the boat was hit a second time.",
      "\"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs.\"",
      "He said he later learned that Bradley chose to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat,\" which Hegseth said was the right decision.",
      "Hegseth also said he did not \"personally see survivors\" following the first strike \"because the thing was on fire,\" calling the situation the \"fog of war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know about the second strike\" when asked about his comment over the weekend that he wouldn't have wanted a follow-on attack.",
      "\"To me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" the president said.",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Hegseth defended the administration's strategy of striking vessels, saying, \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\"",

      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paul Finebaum, the longtime ESPN columnist, talk show host and sage of all things Southeastern Conference, told CBS News that newly minted Louisiana State University football coach Lane Kiffin is at least part of the reason he\u00a0opted not to run\u00a0for the U.S. Senate.",
      "Reached Tuesday during a commercial break of his eponymous weekday radio program, Finebaum called the process of exploring a potential campaign to succeed the departing Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama \"overwhelming.\"",
      "He said: \"I was intrigued, and I think it's always worse when people say, 'You're going to win.' I say, 'Great, how do you get to that point?'\"",
      "\"It was a great education, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process but ultimately, the last couple of days got to me,\" he added.",
      "He cited the drama and intrigue surrounding Kiffin's stunning decision to leave his coaching gig at Ole Miss \u2014 on the verge of an appearance in the College Football Playoffs \u2014 to coach at LSU as a reason to continue informing and entertaining his audience.",
      "\"Here I am, I'm covering a guy who's being disloyal, and I ultimately felt a loyalty to the people who employ me and support me,\" Finebaum said of Kiffin.",
      "Finebaum, 70, whose sports journalism career arcs back to the Birmingham Post-Herald, has been an ESPN radio talk show host since 2013. His program is simulcast on ESPN's SEC Network.",
      "He\u00a0hinted in September\u00a0that he was weighing a Senate run, telling political and sports pundit Clay Travis that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this year prompted an \"awakening\" for him. Finebaum\u00a0moved back to the Birmingham area\u00a0earlier this year after hosting his radio show out of Charlotte.",
      "Finebaum said GOP leaders and operatives advised he'd likely need to raise at least $10 million for a campaign.",
      "\"I've never asked anyone for money in my life. People around me said it was doable, and some of it \u2014 it got to a point I heard 'name ID' so many times my head started spinning,\" he said.",
      "Kiffin announced his decision to head to LSU over the weekend amid a dispute with Ole Miss over whether he could coach the team through the playoffs. When Ole Miss said no, Kiffin bolted and took at least one assistant coach with him to Louisiana.",
      "Tuberville, the former football coach for Auburn University, announced in May that he's running to succeed Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, sparking an open contest for his Senate seat next year.",
      "With Finebaum staying behind the microphone, former Navy SEAL Jared Hudson, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and Rep. Barry Moore are running or preparing to do so.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit that former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey brought against it\u200b, saying she didn't properly follow administrative complaint procedures before suing.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department will seek to dismiss a lawsuit that former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey brought against it, arguing she didn't properly follow administrative complaint procedures before suing.",
      "The government laid out its argument in court papers filed Monday prior to a Thursday hearing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "Comey, a former federal prosecutor in New York who handled criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Trump administration in September over\u00a0her firing\u00a0in July, saying her ouster was \"unlawful and unconstitutional.\" In their\u00a0complaint, Comey's attorneys argued that her termination was \"politically motivated\" and an overreach of presidential authority.",
      "Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has publicly clashed with President Trump for years. In 2017, Mr. Trump\u00a0terminated\u00a0James Comey as FBI director, amid the department's investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia.",
      "James Comey was indicted by a grand jury in September on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. A federal judge last week ordered the criminal charges against him be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed to the role. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "The Justice Department indicated its planned defense to Maurene Comey's lawsuit in a joint letter submitted Monday to Judge Jesse M. Furman by Maurene Comey's lawyers and the chief of the civil division of the federal prosecutor's office in Albany.",
      "The government's sections in the letter argued her lawsuit was not properly before the court because she did not fully comply with administrative procedures requiring the Merit Systems Protection Board to first consider her claim. It rejected her lawsuit's claim that the notice of appeal she filed with the board in August was futile.",
      "The board, the Justice Department maintained in the letter, was \"the appropriate forum to determine whether, as Ms. Comey claims, her removal was a prohibited personnel action or an arbitrary and capricious agency action.\"",
      "Maurene Comey's lawyers said in the filing that the board \"lacks expertise to adjudicate this novel dispute\" and was not an appropriate forum because \"this case raises foundational constitutional questions with respect to the separation of powers.\" They also argued that it was \"no longer true\" that the board functions independently of the president.",
      "A lawyer for Maurene Comey referred CBS News to the letter on Tuesday.",
      "Before her firing in July, Maurene Comey was an assistant U.S. attorney in the high-profile U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, where she had worked since 2015. Her lawyers wrote in their lawsuit that she was fired one day after she had \"been asked to take the lead on a major public corruption case.\" Just months before, she had received an \"outstanding\" review from supervisors, the complaint said.",
      "Last month, U.S. Attorney John Sarcone in Albany took on the case and indicated his office will defend the Trump administration in the lawsuit. The move followed the recusal of prosecutors in Manhattan, where Maurene Comey had secured guilty verdicts in several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell and the bribery convictions of former Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife.",
      "Two weeks before Maurene Comey was fired, a jury convicted Combs of prostitution-related charges, though it acquitted him of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. She led the prosecution team. Combs, 56, is scheduled for release from prison in June 2028.",
      "Maxwell, 63, was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges after a jury found she aided the sex abuse of girls and women by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was found dead in his federal jail cell in August 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking charge. His death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence at a prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred last summer from a prison in Florida.",
      "Robert Menendez, 71, is imprisoned in Pennsylvania. He is scheduled for release in September 2034.",
      "Joe  Walsh and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in his anti-narcotics campaign.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in the U.S. military's campaign of lethal strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not definitively say when or where any possible land strikes might take place.",
      "Officials have discussed possible military operations in Venezuela in recent weeks, CBS News has previously reported, as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels \u2014 a charge Maduro denies.",
      "But Mr. Trump said Tuesday that land strikes would not necessarily be limited to Venezuela. He said any country where illicit drugs are produced or trafficked \"is subject to attack,\" and singled out neighboring Colombia, which the U.S. has accused of failing to control the drug trade.",
      "The president has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration's sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is \"totally prepared\" to carry out land strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military has built up its presence in the Caribbean, dispatching the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region and sending F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. And over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.",
      "If the president takes the step of ordering strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward\u00a0of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Those boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.",
      "And The Washington Post reported last week that the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to the vessel's wreckage, which some lawmakers and experts argue could constitute a war crime. The White House confirmed there was a second strike, but maintained that the operation was legal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday that any land attack \"would be an act of war, and Congress would invoke the War Powers Act,\" referring to the 1973 law that limits the president's authority to make war without congressional authorization.",
      "Efforts in Congress to limit Mr. Trump's campaign have run into opposition so far. The Senate narrowly\u00a0voted down a resolution last month that would have prevented any strikes against Venezuela without a declaration of war, with 49 senators \u2014 including two Republicans \u2014 voting in support. A month earlier, a vote to end the strikes on alleged drug boats also failed.",
      "Land strikes would also likely face heavy pushback in Latin America. In response to Mr. Trump's comments, Colombian President Gustavo Petro defended his government's anti-narcotics efforts, but warned: \"Do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the jaguar.\"",
      "Venezuelan officials have also accused the Trump administration of intimidating the country and seeking Maduro's ouster. Mr. Trump has not said what his intentions are with Venezuela, but told reporters in mid-November he's \"sort of\" made up his mind on how to proceed.",

      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hernandez's trial.",

    "story": [
      "The Canadian publishing house behind the \"Franklin\" children's books appeared to condemn Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Monday, after the top military official posted a cartoon image of the famous anthropomorphic turtle blowing up an apparent drug boat.",
      "Hegseth's post \u2014 which shows Franklin shooting a rocket-propelled grenade from a helicopter, with the faux book title \"Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists\" \u2014 appeared on the defense secretary's X account Sunday evening, as questions swirled about the Trump administration's monthslong campaign of boat strikes around South America, and specifically a reported second strike targeting survivors who were in the water.",
      "A day later, Toronto-based Kids Can Press said in a statement posted to social media: \"Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity. We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values.\"",
      "Kids Can Press is the publisher of more than a dozen picture books that depict Franklin navigating life with his parents and friends, with titles like \"Franklin Rides a Bike,\" \"Franklin Goes to School\" and \"Franklin Goes to the Hospital.\" The stories have also been adapted for TV.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Kids Can Press for comment. In a statement Monday night, Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News: \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels... or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists.\"",
      "For your Christmas wish list\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pLXzg20SaL",
      "Hegseth's post drew flak earlier Monday from Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a retired Navy captain who is\u00a0facing a controversial investigation by the Pentagon\u00a0for participating in a video that encouraged service members not to obey illegal orders.",
      "\"He is in the national command authority for nuclear weapons, and last night he's putting out, on the internet, turtles with rocket-propelled grenades,\" Kelly told reporters. \"I mean, have you seen this? This is the secretary of defense. This is not a serious person.\"",
      "Days before Hegseth's post, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. military carried out more than one strike on a single boat on Sept. 2, killing two survivors from the initial attack after Hegseth allegedly ordered the military to kill everybody onboard. The White House confirmed Monday that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the second strike may have been a war crime, pointing to domestic and international laws forbidding military forces from attacking wounded people who no longer pose a threat. One Pentagon manual says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has said its boat attacks have complied with the law and argues that the strikes are necessary to crack down on drug trafficking.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday that Adm. Frank Bradley, who commanded the Sept. 2 operation, \"worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Hegseth posted Monday on social media that Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",

    "summary": "The government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite\u00a0President Trump's assertion\u00a0that the airspace of the South American country should be considered closed.",
      "The government of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.",
      "An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquet\u00eda International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.",
      "Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.",
      "Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.",
      "Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.",
      "The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.",
      "\"You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,\" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. \"We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.\"",
      "Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.",
      "Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.",
      "\"Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,\" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: \"Not just Venezuela.\"",
      "Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and\u00a0bipartisan concerns in Congress\u00a0that a\u00a0follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat\u00a0may have constituted a war crime.",
      "As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries,\u00a0Pope Leo XVI\u00a0on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, told reporters aboard the papal plane\u00a0returning from Lebanon\u00a0that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas were trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.",
      "\"The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,\" he said. \"On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.\"",
      "He stressed that he didn't have further information. \"Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure \u2014 including economic pressure \u2014 \u00a0but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is seeking to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",
      "No member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the current law and no public records exist indicating that any officials have ever paid fines for disclosure errors, according to James R. Copland, a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank.",
      "Luna called\u00a0last month's hearing \"for show,\" and expressed concern that watered-down legislation \"with no teeth\" could end up on the floor instead of the compromise bill.",

    "story": [
      "The suspect in last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., has been charged with murder and assault with intent to kill while armed. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was ordered held without bond during an initial court appearance Tuesday.",
      "Lakanwal appeared virtually from a D.C. hospital, where he remains after being shot by law enforcement after allegedly shooting the two National Guard members, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom, 20, died of her injuries, and Wolfe remains hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's initial appearance said that the government's case was \"exceedingly strong.\"",
      "According to charging documents in District of Columbia Superior Court, Lakanwal allegedly yelled \"Allahu Akbar!\" as he fired his gun at Beckstrom and Wolfe. The phrase is Arabic for God is great. According to the documents, another National Guard member fired a service weapon and hit Lakanwal as he was reloading his gun. Lakanwal was also charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Security footage from the scene of the shooting cited in the charges shows Lakanwal standing near a popular subway stop located near the scene of the shooting, before \"running in the direction of the intersection\" where Wolfe and Beckstrom were walking.",
      "After striking both guard members with his initial rounds of shots, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal attempted to chase and shoot at another National Guard member nearby. In one screenshot of security footage, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal bent down next to Beckstrom and Wolfe after shooting them.",
      "Last week, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that Lakanwal would be charged with additional crimes as the case proceeds: \"There will be no stone left unturned.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said that she is considering seeking the death penalty for Lakanwal.",
      "After the shooting, sources told CBS News that Lakanwal served on a CIA-backed operations team for about eight years and said that he suffered from PTSD.",
      "He and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan and were brought into the United States in 2021, and his asylum case was approved earlier this year. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health had deteriorated in recent years and that he had become isolated and detached from his family.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack as reason to further expand its ongoing immigration crackdown, halting all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, and ordering a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries.",
      "Lakanwal's next court appearance is scheduled for mid-January.",

      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack in Washington \u2014 which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025 \u2014 to further expand its immigration crackdown. It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",

Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:32:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

The flare was classified as X1.9 flare, the space agency said. X-classes are the most intense kind of flare. The eruption came from a newly emerging sunspot region.",
      "The flare briefly knocked out radio communications across Australia and parts of southeast Asia on Tuesday, Space.com reported.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Nov 2025 16:31:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:44:21 -0500",
    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "title": "Kids with smartphones by age 12 at higher risk of health issues, study says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Wednesday that he is pardoning Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was indicted last year on more than a dozen federal charges\u00a0related to bribery allegations.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the pardon for Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, on Truth Social, claiming their prosecution was the result of weaponization by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight \u2014 Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president wrote, alleging that Cuellar's opposition to Biden's immigration policies was the reason he was indicted.",
      "The president wrote that the Texas Democrat \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders and the Biden Border 'Catastrophe'\" and accused Biden of deliberately targeting the congressman and his wife \"simply for speaking the TRUTH.\"",
      "Mr. Trump included in his social media post a letter he received from Cuellar's daughters requesting clemency for their parents.",
      "The two women, Christina and Catherine Cuellar, wrote in their letter, dated Nov. 12, that they believed the congressman's \"independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began.\"",
      "\"He has never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from policies of the previous administration,\" they told the president.",
      "Cuellar's daughters also appeared to reference Mr. Trump's own criminal cases, which they called his \"challenges.\" They said they prayed for the president and his family \"because we know that behind the headlines, there are real people who hurt, who love and who still hope for better days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced federal charges in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, though both\u00a0ended after he won the presidency last year. A state prosecution in Georgia related to the 2020 election was also dismissed last week. The president was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "In last year's indictment against the Cuellars, federal prosecutors accused them of accepting at least $598,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. They alleged that the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.",
      "The Justice Department also accused Cuellar of acting as a foreign agent to benefit the government of Azerbaijan.",
      "He faced 14 counts, including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. Cuellar and his wife pleaded not guilty.",
      "The congressman, who served as the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, stepped down from the post while the case continued. Cuellar was elected to the House in 2005 and currently represents the 28th Congressional District, which stretches from San Antonio south to the U.S.-Mexico border. He\u00a0won reelection\u00a0last year, defeating his Republican opponent by more than 13,000 votes.",
      "The president's decision to grant clemency to Cuellar comes as Mr. Trump has faced backlash for his recent use of the pardon power, namely for providing reprieve to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted last year of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.",
      "Hernandez had been sentenced to 45 years\u00a0in prison after he was found guilty of drug trafficking and weapons charges. But in announcing his decision to pardon Hernandez, Mr. Trump said he was treated \"very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "Hernandez was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday.",

      "Forecasts had predicted a rise in employment last month, with economists polled by FactSet expecting private employers to add more than 40,000 jobs.",
      "\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said in a statement.",
      "Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees drove the cuts in November, shedding 120,000 jobs.",
      "\"The 31,000 decline in private payrolls reported by ADP was driven by firms with less than 50 employees,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Small firms, those with less than 50 employees, have felt the pinch of policy uncertainty, rising input costs and high interest rates the most.\"",
      "The labor market weakness was led by cuts in the professional and business services industry, where employers eliminated 26,000 jobs. The leisure and hospitality sector gained 13,000 jobs, as establishments gear up for the busy holiday season.",
      "Although the ADP figures are not viewed as particularly predictive of overall job growth, they are still closely watched as a gauge of the U.S. economy, especially as official data is incomplete due to the 43-day federal government shutdown that ended in November.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-trump-has-said-about-pursuing-a-third-term/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:47:50 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has previously suggested he's eyeing ways to run again for president. But he downplayed talk of a third term in his latest comments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president said in late October that he is \"not allowed to run\" again. When asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",
      "\"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Oct. 29 aboard Air Force One during a trip to Asia, the president said it's \"too bad\" the U.S. Constitution doesn't permit him to serve a third term.",
      "\"If you read it, it's pretty clear,\" the president said of the Constitution. \"I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad.\"",
      "Ratified in 1951, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution\u00a0bars anyone\u00a0from being elected to more than two terms.",
      "Trump says he has a \"little more than three years\" left in office",
      "Speaking to supporters at a White House Christmas party on Dec. 1, the president acknowledged he has a \"little more than three years\" left in his presidency.",
      "\"We're going to do a great job,\" he said in a clip that one of his top aides, Margo Martin,\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, we have a little more than three years left, and three years for Trump is an eternity. That's a long period of time.\"",

      "On Saturday morning, an employee at the Ashland-area liquor store found the trash panda passed out on the bathroom floor at the end of his drunken escapade.",
      "\"I personally like raccoons,\" said Samantha Martin, an officer who works at the local animal control. \"They are funny little critters. He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything.\"",

      "\"Another day in the life of an animal control officer, I guess,\" she said.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday formally announced a new immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans, the latest city led by Democrats to see a surge in Border Patrol agents tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "DHS said it dubbed the operation \"Catahoula Crunch,\" confirming plans reported by CBS News in mid-November. At the time, CBS News reported that Border Patrol was planning to dispatch roughly 200 agents to New Orleans, to oversee operations there targeting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Internal agency documents showed officials requested armored vehicles for the operation.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration targeted New Orleans because of local policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,\" McLaughlin added. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.\"",

      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was planning to deploy National Guard troops to New Orleans for a separate anti-crime operation \"in a couple of weeks,\" though the administration has not announced an exact date. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has welcomed the plan to dispatch National Guard members, saying the deployment is needed to curb violent crime.",
      "The Border Patrol crackdown in New Orleans is the most recent immigration enforcement operation launched by the second Trump administration in a Democratic-controlled city. The administration has deployed hundreds of Border Patrol agents to cities far away from a U.S. border, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Border Patrol's operations, led by controversial commander Gregory Bovino, have been met with harsh criticism from some local residents and elected officials, who have accused Bovino and his agents of inflaming tensions through aggressive arrests and heavy handed tactics against protesters and other civilians. A federal judge in the Chicago area ruled that Border Patrol's use of force had been excessive.",
      "But Bovino has also been praised by supporters as a no-nonsense enforcer of Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. He has defended his agents' actions, including their use of force against protesters, as justified given violent acts by some individuals.",
      "Who Border Patrol has been arresting in these operations has also garnered controversy. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents have been depicted on video smashing car windows and arresting day laborers and other workers during \"roving patrols\" at Home Depot parking lots and other locations.",
      "While Bovino and other Trump administration officials have said Border Patrol is primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed serious crimes, CBS News reported last month that out of roughly 270 arrests in the Charlotte area, fewer than 90 detainees \u2014 roughly one third \u2014 were classified as criminals.",

      "Stock investing for babies",
      "Dell, who is ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the world's 11th richest person with net worth of $148 billion, said he and his wife were inspired by the Invest America program, which is the formal name of the Trump accounts. The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",
      "What are Trump accounts?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",
      "The accounts are limited to investing in broad U.S. stock funds that track the overall market, such as a S&P 500 fund, don't use leverage and charge no more than 0.1% in annual fees. Parents can make elections for their children's accounts at trumpaccounts.gov.",
      "The accounts are locked until the child turns 18, at which point the funds may be used for qualified expenses, which include:",
      "Education, such as college tuition or professional trainingHomeownership via a down payment on a first homeEntrepreneurship, or the funds to start a business",

      "When children turn 18, they may also opt to keep the money in the account and continue to invest.",
      "How will the Dells' contributions work?",
      "The $250 contributions will also be made through Invest America accounts, according to a fact sheet about the Dells' plan.",
      "The $250 will be contributed to accounts for kids under 10 years old but who were born before 2025, and therefore don't qualify for the original Trump accounts, the Dells said. Children who are eligible for the $1,000 under the original Invest America plan don't qualify for the Dells' $250 investment.",
      "\"Priority goes to younger children if demand exceeds available funds,\" they noted. \"Any remaining funds may open eligibility for older children.\"",
      "The accounts will have the same guidelines as the $1,000 accounts, with the investments locked until the children turn 18 years old, at which point they can use the money for qualified expenses like education or buying a home.",
      "When the children turn 18, the accounts automatically convert to a traditional IRA, which means unused funds can continue to grow.",

      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",

      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "If you're saving for college, a 529 savings plan could be a better alternative, investment experts said. It lets families sock away money tax-free for education expenses. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering accountholders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/duckworth-10000-bonus-air-traffic-controllers-faa-technicians/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:00:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the bonus would be given only to controllers and technicians who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, the ranking member on the Senate's aviation subcommittee, is demanding the Transportation Department expand its $10,000 bonus to all air traffic controllers and FAA technicians who worked without pay during the government shutdown. The department said it would give the bonuses only to those who did not miss a day of work during the 44-day shutdown.",
      "\"Excluding 96 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Controller and Technician workforce from this bonus is unfair, divisive and disrespectful to the over 20,000 dedicated Federal employees who worked under extremely stressful conditions to ensure our Nation Airspace System (NAS) was safe during the 2025 shutdown,\" Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth wrote in a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, first obtained by CBS News.",
      "Duckworth told CBS News it was \"an insult\" to the controllers and said that \"at a time when we should be doing everything we can to retain and recruit air traffic controllers, the Trump Administration choosing to punish and alienate 96% of the FAA's controller and technician workforce is completely counterproductive.\"",
      "Last month, the Transportation Department announced 776 air traffic controllers and technicians would receive the $10,000 bonuses.",
      "\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a press release announcing the bonuses. \"This award is an acknowledgement of their dedication and a heartfelt appreciation for going above and beyond in service to the nation.\"",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, or NATCA, the union representing controllers, expressed concern that only 311 of its members would receive a bonus.",
      "\"Although we agree that the work performed by these aviation safety professionals during the shutdown deserves recognition, praise, and our collective gratitude, we are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition,\" the union said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Similar bonuses are being given to TSA officers who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Last week, during the busy Thanksgiving travel rush, CBS News pressed Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford about the controller bonuses, noting that some controllers said they had just missed a day or so of work because of child care needs or illness.",
      "\"The administrator and I have been very grateful through the course of the shutdown and recognizing some of the difficult circumstances our controllers were going through,\" Duffy answered. \"But, you know, we have to look and say, where's the cutoff? And if you got 100% on your test, you get the sticker \u2014 that's a scratch and sniff sticker \u2014 from the administration.\"",
      "Duffy stressed that all controllers received full pay, whether or not they worked during the shutdown.",
      "\"I think in the future, a lot of controllers would think, 'Hey, there could be a reward when I show up, and I'm going to do all I can to be there every single day to serve the American people. And I know that I'll get paid at one point, but if I have a perfect attendance record, there could be a reward at the end of that rainbow.'\"",
      "But Duckworth expressed concern that this could \"create a perverse and dangerous incentive that threatens to weaken NAS safety during future shutdowns.\"",
      "\"Controllers will have a financial incentive to avoid using authorized leave\u2014even while suffering from illness that degrade controller performance and risk infecting an entire cadre of employees working a shift,\" Duckworth wrote. \"Air Traffic Organization jobs are extremely stressful for good reason: one mistake may be deadly. These dedicated professionals must be at their best when on the job, but your policy encourages Air Traffic Controllers and Technicians to show up regardless of their health. That is incredibly dangerous. Sick leave exists for a reason.\"",
      "The ranking Democrats on the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, and on the House Aviation Subcommittee, Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, have also called for all controllers to receive a bonus. They say that not rewarding the entire work force \"is wrong.\"",
      "The Transportation Department has promised the $10,000 bonus payments will be paid by Dec. 9.",
      "\"[W]hen FAA is operating 3,800 fully certified controllers short of the agency's staffing target, and Air Traffic Controller morale is rapidly plummeting to new lows, the absolute last thing the Trump administration should be doing is excluding thousands of dedicated patriots who worked without pay during the most recent shutdown from the $10,000 award,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She told Duffy, \"I simply want you to act swiftly in issuing $10,000 awards to the entire dedicated Air Traffic Controller and Technician workforce that patriotically worked without pay during the 2025 government shutdown to ensure the safety of the skies.\"",

    "summary": "A copy of the Pentagon inspector general's report has been sent to Congress, and a redacted and unclassified version is expected to be released to the public as early as Thursday, the source said.",
    "story": [
      "A report by the Pentagon's internal watchdog into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal could be made public this week, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, months after Hegseth and several other top Trump administration officials accidentally included a journalist in a group chat on the messaging app to discuss strikes in Yemen.",
      "A copy of the Pentagon inspector general's report has been sent to Congress, and a redacted and unclassified version is expected to be released to the public as early as Thursday, the source said.",
      "Axios was first to report on the planned release.",
      "The probe began eight months ago at the request of lawmakers. Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins said in an April memo that his office was seeking to \"determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business.\"",
      "Days earlier, The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he was added to an 18-person Signal chat that administration officials used to discuss the details of a sensitive operation to bomb the Houthis, a group that controls much of Yemen.",
      "The texts published by Goldberg \u2014 sent in a chat called \"Houthi PC small group\" \u2014 appeared to include details from Hegseth's account on the timing of strikes and the aircraft used, along with updates from then-National Security Advisor Michael Waltz's account and messages from Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The National Security Council later confirmed that the messages appeared to be authentic, though the White House asserted that the messages in the chat weren't classified. President Trump stood by his staff at the time.",
      "Waltz, who has since been shifted to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, later acknowledged that he created the chat group, calling the situation \"embarrassing\" but adding that he isn't sure how Goldberg's number was added.",
      "The incident drew backlash from Democrats, who demanded to know how a reporter was inadvertently added to a seemingly highly sensitive discussion and whether security was compromised. Signal is popular because its end-to-end encryption technology makes it difficult for third parties to view messages, though human error poses a risk for any messaging platform, and experts have warned about phishing scams over Signal and other apps.",
      "CBS News reported over the summer that the inspector general had obtained evidence that messages sent from Hegseth's account included details from a classified email. Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said at the time that the department stood by its prior statements that \"no classified information was shared via Signal.\"",
      "Other critics have questioned whether the Signal messages would be retained in accordance with records laws. Goldberg wrote that some messages were set to disappear after a week.",
      "Stebbins, the Pentagon's inspector general, said in April his team would review whether users followed \"classification and records retention requirements.\"",
      "In April, sources told CBS News that Hegseth shared details about the Yemen strikes in a second private Signal group that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "The report is expected to be made public at a delicate moment for Hegseth. Last week, The Washington Post reported that a Sept. 2 attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea included multiple strikes, with the military reportedly carrying out a follow-on strike to kill a pair of survivors because Hegseth allegedly said the operation should kill everybody. The Trump administration confirmed that there was a second strike but denied that it was ordered by Hegseth.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have demanded more details and suggested an order to kill shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has said the strikes were lawful and the follow-on strike was ordered by the officer in charge of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley.",

      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, a person familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "A U.S. official says ICE is planning to surge resources to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to launch immigration enforcement operations there targeting individuals with deportation orders. The region has the largest population of immigrants from Somalia in the U.S., some of whom have deportation orders.",
      "The enhanced ICE operations in the Twin Cities are expected to begin this week, the official said. The operations were\u00a0first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted, the person familiar with the planning said.",
      "Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss \"future or potential operations.\"",
      "President Trump: \"I don't want [Somalis] in our country\"",
      "In the midst of Tuesday's reports, President Trump took further aim at Minnesota's Somali community, the country of Somalia and the diaspora at large.",
      "\"They contribute nothing \u2026 I don't want them in our country,\" Trump said to the press on Tuesday. \"That's not politically correct, but I don't care. I don't want them here. Their country is no good for a reason.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Thanksgiving post where he also called Gov. Tim Walz a slur for people with intellectual disabilities, Mr. Trump said Somali refugees are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries to be reexamined and said he would end the temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, claiming, without evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state.\" The latter move would affect hundreds in the community.",
      "Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somali descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they \"have caused a lot of trouble,\" which is rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.",

      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",

    "summary": "Republican candidate Matt Van Epps is on track to defeat Democrat Aftyn Behn in a special election for Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, the AP projected.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans will hold onto Tennessee's 7th Congressional District despite a push by Democrats to flip the deep-red seat, the Associated Press projected Tuesday, as Republican candidate Matt Van Epps is on track to defeat Democrat Aftyn Behn.",
      "Tuesday's special election, held after the resignation of Republican Rep. Mark Green, drew nationwide attention and was widely viewed as a referendum on President Trump. The president endorsed Van Epps during the primaries, participated in a phone rally for the GOP candidate on the eve of the election and congratulated him on Tuesday evening.",
      "Green won in the district \u2014 which includes parts of Nashville and its suburbs, rural areas and part of the Fort Campbell military base \u2014 by a decisive 21 points last year. Van Epps, a combat veteran,\u00a0appeared to be on track to fall somewhat short of that margin.",
      "Republicans entered Election Day hoping to scuttle Democratic claims that even red districts are now in play as Trump struggles with low approval ratings and persistent economic dissatisfaction. The party is also fighting to defend its single-digit majority in the House.",
      "Democrats won by wide margins in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere last month, and they hoped that a strong showing in Tennessee \u2014 or even a narrow loss \u2014 could further embolden the party ahead of midterm elections next year. Democrats were also buoyed by polls that showed a closer-than-expected race, including one that showed a\u00a0low-single-digit\u00a0contest.",
      "Outside money poured into the district, with at least $8 million spent on the race, a CBS News analysis found. The Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. spent more than $1.6 million backing Van Epps, and Behn drew close to $1 million in support from the Democratic-focused House Majority PAC.",
      "Van Epps has tied himself closely to Mr. Trump, who called the race a \"big deal\" during a phone rally Monday that also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson. In a victory speech Tuesday, Van Epps said: \"Running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin visited to campaign for Behn, and former Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a canvassing kickoff while in Nashville on a book tour. Former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a virtual rally for her Monday.",
      "Behn focused her campaign on fiery criticisms of Trump administration economic policies that she said prioritize wealthy people and corporations, including Mr. Trump's tariffs and budget and spending law, both of which Van Epps supports.",
      "But Republicans created a steady drumbeat of Behn's own words used against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a \"radical\" and made harsh remarks about Nashville and its tourist draws.",

      "Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran, and Democrat Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, are vying for the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Green had represented the district, which stretches from parts of Nashville to the state's borders with Kentucky and Alabama and includes many rural counties, since 2019. He won his most recent race by more than 20 points.",
      "Though the election would normally be considered a safe win for Republicans, polling has shown a closer-than-expected race in The Volunteer State, including some that outline a single-digit race. Meanwhile, millions of dollars in outside spending have poured in, while top figures in both parties have stumped for the candidates in recent days.",
      "Still, a Democratic victory in the deep-red Tennessee district would be an uphill climb. But onlookers will be watching to see whether the race comes within a single-digit margin as a possible harbinger of what's to come in next year's elections.",
      "An indicator for the midterms",
      "The outcome of Tuesday's special election will all but certainly be viewed as an indicator for what's to come in next year's midterm elections, as Democrats tout a string of recent victories.",
      "Traditional political wisdom dictates that the party that controls the White House often loses ground in midterm elections. And the Tennessee special election follows overperformance by Democrats in special elections in September, along with a sweep across key races in November's elections that the party has pointed to as evidence of a changing tide among the electorate after bruising 2024 elections for the party.",
      "In last month's races, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill handily won their gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for mayor.",
      "With the dynamics in Tennessee, even a narrow loss in Tuesday's special election would be viewed as bolstering Democrats' momentum heading into the midterms.",
      "A special election with national attention",
      "Tuesday's special election has drawn national interest, with millions of dollars in outside spending, along with visits and phone rallies held by high-ranking members of both parties, who have poured into the district in recent days to support the candidates.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson stumped for Van Epps in the district Monday, framing the race as a contrast between the GOP \"delivering on our promises,\" and Democrats imposing their \"radical\" agenda.",
      "At one point, Johnson phoned a \"friend,\" who turned out to be the president. \"We have to win this seat,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd.",
      "\"Let's make it a sweeping victory. The whole world is watching Tennessee right now and they're watching your district,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a big vote, it's got to show something, and it's got to show that the Republican party is stronger than it's ever been.\"",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, who represented Tennessee in Congress, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who spoke at a phone rally for Behn on Monday. Gore said during November's elections, \"bipartisan and independent voters served notice, with massive landslides, that they're sick and tired of Trump's madness and cruelty.\"",
      "\"So it's no wonder that the president's begun to panic about tomorrow's election here in Tennessee,\" Gore said. \"The stage is set, and I do believe that Tennesseans are determined to claw back decency, self respect and common sense from the most corrupt and dangerous president in American history.\"",

    "summary": "Sasha DiGiulian free-climbed the roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall in Yosemite National Park over the course of 23 days.",
    "story": [
      "American climber Sasha DiGiulian has become the first woman to free-climb El Capitan's longest route \u2014 a journey she said ended up being the \"most formative and challenging climb\" of her career.",
      "\"When we got to the top, after 23 days of this climb, I took a step and I just started laughing cause I was like, I haven't walked in so long,\" DiGuilian told CBS News in a phone interview Monday.",
      "DiGiulian free-climbed the roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall in Yosemite National Park over the course of more than three weeks, nine days of which were spent waiting out bad weather on a wall ledge. Having eyed El Cap for years, DiGiulian is one of the few to summit via the long and difficult Platinum route.",
      "\"For the last few years I've been so committed to this specific line ... This climb kind of consumed me,\" she said.",
      "\"I was drawn to this particular route because it just seemed so audacious and hard and intimidating, and that's what excited me about it,\" she said in a separate interview with CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "DiGiulian, 33, and her climbing partner Elliot Faber were periodically accompanied by support personnel and a videographer.",
      "Made famous by the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo,\" which captured climber Alex Honnold's famed ascent in June 2017, El Capitan is more than twice the height of the Empire State Building in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California.",
      "The rock formation has 17 different free-climbing routes, according to DiGulian. Free-climbing is when climbers ascend with their hands and feet, using equipment and ropes only to protect against falling, which they set up in between pitches, or anchor points. In longer climbs like on El Capitan, climbers divide up the terrain into pieces.",
      "DiGiulian holds a World Champion title in rock climbing and is based in Boulder, Colorado. She confirmed to CBS News that the climbing emoji is based on her image.",
      "DiGiulian said she and Faber arrived in Yosemite on Oct. 8 and began preparations to spend 14-16 days climbing the Platinum route, also known as the Direct Line, which has 39 pitches. They established rope points and hiked with more than 30 gallons of water to the top of the rock wall to be accessed later on.",
      "Faber helped establish the route years ago, mapping out credit card-sized protrusions on rock, but he had not actually climbed it. That changed on Nov. 3, when DiGiulian and Faber began their ascent.",
      "Although they incorporated weather windows into their planning, an unforeseen storm brought everything to an abrupt halt on day nine. The duo set up camp on the 32nd pitch known as the mountain's Golden Edge to wait out wind, rain, cold and snow.",
      "\"This is my portaledge,\" DiGiulian says in an Instagram video on Nov. 14.",
      "The pair used a Jetboil to cook, ate freeze-dried food for dinner, consumed Send bars (a line of green protein bars DiGiulian invented herself), rationed Kindle battery to read, and went back and forth on airplane mode to communicate with the world below. DiGiulian also said the tent door flapping in the wind made it difficult to sleep. Despite battling fatigue, boredom and the elements, she said they enjoyed incredible mountain views, glorious sunrises and days on end to contemplate their mission.",
      "\"The storm was kind of this mental but also physical challenge because you're just stripped of any sense of normal,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "\"The winds were what scared me a lot, and then there was really intense thunder and lightning, she told Evans.",
      "Finally, after several days of being unable to climb, the weather started to let up. Despite the wet and slippery rock \u2014 very difficult climbing conditions \u2014 the pair resumed their ascent after 18 days on the wall, nine of which were spent waiting out the storm.",
      "The remaining terrain was some of the most difficult, and not made easier by the slick surfaces, DiGiulian said. She put on a helmet due to the ice chunks falling from the 400 feet above.",
      "\"I don't know what it is that enabled me to like to climb this route and get through it beyond just sheer drive to push myself,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Just short of the summit, Faber had to leave El Cap due to a family emergency. DiGiulian waited on the wall for two days, hoping they could finish together. When Faber was ultimately not able to return, he gave his partner his blessing to summit alone.",
      "\"He was just kind, I guess, between a rock and a hard place,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "Accompanied by some friends and a camera crew, DiGiulian summited El Capitan on Wednesday, Nov. 26, after a grueling 23 days \u2014 the first woman to free-climb the ascent on the Platinum route.",
      "\"I came over the edge and tears started to kind of consume me,\" she told CBS News, adding, \"I'm going to remember this climb for the rest of my life.\"",
      "It usually takes climbers multiple days to reach the summit, depending on the route's difficulty. El Capitan draws tens of thousands of climbers each year, according to Yosemite National Park, most taking 5-7 days to summit (on the easier routes, weather conditions permitting) and 60% of climbers typically succeed. Emily Harrington became the first woman to summit the rock formation in under 24 hours via the Golden Gate route in 2021.",
      "DiGiulian has been adventuring since childhood. \"Climbing is this space for me where I get to be really locked in and focused on what my physical and mental self is capable of,\" she said. \"I love puzzle solving.\"",

      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department will seek to dismiss a lawsuit that former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey brought against it, arguing she didn't properly follow administrative complaint procedures before suing.",
      "The government laid out its argument in court papers filed Monday prior to a Thursday hearing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "Comey, a former federal prosecutor in New York who handled criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Trump administration in September over\u00a0her firing\u00a0in July, saying her ouster was \"unlawful and unconstitutional.\" In their\u00a0complaint, Comey's attorneys argued that her termination was \"politically motivated\" and an overreach of presidential authority.",
      "Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has publicly clashed with President Trump for years. In 2017, Mr. Trump\u00a0terminated\u00a0James Comey as FBI director, amid the department's investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia.",
      "James Comey was indicted by a grand jury in September on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. A federal judge last week ordered the criminal charges against him be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed to the role. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "The Justice Department indicated its planned defense to Maurene Comey's lawsuit in a joint letter submitted Monday to Judge Jesse M. Furman by Maurene Comey's lawyers and the chief of the civil division of the federal prosecutor's office in Albany.",
      "The government's sections in the letter argued her lawsuit was not properly before the court because she did not fully comply with administrative procedures requiring the Merit Systems Protection Board to first consider her claim. It rejected her lawsuit's claim that the notice of appeal she filed with the board in August was futile.",
      "The board, the Justice Department maintained in the letter, was \"the appropriate forum to determine whether, as Ms. Comey claims, her removal was a prohibited personnel action or an arbitrary and capricious agency action.\"",
      "Maurene Comey's lawyers said in the filing that the board \"lacks expertise to adjudicate this novel dispute\" and was not an appropriate forum because \"this case raises foundational constitutional questions with respect to the separation of powers.\" They also argued that it was \"no longer true\" that the board functions independently of the president.",
      "A lawyer for Maurene Comey referred CBS News to the letter on Tuesday.",
      "Before her firing in July, Maurene Comey was an assistant U.S. attorney in the high-profile U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, where she had worked since 2015. Her lawyers wrote in their lawsuit that she was fired one day after she had \"been asked to take the lead on a major public corruption case.\" Just months before, she had received an \"outstanding\" review from supervisors, the complaint said.",
      "Last month, U.S. Attorney John Sarcone in Albany took on the case and indicated his office will defend the Trump administration in the lawsuit. The move followed the recusal of prosecutors in Manhattan, where Maurene Comey had secured guilty verdicts in several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell and the bribery convictions of former Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife.",
      "Two weeks before Maurene Comey was fired, a jury convicted Combs of prostitution-related charges, though it acquitted him of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. She led the prosecution team. Combs, 56, is scheduled for release from prison in June 2028.",
      "Maxwell, 63, was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges after a jury found she aided the sex abuse of girls and women by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was found dead in his federal jail cell in August 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking charge. His death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence at a prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred last summer from a prison in Florida.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in the U.S. military's campaign of lethal strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not definitively say when or where any possible land strikes might take place.",
      "Officials have discussed possible military operations in Venezuela in recent weeks, CBS News has previously reported, as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels \u2014 a charge Maduro denies.",
      "But Mr. Trump said Tuesday that land strikes would not necessarily be limited to Venezuela. He said any country where illicit drugs are produced or trafficked \"is subject to attack,\" and singled out neighboring Colombia, which the U.S. has accused of failing to control the drug trade.",
      "The president has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration's sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is \"totally prepared\" to carry out land strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military has built up its presence in the Caribbean, dispatching the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region and sending F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. And over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.",
      "If the president takes the step of ordering strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward\u00a0of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Those boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.",
      "And The Washington Post reported last week that the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to the vessel's wreckage, which some lawmakers and experts argue could constitute a war crime. The White House confirmed there was a second strike, but maintained that the operation was legal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday that any land attack \"would be an act of war, and Congress would invoke the War Powers Act,\" referring to the 1973 law that limits the president's authority to make war without congressional authorization.",
      "Efforts in Congress to limit Mr. Trump's campaign have run into opposition so far. The Senate narrowly\u00a0voted down a resolution last month that would have prevented any strikes against Venezuela without a declaration of war, with 49 senators \u2014 including two Republicans \u2014 voting in support. A month earlier, a vote to end the strikes on alleged drug boats also failed.",
      "Land strikes would also likely face heavy pushback in Latin America. In response to Mr. Trump's comments, Colombian President Gustavo Petro defended his government's anti-narcotics efforts, but warned: \"Do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the jaguar.\"",
      "Venezuelan officials have also accused the Trump administration of intimidating the country and seeking Maduro's ouster. Mr. Trump has not said what his intentions are with Venezuela, but told reporters in mid-November he's \"sort of\" made up his mind on how to proceed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-what-parents-need-to-know/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:48:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The three-dose hepatitis B vaccine has a long track record of safety, but rolling back recommendations could leave kids vulnerable to infections, doctors say.",
    "story": [
      "Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.",
      "One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.",
      "McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.",
      "McMahon can still hear his voice.",
      "\"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'\" he recalled. \"We were all crying.\" The boy died at home a week later.",
      "The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.",
      "That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years.",
      "In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to the number of cases plummeting.",
      "\"Liver cancer has disappeared in children,\" McMahon said. \"We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of.\"",
      "He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.",
      "Pushing back the dose?",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.",
      "On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a \"likely culprit\" of autism.",
      "He also said the hepatitis B virus is not \"casually contagious.\" But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.",
      "The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.",
      "Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's up to states to do that. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Two senior FDA officials \u2014 Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad \u2014 suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.",
      "In internal agency emails obtained by PBS NewsHour and The Washington Post, Prasad questioned the routine practice of \"giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.",
      "\"Sowing distrust\"",
      "If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.",
      "\"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear,\" he said.",
      "President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.",
      "McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.",
      "\"It's a very infectious virus,\" McMahon said. \"That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it.\"",
      "The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.",
      "The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare.",
      "\"We have an incredible safety profile,\" O'Leary said. \"No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar.\"",
      "The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure.",
      "Expert's advice to parents: Talk to a doctor",
      "William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.",
      "His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%.",
      "\"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver,\" Schaffner said. \"It's too late to prevent that infection.\"",
      "He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.",
      "And more hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.",
      "Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile \u2014 for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.",
      "\"The data are so clear about this,\" Schaffner said. \"A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved at least two strikes, according to a Washington Post report. It said that after a first strike left two survivors, a subsequent strike killed them. A U.S. official confirms a total of four missiles were used.",
      "The Post also reported that Hegseth gave a verbal order to \"kill everybody\" in the Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea, though Hegseth has not confirmed this. He told reporters Tuesday that he did not see survivors in the live video he viewed and was not in the room when Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander overseeing the operation, ordered a second strike. Bradley, according to the report, was complying with Hegseth's directive as two survivors clung to the wreckage.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday first confirmed a second strike on the boat was directed by Bradley, who, she said, \"worked well within his authority and the law \u2026 to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat of narco-terrorists to the United States was completely eliminated.\" Hegseth authorized Bradley to conduct the strikes, Leavitt said, though she denied that the defense secretary had given the order to kill them all.",
      "President Trump said Sunday he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike and added that Hegseth had told him \"he did not order the death of those two men.\" Mr. Trump made similar comments on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not have all the information about the second strike.",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "Analysis from The Free Press: Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The Post's report has further fueled debate about whether the U.S. is committing war crimes.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in a letter last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the alleged intentional killing of defenseless survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "Still, a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, the Post reported.",
      "Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that allegedly killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",

      "The death toll in Hong Kong's apartment complex fire climbed to 159 on Wednesday, as six people were arrested on suspicion of deactivating some fire alarms during maintenance work at the housing complex, authorities said.",
      "The youngest person who died in the fire was a 1-year-old baby, police said. The oldest was 97. At least 91 women and 41 men were among the dead, according to Commissioner of Police Joe Chow.",
      "Police said they have completed a search for bodies inside all seven of eight high-rise residential towers ravaged in the fire that first broke out last Wednesday and took until Friday to be extinguished. About 30 people were still reported missing.",
      "\"We have found 159 bodies, of whom 140 were identified on a preliminary basis,\" Chow told reporters at a news conference, describing the information as an \"interim wrap-up\" following the completion of building searches.",
      "Chow said officials would continue to search through piles of fallen bamboo scaffolding to check if remains or bodies were buried there, adding: \"We have not finished our work yet.\"",
      "He also said officers had found \"suspected human bones,\" which needed to undergo forensic testing, in the debris, so the death toll could still rise.",
      "The deadly blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, in the northern suburban district of Tai Po, which was undergoing a monthslong renovation project with buildings covered by bamboo scaffolding and green netting.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body said Tuesday that they had arrested 15 people as authorities probe corruption and negligence in relation to the renovation work. Substandard plastic nylon netting covering scaffoldings erected outside the towers and foam boards installed on windows were found to have aided the fire's rapid spread, authorities said earlier this week.",
      "Chris Tang, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security, said police are investigating the Binzhou Inspection and Testing Center in China, which provided the safety inspection certificate for the construction netting.",
      "Meanwhile, the city will remove all external scaffolding nets from ongoing renovations, Tang said. The materials will need to be tested before they are allowed to be installed again.",
      "In addition to the scaffolding issue, residents and officials have said that some fire alarms in the buildings failed to sound when the fire broke out, though it was not clear how widespread that problem was within the complex.",
      "Police said Wednesday that six people who allegedly deactivated some fire alarms at the housing complex during the renovation works were arrested on suspicion of making false representation to the fire services department.",
      "The initial cause of the fire was still under investigation.",

      "The authors of a study that examined climate change's potential effect on the global economy said Wednesday that data errors led them to slightly overstate an expected drop in income over the next 25 years.",
      "The researchers at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.",
      "The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.",
      "The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.",
      "The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.",
      "Max Kotz, one of the study's authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.",

    "summary": "11 years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished without a trace, a U.S. firm is to resume its hunt for the Boeing 777 in the Indian Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u00a0\u2014 Malaysia's government said Wednesday that American marine robotics company Ocean Infinity would soon resume the seabed search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, more than a decade after the plane vanished over the Indian Ocean.",
      "MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared from air-traffic radar 39 minutes after departing from Kuala Lumpur enroute to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014. The packed passenger jet's disappearance without a trace sparked one of aviation's most baffling mysteries.",
      "Despite years of multinational searches, investigators still do not know exactly what happened to the plane or its 239 passengers and crew.",
      "The Malaysian government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume its search from Dec. 30, about eight months after the last effort was abandoned. Malaysia's transport minister announced in early April that a roughly six-week search by the U.S. firm was ending, saying it wasn't \"the season\" for the work at sea. The minister said at the time that efforts would resume around the end of the year.",
      "The government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume searching intermittently from Dec. 30 for a total of 55 days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft.",
      "Herculean search efforts in the southern Indian Ocean, where the jet is believed to have gone down, have thus far turned up virtually nothing. Apart from a few small fragments that washed ashore, no bodies or large wreckage have ever been recovered.",
      "Below is a look at what we know about the deadly aviation tragedy.",
      "\"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\"",
      "The pilot's last radio call to Kuala Lumpur \u2014 a simple, \"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\" \u2014 was the final communication before the plane crossed into Vietnamese airspace. It never checked in with controllers there.",
      "Minutes later, the plane's transponder, which broadcasts its location, shut down. Military radar showed the jet turn back over the Andaman Sea, and satellite data suggested it continued flying for hours, possibly until fuel exhaustion, before crashing into a remote section of the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Theories about what happened range from hijacking to cabin depressurization or power failure. There was no distress call, ransom demand, evidence of technical failure or severe weather.",
      "Malaysian investigators in 2018 cleared the passengers and crew but did not rule out \"unlawful interference.\" Authorities have said someone deliberately severed communications and diverted the plane.",
      "Who was on MH370 when it vanished?",
      "MH370 carried 227 passengers, including five young children, and 12 crew members. Most passengers were Chinese, but there were also citizens from the United States, Indonesia, France, Russia and elsewhere.",
      "Among those aboard were two young Iranians traveling on stolen passports, a group of Chinese calligraphy artists, 20 employees of U.S. tech firm Freescale Semiconductor, a stunt double for actor Jet Li and several families with young children. Many families lost multiple members.",
      "Largest underwater search in history",
      "Search operations began in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, then expanded to the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Australia, Malaysia and China coordinated the largest underwater search in history, covering roughly 46,000 square miles of seabed off western Australia. Aircraft, vessels equipped with sonar and robotic submarines scoured the ocean for signs of the plane.",
      "Signals thought to be from the plane's black box turned out to be from other sources, and no wreckage was found. The first confirmed debris was a flaperon discovered on R\u00e9union Island in July 2015, with additional fragments later found along the east coast of Africa. The search was suspended in January 2017.",
      "In 2018, U.S. marine robotics company Ocean Infinity resumed the hunt under a \"no find, no fee\" agreement, focusing on areas identified through debris drift studies, but it ended without success.",
      "Challenging search conditions in the Indian Ocean",
      "One reason such an extensive search may have failed to turn up clues is that no one knows exactly where to look. The Indian Ocean is the world's third largest, and the search was conducted in a difficult area, where searchers encountered bad weather and average depths of around 2.5 miles.",
      "It's not common for planes to disappear in the deep sea, but when they do remains can be very hard to locate. Over the past 50 years, dozens of planes have vanished, according to the Aviation Safety Network.",
      "Malaysia's government gave the green light in March for another \"no-find, no-fee\" contract with Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation across a newly identified 5,800-square-mile site in the ocean. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million for its work, but only if wreckage is discovered.",
      "It is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane's location. It has said it would utilize new technology and has worked with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tells reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\"",
      "But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed. He said he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Dec. 2: Hegseth says he didn't watch second strike and didn't see any survivors",
      "During a Cabinet meeting, Hegseth tells reporters he watched the first boat strike on Sept. 2 live, but had \"moved on to my next meeting\" before the boat was hit a second time.",
      "\"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs.\"",
      "He said he later learned that Bradley chose to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat,\" which Hegseth said was the right decision.",
      "Hegseth also said he did not \"personally see survivors\" following the first strike \"because the thing was on fire,\" calling the situation the \"fog of war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know about the second strike\" when asked about his comment over the weekend that he wouldn't have wanted a follow-on attack.",
      "\"To me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" the president said.",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Hegseth defended the administration's strategy of striking vessels, saying, \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\"",

      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",

      "The government of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.",
      "An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquet\u00eda International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.",
      "Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.",
      "Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.",
      "Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.",
      "The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.",
      "\"You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,\" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. \"We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.\"",
      "Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.",
      "Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.",
      "\"Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,\" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: \"Not just Venezuela.\"",
      "Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and\u00a0bipartisan concerns in Congress\u00a0that a\u00a0follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat\u00a0may have constituted a war crime.",
      "As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries,\u00a0Pope Leo XVI\u00a0on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, told reporters aboard the papal plane\u00a0returning from Lebanon\u00a0that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas were trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.",
      "\"The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,\" he said. \"On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.\"",
      "He stressed that he didn't have further information. \"Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure \u2014 including economic pressure \u2014 \u00a0but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.\"",

      "The Trump administration is considering expanding its travel ban \u2014 which currently restricts or bars the entry of nationals from 19 countries \u2014 to around 30 nations in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack in Washington \u2014 which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025 \u2014 to further expand its immigration crackdown. It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",

    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

      "\"They're big concessions,\" he told reporters. \"They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and some of his European supporters have spoken out against this approach, arguing that granting Russia dominion over any currently occupied Ukrainian land would set a dangerous precedent, effectively rewarding Putin for a unilateral, unprovoked invasion.",

    "summary": "U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions after Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel's leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of pounds of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state's capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \"Chapitos,\" as \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons were known. According to a 2023 U.S. indictment, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",
      "On the plane that landed in New Mexico were only the pilot, Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. Aboard the plane, Zambada was given a drink containing sedatives, which Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez also drank a little of, according to Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's account.",
      "Rather than congratulating or thanking the U.S. for arresting the elusive Zambada, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it was studying the possibility of bringing treason charges against Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez or whoever else aided in the plot.",
      "The arrests set off a bloody fight in Sinaloa among their respective cartel factions for control of the business, violence that L\u00f3pez Obrador's successor President Claudia Sheinbaum is still dealing with.",
      "With the plea deal, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's defense attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he is expected to avoid life in prison.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years.",
      "In May, Mexico's security chief confirmed that\u00a017 family members\u00a0of the cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration. El Chapo's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez Perez, and her daughter were among the family members to enter the U.S.,\u00a0local media reported.",

      "Trump backs candidate, claims effort to \"change the results\"",
      "Days before the vote, former Tegucigalpa mayor Asfura won Mr. Trump's backing \u2014 as the U.S. president sought to put his finger on the scale of another Latin American election.",
      "In a Monday post on his own Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump accused the Honduran electoral body of \"trying to change the results\" of the vote, adding: \"If they do, there will be hell to pay!\"",
      "He claimed that the CNE had \"abruptly stopped counting\" ballots on the night of the election when the initial count \"showed a close race between\" Asfura and Nasralla, noting the slight lead that tally showed for Asfura.",
      "\"It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes. Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans must have their Votes counted,\" he said in the post, which he published before the CNE chief urged patience for a manual count.",

      "Ally Javier Milei came out on top in Argentina's mid-term elections, but it is not yet clear if Mr. Trump's endorsement will be enough to secure victory for Asfura, whose campaign slogan was: \"Grandad, at your service!\"",
      "Could Trump help swing Honduras back to the right?",
      "The election is a clear defeat for ruling leftists trailing far behind in the vote count. A swing to the right could help build U.S. influence in a country that under leftist government had looked increasingly to China.",
      "The election campaign was dominated by Mr. Trump's threat and the surprise announcement that he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez of Asfura's National Party.",
      "Hernandez, who has always maintained his innocence, is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States, where he was convicted of belonging to one of \"the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world.\"",

      "Some Hondurans have welcomed Mr. Trump's intervention, saying they hope it means migrants will be allowed to remain in the U.S.",
      "Many Hondurans have fled north to escape grinding poverty and violence, including minors fearing forced recruitment by gangs.",
      "This escape route has been made more difficult by Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, and nearly 30,000 Honduran migrants have been deported from the U.S. since his second term started in January.",
      "The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country of 11 million people, where money sent home from abroad accounted for 27% of GDP last year.",
      "Others reject what they see as meddling by Mr. Trump.",

The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2.

      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",
      "The JAG group called on Congress to probe any use of the military involving \"the intentional targeting of anyone \u2013 enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians \u2013 rendered hors de combat (\"out of the fight\") as a result of their wounds or the destruction of the ship or aircraft carrying them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also asked Monday evening about whether he has confidence in Hegseth and about the boat strike.",

      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster.

      "The meeting comes after U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida over the weekend. Witkoff has met with Putin before, as he has turned his focus toward Ukraine after he and Kushner helped broker the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The U.S. backed a peace proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine last month, although much more work remains to be done. Putin has called U.S. proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement. Last week, Mr. Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" after a U.S. official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend that the U.S.-backed plan, which was originally 28 points, has evolved, after some alleged it was heavily slanted toward Russia's priorities, with one provision calling for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Those two things aren't going to be seen as concessions to European leaders, who believe Russia should give back Ukrainian territory it has occupied. Ukraine has also pushed for security guarantees as part of any deal to end the war, though Russia has rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, which would obligate the U.S. and other member states to come to its defense.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Florida for the talks with the Ukrainians over the weekend, called the conversations with the Ukrainians \"another very productive session\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever,\" he said. \"So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity. It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.\"",
      "On Sunday, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio voiced concerns that the White House approach could be too pro-Russia.",
      "Asked by CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "Peace is far from a reality on the ground in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down again on Kyiv over the weekend, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from western Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered high praise for Witkoff's negotiating skills and personable nature, and given him an increasingly large portfolio. The White House did not dispute a phone transcript published by Bloomberg last week in which Witkoff reportedly advised Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, on how Putin should approach Mr. Trump in peace negotiations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-alleged-drug-boat-strike-venezuela-hegseth/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the commander of a September operation \"worked well within his authority and the law\" when ordering a follow-on strike.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "At another point, CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked Leavitt: \"So was the initial order from Secretary Hegseth, 'everyone be killed,' and did that come from President Trump?\"",
      "\"I saw that quoted in a Washington Post story. I would reject that the secretary of war ever said that,\" Leavitt said. \"However, the president has made it quite clear that if narcoterrorists, again, are trafficking illegal drugs towards the United States, he has the authority to kill them. And that's what this administration is doing.\"",
      "Later on Monday, Hegseth wrote on social media that Bradley is \"an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support.\"",
      "\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since,\" Hegseth said.",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who served in the role from 2011-2013 under former President Barack Obama, said on \"CBS Evening News\" Monday that the reported second strike constitutes a war crime \"because these individuals were injured. They were in the water.\"",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them,\" Panetta said. \"You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try protect their lives at that point. And that the concern right now whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "On Monday, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

      "A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin \"El Chapo\" pleaded guilty Monday to U.S. drug trafficking charges, months after his brother entered a plea deal.",
      "Known locally in Mexico as the \"Chapitos,\" or \"little Chapos,\" Joaquin Guzman Lopez and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are accused of running a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. Federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send \"staggering\" quantities of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Joaquin Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise.",
      "He and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U.S. on a private plane. Both men have previously pleaded not guilty to various drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.",
      "As part of the plea deal, Joaquin Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.",

      "\"The government has been very fair with Joaquin thus far,\" he told reporters after the court hearing. \"I do appreciate the fact that the Mexican government didn't interfere.\"",
      "In July, Ovidio Guzman Lopez became the first son of drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to enter a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Legal experts called the plea deal a significant step for the U.S. government in their investigation and prosecution of Sinaloa cartel leaders.",
      "Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the U.S. over 25 years.

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",

      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",

      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",

    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization issued new guidelines Monday recommending the use of GLP-1 drugs for treating obesity.",
      "In the\u00a0new guidelines, the United Nations health agency made two key recommendations \u2014 first, that GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults for long-term treatment of obesity, except for pregnant women. It also recommended intensive behavioral therapy, including changes related to diet and exercise, alongside the use of the medications.",
      "\"Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom\u00a0 Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a news release. \"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"",
      "Both recommendations, however, are considered \"conditional.\" WHO noted that the first recommendation is considered \"conditional\" due to limited data on the medications' long-term efficacy and safety, as well as costs and other factors. The second recommendation was graded \"conditional\" based on \"low-certainty evidence\" that intensive behavioral therapy enhances GLP-1  treatment outcomes.",
      "Still, the organization calls the drugs \"more than a scientific breakthrough.\"",
      "\"They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity-from a 'lifestyle condition' to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease,\" says an article published online Monday in the peer-reviewed medical journal  JAMA. The article was co-written by Francesca Celletti, who is senior advisor for obesity at WHO's Nutrition and Food Safety department.",
      "The World Health Organization highlighted the importance of equitable access to GLP-1 drugs, saying that it is calling for \"urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.\"",
      "\"Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030,\" WHO says.",
      "Well-known brand names of GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. include Ozempic and Mounjaro, which are FDA approved for treating diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound, which are approved for weight loss.",
      "WHO estimates that obesity affects more than 1 billion people globally and was associated with 3.7 million deaths last year. It also notes that in September, it added GLP-1 therapies to its \"Essential Medicines List\" for managing type 2 diabetes in groups that are high-risk.",

    "story": [
      "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
      "The publisher for the Oxford English Dictionary said on Monday it chose \"rage bait\" as its top word for the year, capturing the internet zeitgeist of 2025.",
      "The word of the year is selected by lexicographers at Oxford University Press who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "What is \"rage bait\"?",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The person producing it will bask in the millions, quite often, of comments and shares and even likes sometimes,'' lexicographer Susie Dent told CBS News partner BBC. This is a result of the algorithms used by social media companies, \"because although we love fluffy cats, we'll appreciate that we tend to engage more with negative content and content that really provokes us.\"",
      "It is similar to clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader into viewing an article or a video, but rage bait content's specific focus is on making people angry.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",
      "2025 Word of the Year shortlist",
      "Rage bait topped two other contenders \u2013 \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" \u2013 after public comment on a shortlist compiled by the publisher's lexicographers.",
      "\"Aura farming'' means to cultivate a public image by presenting oneself in \"a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique.''",
      "\"Biohack'' is defined as \"an attempt to improve or optimize one's physical or mental performance, health or longevity.''",
      "Oxford's past winners",
      "Oxford University Press has selected a word of the year annually since 2004.",
      "Past winners include \"podcast\" in 2005, \"emoji\" in 2015, and in 2022, \"goblin mode,\" which described people who resisted returning to normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Last year's word, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary declared \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year, defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",

      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",

      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",

      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",

      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

      "4. Not knowing your triggers",
      "Some foods and drinks are more likely to cause trouble. Common triggers include fatty or fried dishes, tomato sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, according to the doctor.",

    "summary": "The Biden Department of Justice would not have notified Judge Boasberg that its subpoenas of phone records pertained to Congress members, a court official said.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, shares the latest on the alleged FBI probe of President Donald Trump's allies.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: A top federal court official defended Judge James Boasberg\u2019s gag orders that hid subpoenas related to the FBI's Arctic Frost investigation, saying this week that the chief judge in Washington would likely have been unaware that the subpoenas' intended targets were members of Congress.",
      "The administrative office for the federal courts indicated that the chief judge in D.C. routinely blindly signed gag orders when the Department of Justice requested them, including during Arctic Frost, the investigation that led to former special counsel Jack Smith bringing election charges against President Donald Trump.",
      "The administrative office's director, Robert Conrad Jr., provided the explanation on behalf of Boasberg to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital.",
      "REPUBLICANS FEUD OVER 'ARCTIC FROST' ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE, BUT CRITICS OFFER NO CLEAR ALTERNATIVE",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley speaks at a press conference on the Arctic Frost probe with other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Oct. 29, 2025. (Annabelle Gordon/Reuters)",
      "The letter came in response to Grassley, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, demanding an explanation from Boasberg about why he authorized the one-year gag orders, which barred phone companies from telling Republican Congress members that their records were subpoenaed by Smith in 2023.",
      "Conrad said he could not address those specific subpoenas and gag orders, in part because some of the material was sealed, but that he could help the lawmakers \"understand relevant practices\" in place during Arctic Frost.",
      "The DOJ\u2019s requests for gag orders, also known as non-disclosure orders, \"typically do not attach the related subpoena; rather they identify the subject accounts only by a signifier \u2014 e.g., a phone number,\" Conrad wrote. \"As a result, [non-disclosure order] applications would not reveal whether a particular phone number belonged to a member of Congress.\"",
      "Grassley reacted to the latest correspondence from the court by faulting the Biden DOJ for seeking the gag orders from Boasberg without notifying the judge that they pertained to Congress members.",
      "Grassley noted that the DOJ's Public Integrity Section gave Smith's team the green light to subpoena lawmakers' phone records but had also told the prosecutors to be wary of concerns lawmakers could raise about the Constitution's speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members added protections in prosecutorial matters.",
      "\"Smith went ahead with the congressional subpoenas anyway, and it appears he and his team didn\u2019t apprise the court of member involvement,\" Grassley told Fox News Digital. \"Smith\u2019s apparent lack of candor is deeply troubling, and he needs to answer for his conduct.\"",
      "The DOJ revised its policy in response to an inspector general report in 2024 so that prosecutors were required to notify the court if they were seeking a gag order against a Congress member so that judges could take that into consideration when deciding whether to authorize the orders. Smith's subpoenas pre-dated that policy shift.",
      "The subpoenas, and the gag orders that kept them concealed, have drawn enormous criticism from the targeted lawmakers, who alleged that the Biden DOJ improperly spied on them over their alleged involvement in attempting to overturn the 2020 election and that Boasberg was complicit in allowing it. Among the top critics is Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was set to lead a since-postponed hearing Wednesday examining the case for impeaching Boasberg. Impeachment of judges is exceedingly rare and typically has only occurred in response to crimes like corruption and bribery.",

      "Johnson said he remained unsatisfied with Boasberg after the letter from the administrative office.",
      "\"Judge Boasberg\u2019s refusal to answer questions from Congress about his approval of unlawful gag orders is an affront to transparency and an obvious attempt to deflect any responsibility for his awareness of or involvement in Jack Smith\u2019s partisan dragnet,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital. \"Judge Boasberg must immediately lift the seal that is apparently preventing him from addressing Congress\u2019 questions and provide the public a full explanation for his actions.\"",

The records did not include the contents of calls and messages. Smith has defended the subpoenas, saying they were in line with department policy and \"entirely proper.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of conservative groups representing the energy industry is hailing a list of 10 regulatory and fiscal \"wins\" under the Trump administration's new Energy Secretary Chris Wright, which they say have \"restored America's path toward true energy dominance.\"",
      "\"Secretary Chris Wright has delivered the boldest course correction in modern energy policy, and the results speak for themselves. He has led the largest deregulatory initiative in Department of Energy history, cut billions in wasteful green subsidies, and restored a clear path to American energy dominance,\" Jason Isaac, CEO of one of the groups that signed on to the published list of Trump administration energy sector wins, wrote.",
      "\"He halted dozens of harmful appliance rules, streamlined NEPA, canceled politically driven wind, solar, and carbon-capture spending, reignited U.S. LNG and nuclear development, and used emergency authority to keep critical coal capacity online, so the grid stays stable when it matters most,\" he continued. \"This is what it looks like when Washington finally puts consumers, reliability, and American workers first.\"",

      "Vice President JD Vance, left, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, right, in Greenland while honoring the 55th anniversary of Earth Day 2025. (Reuters)",
      "Groups from the letter include the Heartland Institute, the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, Truth In Energy and Climate, the American Energy Institute and others.",
      "Several of the \"wins\" they touted focused on deregulation, such as the rescission or blocking of 47 specific regulations and standards for a variety of consumer appliances, reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) aimed at reducing permitting delays for energy infrastructure, the cancellation of \"billions of dollars\" in funding for wind and solar projects, the fast-tracking of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects that the coalition says were \"stymied\" under the Biden administration and an initiative to critically review the impact of greenhouse gasses on the U.S. climate, among a list of other reforms.",
      "However, environmental groups who spoke to Fox News Digital about the conservative coalition's victory lap argued the recent reforms actually serve to help big businesses and not the average person. They noted that the viewpoint that President Donald Trump's environmental agenda is making the country stronger is also a facade.",
      "\"These policies might be good for Trump and Wright's rich corporate buddies, but they are downright evil for working people,\" Tim Donaghy, Greenpeace USA's research director, told Fox News Digital. \"The decisions made\u00a0in the last nine months are literally sucking money out of Americans' wallets and putting it into oil industry bank accounts, while pretending they're making the country stronger.\"",
      "Donaghy said that President Trump's plan to increase energy exports, for example, \"will increase\" costs for American families and exacerbate climate change, which he argued was another driver of increased housing insurance costs for families.",
      "CCP-LINKED FIRMS QUIETLY HOLD STAKES IN US SOLAR COMPANIES FUELING DEM'S GREEN PUSH",
      "\"The sad thing is that the Trump\u00a0administration's policies are creating more pollution that will make Americans sick. Every year, 350,000 Americans die younger from being exposed to toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels. We need that number to go down. These \u2018wins\u2019 all but guarantee it will go up,\" Donaghy concluded.",
      "The \"wins\" touted by the \"American Energy Dominance Coalition\" did not exclusively include deregulation efforts in the energy sector, but also featured increased investments in nuclear energy production. The list also praised Secretary Wright for launching a critical review earlier this summer looking into the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the U.S. climate, as well as a study focused on identifying pipeline needs and potential permitting reforms that could be used to help speed up oil and gas production.",
      "Some of the additional deregulation \"wins\" listed by the coalition include the termination of $3.7 billion in carbon-capture and decarbonization grants, the cancellation of \"hundreds-of-millions\" in electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing grants and a push towards rescinding energy-efficiency standards for federal billions, which the conservative coalition argued could lead to saving millions of dollars in \"unnecessary upgrades.\"",
      "\"Chris Wright has done an amazing job of actually prioritizing American energy development and affordability rather than globalist misguided climate agendas,\" Heartland Institute President James Taylor said. \"American energy policy must continue to bolster affordable and reliable domestic energy sources rather than the agendas of foreign nations that are often hostile to American interests.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sal Nuzzo, executive director of Consumers Defense, also praised Secretary Wright and his administration's \"most sweeping de-regulatory initiative in U.S. history,\" for overturning \"burdensome regulations\" that Nuzzo says hurt both consumers and businesses.",
      "Nuzzo also pointed out that the Trump administration has taken a stand against \"politically motivated\" environmental, social, governance (ESG) \"schemes,\" which he said have been inflating energy costs and weakening U.S. independence while also undermining the free market system.",
      "But the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Bernadette Del Chiaro, who is EWG's senior vice president for its California-based operations, dismissed that the policy \"wins\" touted by these conservative groups were actually \"wins\" for the American people. Instead, Del Chiaro described them as \"giveaways\" to the fossil fuel industry that will result in greater pollution, higher energy costs, and fewer choices for consumers.",

These rollbacks kill jobs, strand private investment, and hand global economic advantage to China just as the rest of the world races toward cheaper, cleaner and more competitive energy sources,\" Del Chiaro told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If the priority is affordability, the Administration is on the wrong track as there\u2019s no cheaper energy resource than solar,\" she added. \"And if beefing up American energy independence is the goal, once again, we are veering off course because there is nothing more abundant than the sunshine that falls on our country \u2018from sea to shining sea,\u2019 or more homegrown than the wind that whips across our Great Plains.\""

      "Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian discusses the impact of U.S. elite\u2019s rejection of assimilation in immigration.",
      "An expert warned that the U.S. immigration crisis in America will continue so long as the country\u2019s elite reject the idea of the \"Americanization\" of immigrants.",
      "Mark Krikorian, who is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital during an interview that one of the core drivers of declining assimilation in America is not only mass immigration itself but an ongoing \"identity problem\" in which the country\u2019s elite have made assimilation a \"dirty word\" by rejecting American identity and exceptionalism.",
      "\"It's not the immigrants\u2019 doing, it's a problem we have where our leadership classes, whether it's government, business, education, religion, everything, aren't really sure about whether it is even a good thing to be an American,\" Krikorian, one of the country\u2019s most notorious authorities on immigration policy, continued.",
      "\"The idea basically here is that there is no meaning to nationhood or to peoplehood that living in the United States is kind of like living in Northern New Jersey as opposed to Southern New Jersey. You live in the United States, or you live in Mexico or you live in Swaziland, it doesn't mean anything,\" he explained.",

      "Like those in New York, Massachusetts' local communities have been stressed by the sheer number of migrants placed in their state. (David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)",
      "\"The left increasingly, even at the mainstream level, they see immigration law itself as a kind of Jim Crow, that it's immoral to keep anyone from moving to the United States if they want to. And everything stems from that,\" he continued. \"Because if that's your worldview, then obviously law enforcement coming to round up and remove people who have no right to be here, no legal right to be here, is immoral.\"",
      "\"So, in that context, how could we expect immigrants to Americanize successfully?\" Krikorian said, adding,\"What's different today from, say, 100 or 200 years ago, is we now have a leadership class that doesn't even believe in assimilation. They think Americanization is a dirty word.\"",
      "\"My mother was a daughter of immigrants, went to public school in the 30s and 40s outside Boston, and she was taught to memorize the Gettysburg Address and George Washington was the father of our country and they sang Hail Columbia in school. You think they're doing that in the L.A. Unified School District now, or in New York, or in the school district outside of Boston my mother went to? No!\" he said. \"They teach American kids to, at best, be ambivalent about America, depending on the school district, even hate America.\"",
      "\"Until that changes,\" he went on, \"admitting large numbers of people, even legally, is frankly a bad idea.\"",
      "President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have embarked on an intensive immigration enforcement agenda. With over 515,000 illegal aliens deported since Trump took office in January, the administration is on track to significantly exceed the record number of illegals deported out of the United States.",
      "However, Krikorian warned that deportations will not be a complete solution to the problem.",
      "\"We now have the largest percentage of our population foreign-born ever recorded in American history. It's close to 16% now. That's more than it was during even the Ellis Island era \u2026 we've never been here before,\" Krikorian said.",

      "Anti-ICE rioters and police face-off in Los Angeles on Saturday, June 14, 2025.\u00a0 (Jamie Vera/Fox News)",
      "This is further coupled with the rise of technology, which Krikorian said makes it less important for immigrants to integrate into their new communities.",
      "\"Newcomers don't have to really cut off ties in the way that they had to do in the past,\" he said. \"In the old days, immigrating meant you had no choice but to reorient your emotional and psychological attachments to the new country \u2026 Nowadays, you can FaceTime home every day. You can hop on a plane and go to your cousin's wedding in Bogota for a three-day weekend.\"",
      "The solution, in Krikorian\u2019s estimation, is U.S. leaders, from the president to schoolteachers, embracing American identity. With the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence coming in 2026, Krikorian said there is a \"real opportunity\" for \"a whole year-long process of starting to change the narrative and have that narrative percolate down to local institutions, individual schools, individual congregations, individual businesses, and kind of reverse this idea that America stinks and you shouldn't want to become part of it.\"",

      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Attackers often tailor phishing messages using information they find about you. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for them to craft emails that feel convincing. You can use personal data removal services to clean up exposed details and old database leaks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",

      "Phishing attacks are changing fast, and tricks like invisible characters show how creative attackers are getting. It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

He described the full experience in a detailed post on Medium, where he walked through the scam step by step.",

      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",

      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",

      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",

FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",

      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",

      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

      "Many people assume younger adults understand digital safety. They grew up with phones and social media. Research shows that this assumption is wrong.",
      "NordPass found that an 18-year-old often picks the same weak password patterns as an 80-year-old. Younger users favor long number sequences. Older users lean toward names. Neither group creates secure or random strings. Generations Z and Y tend to avoid names. Generations X and older use them often. Each approach carries risk because attackers expect both patterns.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "How the malware infiltrates devices",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",
      "System updates often patch security issues that attackers exploit to bypass protections. Updating your apps is just as important, since outdated versions may contain weaknesses. Turn on automatic updates so that your device stays protected without you having to check manually.",
      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes. If one password gets exposed, the rest of your accounts remain safe.",

It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

The FDA has approved its first human trial built to test whether its fully implantable device can restore speech for people with paralysis. This milestone gives the Austin company a strong position in a competitive space, shaping the future of neural technology.",
      "Paradromics received Investigational Device Exemption status for the Connect-One Early Feasibility Study using its Connexus BCI.

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

      "Lai Ching-te, president of Taiwan, viewed tank drills using U.S.-made equipment, Thursday, July 10, 2025. (Associated Press)",
      "KAOHSIUNG: Last week, Taiwan President William Lai unveiled a massive $40 billion supplemental defense procurement proposal, casting it as proof that the independently ruled, democratic island is serious about countering escalating military pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The PRC has not governed Taiwan for even a single day but claims it as its territory.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that, \"We welcome Taiwan\u2019s announcement of a new $40 billion special defense procurement budget. Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and more than 45 years of commitment across multiple U.S. Administrations, the United States supports Taiwan\u2019s acquisition of critical defense capabilities, commensurate with the threat it faces.\"",
      "The spokesperson also commended Taipei, saying, \"We also welcome the Lai administration\u2019s recent commitments to increase defense spending to at least 3% of GDP by 2026 and 5% of GDP by 2030, which demonstrates resolve to strengthen Taiwan\u2019s self-defense capabilities.\"",

      "The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) \u2013 the de facto American embassy \u2013 responded very positively almost immediately after Lai\u2019s proposal was announced. Courtney Donovan Smith, a political columnist for the Taipei Times, told Fox News Digital that the strong support from AIT, \"Amounts to a public American stamp of approval.\"",
      "A day after Lai\u2019s announcement, Taiwan Defense Minister Wellington Koo told the media that preliminary talks have already been held with the United States about the kinds of weapons it wants to buy as part of this budget that would run from 2026 to 2033. But Koo said he could not make any details of discussions public until Congress receives a formal notification.",
      "Yet some in Taiwan expressed concern that the language from the administration was somewhat understated, and didn\u2019t come from senior-enough officials.",
      "Those worried about what they perceive as a muted tone from the Trump administration wondered if the timing could be sensitive, coming shortly after President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a trade deal, and just days after Xi phoned Trump to reiterate Beijing\u2019s claims over Taiwan, claims the U.S. \"acknowledges\" but does not accept.",
      "Even so, Taipei-based political risk analyst and Tamkang University assistant professor Ross Feingold told Fox News Digital that U.S. support fundamentally has not shifted and that when it comes to U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan, \"If Taiwan is a willing buyer, the Trump administration is likely to be a willing seller.\"",

      "Also causing distress to the fragile egos of China\u2019s communist leaders is Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a conservative who became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister in October. She appeared to break long-standing Japanese strategic ambiguity over Taiwan when, asked on Nov. 7 in parliament whether a Chinese attack on Taiwan would qualify as \"a situation threatening Japan\u2019s survival.\"",
      "Takaichi didn\u2019t deflect with a \"I don\u2019t comment on hypotheticals.\" Instead, she said, \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\"",
      "Under Japan\u2019s 2015 security law, that designation could allow Japanese military action in defense of an ally.",

      "China predictably lashed out, immediately calling her remarks \"egregious.\" A Chinese diplomat in Osaka escalated further, reposting coverage on X with a threat-like warning: \"The dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off.\"",
      "Kerry K. Gershaneck, a visiting scholar at National Chengchi University and a former U.S. Marine counterintelligence officer, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. needed to clearly denounce China for threats against Japan and the Japanese prime minister. Gershaneck warned that Asian allies remember past U.S. abandonment under what he called the \"do not provoke China!\" policy of the Obama administration. \"Unless high-level Washington officials signal stronger support,\" he said, \"the Trump 47 administration risks going down in history as Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s third term.\"",
      "Feingold noted that while Takaichi\u2019s stance was enthusiastically received in Taiwan, the excitement \"was unsustainable and not based on a formal policy decision by Japan to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "Following reports that President Trump phoned the Japanese prime minister and requested that she dial down talk about Taiwan, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Kihara Minoru issued a strong denial, saying Trump did not advise Takaichi to \"temper the tone of her comments about Taiwan.\"",

      "While the geopolitical shifts grabbed headlines, Lai\u2019s real challenge is domestic. Taiwan has a single-chamber legislature, and Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party does not have a majority.",
      "Cheng Li-wun, the new chair of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), campaigned against boosting defense spending to 5% of GDP and has repeatedly argued Taiwan is \"not an ATM\" for \"unreasonable\" military budgets. The KMT supports renewed engagement with Beijing and acceptance of the \"1992 Consensus,\" a proposed framework that allows both sides to claim there is \"one China\" while interpreting the meaning differently. Lai rejects that position entirely, calling it a path toward subordination to China.",

      "Bryce Barros, associate fellow at GLOBSEC and a former U.S. Senate national security advisor, told Fox News Digital that there are serious hurdles. \"Opposition leaders have cited cuts to other essential services like healthcare, lack of details on how the budget will be paid for and concerns over more hostilities with China,\" he said. But Barros said the head of the de facto American embassy has called for bipartisan support for the bill, and he noted Lai needs only six opposition defections for the vote to pass.",
      "Analysts also stress the proposal is not solely for U.S. weapons. Lai wants major investment in domestic defense manufacturing, including a \"dome\" anti-missile system, which could help blunt accusations of excessive spending to curry favor with Washington. But the plan still faces a volatile parliament and certain retaliation from China.",

      "A group of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to vote on whether the agency should scrap its long-standing recommendation that every baby get a hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth.",
      "The shot \u2014 universally recommended for newborns in the U.S since the early 1990s \u2014 is credited with driving down cases of acute hepatitis B infections in kids by 99%. The virus, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure.",
      "Despite its success, the hepatitis B vaccine has become the latest target of skeptics who question whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential risks.",
      "A vaccine given on \u201cday one has a risk of neonatal fever, which causes more interventions\u201d like blood work to determine the cause of the fever, said Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who practices at Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.",
      "Milhoan has been a member of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since June, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all of its members, replacing them with his own appointees. On Monday, Milhoan was named the new ACIP chair, replacing Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician who previously cast doubt on childhood vaccines, including the one for hepatitis B.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he has never seen a serious reaction after \u201cthousands of babies\u201d have been given the hepatitis B vaccine.",
      "\u201cI never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at a media briefing Tuesday.",
      "And a review of more than 400 studies found no evidence that the birth dose of the vaccines causes any short- or long-term health problems. On the contrary, the review of research, published Tuesday by the Vaccine Integrity Project, an independent group of experts led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, found that giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine has prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations. The paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday. The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director, who can then choose whether to adopt them. While a vote against newborn vaccination does not prohibit doctors from administering the shot, the panel\u2019s recommendations influence insurance coverage.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the ACIP members would vote to eliminate or delay that first dose of a hepatitis B vaccine by a month or two. The agenda posted online as of Tuesday described the meeting in broad strokes, offering no details about who would be presenting data. A vote on the vaccine was supposed to take place at an ACIP meeting in September, but it was tabled because of confusion among committee members.",
      "Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and sharing drug paraphernalia, such as needles. It can also pass from person to person if they share common household items such as toothbrushes or razors.",
      "Milhoan said any decision to give newborns hepatitis B vaccines should be made based on clinicians\u2019 individual assessments of the babies\u2019 risk for infection \u2014 that is, whether a pregnant woman tests positive for the infection or has a \u201cquestionable infectious disease background.\u201d At September\u2019s ACIP meeting, the panel voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.",
      "But not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and if they do, not all feel comfortable speaking frankly with their doctors.",
      "Milhoan appeared to dismiss the argument that women may not divulge activities that could increase their risk for hepatitis B because of stigma.",
      "\u201cI hope they love their baby more than they love their pride,\u201d he said.",
      "A 2019 report showed that just 84% to 88% of pregnant women are tested for the virus. Without vaccination, 90% of babies exposed to the hepatitis B virus during birth develop chronic hepatitis, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The hepatitis B vaccine is not the only immunization Milhoan has cast doubt on. He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance \u2014 formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance \u2014 a group that has advocated for unproven treatments for Covid. His biography on the IMA\u2019s website says he \u201cis dedicated to treating patients affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, Long Covid, and vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.\u201d Last year, he participated in an event with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., about alleged injuries associated with the shots.",
      "Milhoan has been especially critical of Covid vaccines for their link to a small but increased risk of a heart condition called myocarditis in young men. The link was not seen in clinical trials; it was detected in 2021, soon after the shots were made available.",
      "\u201cThe rates of myocarditis were much higher than anyone thought,\u201d Milhoan said. He said he was labeled an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d for speaking out about the potential risk.",
      "\u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Are you against the vaccines?\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to show you what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said.",
      "Over the weekend, Dr. Vinay Prasad, the vaccine chief at the Food and Drug Administration, told staff members in a memo that an internal review found that at least 10 children died \u201cafter and because of\u201d Covid vaccines and suggested the deaths were tied to myocarditis. Prasad did not provide any evidence to back up the claim.",
      "Studies have shown that myocarditis is more commonly associated with Covid infection than vaccination.",
      "This week\u2019s ACIP meeting is also expected to include discussion of the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. The ingredient is added to prompt the immune system to react better to vaccines. A study of more than 1 million people, published over the summer, found that aluminum adjuvants were not linked to an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "The meeting follows months of upheaval within the CDC, including mass firings and significant changes to its messaging. On Nov. 19, a CDC webpage that once stated unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism was rewritten to suggest, without evidence, that health officials had \u201cignored\u201d possible links between the shots and the disorder."

      "A Justice Department representative declined to comment.",
      "Former prosecutors and legal experts told NBC News that bringing fresh cases might be a cleaner path to pursuing the matter, although both cases will continue to face significant challenges, including arguments that they represent selective and vindictive prosecutions. The five-year statute of limitations on Comey's 2020 testimony before Congress \u2014 the basis for his September indictment \u2014 has now expired, but a provision of federal law gives prosecutors an extra six months to secure an indictment after it is dismissed in some circumstances.",
      "Even if the Justice Department persuades another federal grand jury to indict Comey, a core issue will be whether there was an initial indictment, given that a judge found that Halligan \u2014 who took the unusual step of obtaining the indictment on her own \u2014 was unlawfully appointed. Time is less essential in James\u2019 case over an alleged mortgage-related issue, as the statute of limitations most likely wouldn\u2019t expire until at least March.",

      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

      "After four years of dating, the couple recently got engaged, as confirmed by The New York Times.",
      "Cyrus, 33, showed off her engagement ring at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" while posing on the red carpet with Morando, a 27-year-old music producer and drummer for the band Liily.",
      "TODAY.com has also reached out to Cyrus for comment on her engagement and details about her ring.",
      "The ring appears to be a cushion-cut diamond between four and five carats, according to jewelry experts TODAY.com interviewed.",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, says cushion-cut diamonds have a \u201cromantic, vintage feel\u201d and are known for \u201csoft corners and broad facets that catch the light with flashes rather than sparkle.\u201d",
      "It's set in a chunky gold design, which Taylor says has been \"making a return\" among celebrities \u2013\u00a0see: Dua Lipa's recent engagement ring.",
      "The diamond is surrounded by gold, rather than set in prongs, also known as a bezel-style setting.",
      "\"Not only does this keep the stone more secure, but it also helps it stand out even more,\u201d Taylor notes.",
      "The pairing of a classic cushion-cut diamond with the bezel setting gives it a \"modern, sculptural look,\" which suits Cyrus' style, Taylor says.",
      "The ring aligns with Cyrus' brand and sense of style for other reasons, jewelers say.",
      "Ashleigh Bergman, the founder of Milestones by Ashleigh Bergman, says while the setting is classic, it's not \"classically bridal\" \u2014\u00a0which \"conversely makes it super modern.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s edgy (for bridal), but clean,\" she says.",
      "Page Neal, co-founder of Bario Neal, calls the ring \"modern, unfussy, bold, and deeply self-assured.\"",
      "\u201cIt has the feeling of a piece chosen for the present moment in her life, not an echo of the past,\u201d Neal says.",
      "Neal sees the ring speaking to various trends within the jewelry space, including a shift toward elongated shapes like ovals and marquises; east-west settings and the rise of low, wearable profiles.",
      "Jewelers who spoke to TODAY.com estimate the ring costing between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on factors like provenance of the stone, color, clarity and carat size.",
      "While speaking with People, Cyrus offered the following thoughts on her engagement.",
      "\u201cThe detail that I can share is that for us, our privacy and us kind of keeping it small has been something that I\u2019ve been astounded that I\u2019ve actually been able to have and being able to kind of have more choice,\u201d she says.",
      "Cyrus also explained why she thinks she and Morando have mostly been able to avoid the spotlight, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s also being older, being more protective of what I\u2019m open to sharing.\u201d"

      "On Nov. 29, Grande posted an Instagram story that featured a clip from a December 2024 interview with co-star Cynthia Erivo, calling it a \"loving reminder to all.\"",
      "The resurfaced clip comes amid conversation online about the appearance of several members of the \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast.",
      "During the interview with journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga, known professionally as Sally, Grande was asked about how she copes with societal beauty standards and critics.",
      "The singer took the opportunity to address commentary about her appearance and defend herself, noting she\u2019d been part of the discourse since she was a teenager in the public eye.",
      "Grande posted the video Saturday and captioned it, \u201cre-sharing this from last year as a loving reminder to all. I always love and appreciate our talks so much @sally !!!\u201d",
      "In the full clip, the interviewer pointed out that Glinda, Grande\u2019s character in \u201cWicked,\u201d subscribes to beauty standards both for herself, but also to please others. When asked how she navigates beauty expectations and the pressure to look perfect, Grande appeared emotional, calling it a \u201cgood question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of doing this in front of the public and a specimen in a petri dish really since I was 16 or 17,\u201d she explained. \u201cI have heard it all. I\u2019ve heard every version of it, of what\u2019s wrong with me. And then you fix it, and then it\u2019s wrong for different reasons.\u201d",
      "Grande said that she would be picked apart for \u201ceven just the simplest thing,\u201d including her appearance. She also reflected on hearing those comments at a young age, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to protect yourself from that noise.\u201d",
      "However, Grande also noted that the criticism is \u201csomething that is uncomfortable no matter what scale you\u2019re experiencing it on,\u201d whether it's directed at a celebrity or not.",
      "\u201cEven if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone\u2019s Granny says, \u2018Oh my god, you look skinnier! What happened?\u2019 or \u2018You look heavier, what happened?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it\u2019s happening.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous,\u201d Grande said. \u201cI think that I\u2019m really lucky to have the support system that I have to just know and trust that I\u2019m beautiful. But I do know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It\u2019s been a resident in my life since I was 17 and I just don\u2019t invite it in anymore. It\u2019s not welcome.\u201d",
      "Grande also offered advice to those experiencing a similar situation, adding, \u201cAnd however you all can protect yourself from that noise, whether it\u2019s at a family reunion or online, if you have to block people, I don\u2019t care. If you delete the app entirely. You keep yourself safe because no one has the right to say s---.\u201d",

      "The Prime Video German teen drama is beloved for its soapy plots, angsty relationship dynamics and powerful chemistry between leads James Beaufort (Damian Hardung) and Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten).",
      "But their enemies-to-lovers romance has brought plenty of strife to their lives due to the class difference between them (hence the subtitle, \"The World Between Us.\")",
      "If it wasn't clear from Season 1, Season 2 has firmly established that James' father, Mortimer (Fedja van Hu\u00eat), is the show's big bad. In the wake of the death of his wife \u2014 which was revealed in the last minutes of the Season 1 finale \u2014 his efforts to control his children, James and Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), only intensified.",

Since Season 1, he's had on-again, off-again trysts with Lydia Beaufort, who's now pregnant with twins. He's summoned before school leaders, including Mortimer, to explain what happened.",
      "During that meeting, it's revealed the affair was discovered via a photo. (Remember: In Episode 5, Elaine (Eli Riccardi), who's in love with James, and Cyril (Ben Felipe), who's long pined for Lydia, discovered Lydia and Graham embracing in the woods during a school function and took a photo as evidence.)",
      "But when Graham sees the photo that started the inquest, it turns out to be a picture not of him and Lydia, but of him and Ruby from a school gala in Season 1.",
      "The scene then cuts to a meeting with Ruby, her mother and the headmaster. He tells her she's been suspended from Maxton Hall and will never attend Oxford.",

      "Almost all of NATO's foreign ministers gathered in Brussels on Wednesday, a day after inconclusive Ukraine peace talks between the United States and President Vladimir Putin, and as European officials struggled for a seat at the negotiating table.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that despite the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 believed to be the first time in 22 years that America's top diplomat did not attend a ministerial gathering of this kind \u2014 he remained \"very much involved\" in the process.",
      "Rutte said he was in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Rubio, adding: \u201cI would not read anything in it.\u201d When it comes to the NATO elements of any peace deal \"that will be dealt with separately, and that obviously will include NATO,\" he said.",
      "Some European nations have expressed extreme disquiet at being  apparently sidelined in talks.",
      "\u201cFor any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\u201d the E.U.\u2019s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters last month.",
      "Lithuania\u2019s national security adviser, K\u0119stutis Budrys, told journalists in Brussels last month that Europe\u2019s security \u201cmust not be discussed without Europe.\u201d",
      "Russia wanted \u201cto push out Americans from Europe, and to review the security architecture\u201d on the continent, he added.",
      "Lithuania sits between the Russian territory of Kaliningrad and staunch Kremlin ally Belarus, and was occupied by the Soviet Union until the end of Communism in 1990. It and fellow Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia have long feared an emboldened Russia.",
      "European leaders were also blindsided by President Donald Trump\u2019s 28-point plan last month, which was seen as leaving not just Ukraine, but also the whole continent vulnerable.",
      "Despite Rutte's conciliatory comments, Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" according to William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was Colin Powell in 2003, attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "When asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during these ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite being sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",
      "He added, \"it may seem that the Europeans are powerless in the face of Trump\u2019s style of leadership,\" but \"we already have seen the so-called 'peace plan' change radically over the past days, with Ukrainian and European concerns increasingly reflected.\"",
      "Before meeting with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war, and if it weren't for European obstruction, then a deal would long have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe, and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he added.",
      "There was no real expectation of a breakthrough heading into the talks in Moscow, as the Kremlin did not show any intention of easing off on its hard-line demands.",
      "Still, Moscow called the five-hour conversation \u201cuseful\u201d and said some points could be agreed on, while others were viewed \u201cnegatively\u201d by Putin. The parties also discussed the issue of territories \u2014 a key and very sensitive point for Ukraine \u2014 and that some American proposals on that looked \u201cmore or less acceptable\u201d to the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",

    "summary": "After a quiet start, Pope Leo XI, the first American pontiff appears to have found his voice on his trip to Turkey and Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

    "summary": "The Beirut port explosion and the economic collapse that followed led some Maronite Catholics to leave Lebanon. Pope Leo's Lebanon visit has renewed hope.",
    "story": [
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Holy icons no longer witness Mass at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in the Lebanese capital and there are no pews five years after an explosion in the main port sent a devastating shock wave through the city.",
      "While new slabs of white marble have replaced the old floor and the walls are freshly painted, the Rev. Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",
      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",
      "Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency \"expects those results in the next few weeks.\"",
      "Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.",
      "An outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah continues to grow. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.",
      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. NBC affiliate KSL reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.",
      "As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died."

    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Prosecutors say these were worth hundreds of thousands of shekels. Milchan previously conceded in court that he gave \u201cexcessive\u201d gifts to Netanyahu, but neither he nor Packer are facing charges and both have denied wrongdoing.",
      "If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison for bribery and a maximum three-year term for each count of fraud and breach of trust.",
      "Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and the first sitting Israeli leader to have taken the stand as a criminal defendant, has consistently denied the allegations, branding them a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d A verdict in the ongoing five-year trial isn\u2019t expected until 2026 at the earliest, while Netanyahu will also have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence. Pardons before a court verdict are extremely rare but not unheard of in Israel. Netanyahu made no admission of guilt in seeking a pardon, and continued to deny the charges as he made the request.",
      "A spokesperson for Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Netanyahu\u2019s request for a pardon was \u201cextraordinary,\u201d carrying with it \u201csignificant implications.\u201d",
      "Herzog is from a different political movement than Netanyahu, and relations between the two men have occasionally been strained.",
      "In accordance with \u201cguidelines and procedures,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s  request is \u201ccurrently being transferred to the Pardons Department in the Ministry of Justice which will gather the opinions of all the relevant authorities,\u201d read the statement, without indicating when a decision might be reached.",
      "In his video message, Netanyahu also cited Trump\u2019s recent appeal for the trial to be canceled, saying it would allow the two leaders to \u201cpromote more vigorously the vital interests shared by Israel and the United States in a window of time that is unlikely to return.\u201d",
      "Trump penned a letter to Herzog two weeks ago asking the president to grant Netanyahu a full pardon.",
      "At the time, Herzog\u2019s office had said that \u201canyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.\u201d",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir both immediately backed the proposed pardon on Sunday, with Katz citing the \u201ccomplex security reality\u201d in Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has previously cited the war in Gaza and security concerns while seeking delays in the court proceedings.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that there should be no pardon without \"an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life.\"",
      "Benny Gantz, another political rival of Netanyahu\u2019s, said that the pardon request was \u201cfake\u201d and urged the leader: \u201cInstead of fanning the flames, extinguish the fire you created within Israeli society.\u201d",
      "In an unrelated case, the International Criminal Court last year issued a warrant for Netanyahu\u2019s arrest over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. The warrant theoretically puts Netanyahu at risk of arrest if he steps foot in an ICC member country, though the body has no police force and is reliant on international cooperation.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu\u2019s office branding the decision as \u201cantisemitic\u201d and rejecting the charges as \u201cabsurd and false.\u201d"

      "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, for a \"constructive\" five-hour meeting Tuesday, but more work needs to be done, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin, said in a video the Kremlin posted online.",
      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "He added: \u201cOnly Putin can end this war on the Russian side. \u2026 We have tried to bring both sides together and see what proposals we could come up with that both sides could live with. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make it work.\u201d",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin simply doesn\u2019t want a deal that\u2019s anything short of what it wants,\u201d such as a watered-down security guarantee for Ukraine and territorial concessions by Kyiv, said Michael A. Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite Russia expecting Ukraine to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but also counterattack. Still, Russian forces are now in control of roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.",

    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley ordered the subsequent strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Washington Post reported that Bradley had ordered the second strike, and that he was complying with an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d NBC News has not confirmed the detail about Hegseth.",
      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened. The president said he \"wouldn't have wanted\" it, adding that \"Pete said he did not want them.\" Asked again if there was no second strike, Trump said: \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",
      "Leavitt's comments come amid widespread criticism and bipartisan investigations in the House and Senate into the second boat strike. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u2014 said in a statement Friday that they will be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"",
      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",
      "Hegseth received backlash on social media after he posted on his personal X account what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the children's book character Franklin, with the title, \"Franklin targets Narco Terrorists.\" It shows Franklin, a turtle, standing on the edge of a helicopter aiming a machine gun at boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela. Trump declared in a Truth Social post Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"closed,\" which came as the U.S. is considering military action against the South American nation."

      "Before that, Witkoff, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met in Florida with a delegation from Ukraine, which has been damaged by the removal of its top negotiator in a corruption scandal.",

      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",

      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",

      "A top Ukrainian official at the heart of peace talks resigned on Friday after being thrust into the center of a massive corruption scandal, threatening to further weaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a crucial moment in negotiations to end Russia\u2019s war.",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy\u2019s powerful chief of staff, quit hours after his home was searched early Friday by investigators with Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau (NABU), which is leading the $100 million kickback probe involving the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a later video statement that Yermak had handed in his resignation and he was looking for his replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "The shocking development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that initially offered Moscow its core hard-line demands.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Russia for talks next week."

      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will \u201cpermanently pause\u201d all immigration from what he called \u201cthird world countries\u201d and demanded a program of \u201creverse migration\u201d as he intensified his rhetoric after the National Guard shooting in Washington, D.C.",
      "Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S. in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.",
      "Officials have said that Wednesday\u2019s attack on two troops was  carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America\u2019s global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.",
      "\u201cI will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "On Friday, the State Department took the first step: stopping issuance of U.S. visas for all Afghan nationals.",
      "\"The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports,\" the State Department said in a post on X. \"The Department is taking all necessary steps to protect U.S. national security and public safety.\"",
      "Additionally, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on X that \"USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"",
      "It was not clear exactly which other countries Trump was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum-seekers.",
      "The president also threatened to \u201cend all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country\u201d and to \u201cdenaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.\u201d",
      "In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was \u201cnon-compatible with Western Civilization.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cOnly REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would re-examine the status of green card holders from 19 countries \u201cof concern,\u201d including Afghanistan.",
      "In a subsequent post, Trump said that \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Somali migrants were \u201ccompletely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protected status \u2014 which prevents deportations to dangerous countries \u2014 for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the East African country.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many people this would affect, but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as \u201cretarded\u201d and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who was born in Somalia, \u201cprobably came into the U.S.A. illegally\u201d and is from a \u201cdecadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged, but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban\u2019s legality.",
      "Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.",
      "\u201cUsing this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.",
      "U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said at a Geneva press briefing: \u201cThey are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.\u201d",
      "U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: \u201cWhen people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,\u201d she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.",
      "The term \u201cthird world\u201d originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn\u2019t aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.",
      "The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.",
      "Economists and health experts have for years said the phrase is inaccurate, derogatory and outdated. The World Bank and other global institutions no longer use the phrase and some have suggested also avoiding its successor, \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."
