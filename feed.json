      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is dominating the box office in its opening weekend in North America",
      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d has powered up the box office once again. The sequel opened in 3,412 theaters in the U.S. and Canada this weekend and far surpassed expectations with $63 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Seemingly immune to widely negative reviews, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d notched the biggest opening ever for the weekend after Thanksgiving, which usually is a more muted buffet of leftovers. It\u2019s also the biggest opening of the year for a PG-13 rated movie and the second biggest horror opening, behind \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites.\u201d The movies and the game are about a family restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, whose anthropomorphic robots turn murderous at night.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of doom and gloom about the industry overall, but this movie helped drive the industry to the biggest first weekend post-Thanksgiving ever,\" said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal.",
      "The first film, also a Blumhouse production, was a surprise hit two years ago. It opened to $80 million in October 2023, despite also being available to stream on Peacock. Universal decided to open the sequel exclusively in theaters. With a reported production price tag of only $36 million, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is on its way to being another smash. It\u2019s another reminder of the potential massive upside of theatrical releases as many in the industry and out wonder what Netflix\u2019s acquisition of Warner Bros. will mean for moviegoing.",
      "The sequel, written by the game\u2019s creator Scott Cawthon, saw the return of cast members like Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Lail as well as director Emma Tammi. Reviews were dismal, even worse than the first. Mark Kennedy, in his zero star review for The Associated Press, called it an \u201cincoherent mess.\u201d But horror fans have been known to turn out for opening weekends regardless of reviews. This audience had a decidedly more positive take. According to PostTrak polling data, 70% of ticket buyers said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d recommend \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to their friends.",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, the head of marketplace trends for Comscore, said that the teen video gamer audience is sometimes underestimated and this weekend proves once again that given the right film, will come out to the movie theater for that communal experience with fellow fans.",
      "It was also enough to push the more family-friendly \u201cZootopia 2\u201d into second place in its second weekend in theaters, where it added $43 million in North America. But the Disney film isn\u2019t hurting after its record Thanksgiving opening. With $219 million from 52 territories internationally, including China, the running global total is an eye-popping $915.8 million. It's officially pushed Walt Disney Studio releases over the $5 billion mark globally \u2014 the only studio to do so this year.",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d also a Universal release, landed in third place in its third weekend with $16.8 million from 3,985 theaters, brining its domestic total just shy of $297 million.",
      "Fourth place went to Gkids\u2019 anime \u201cJujutsu Kaisen: Execution\u201d which opened to an estimated $10.2 million, while Lionsgate's \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don't\u201d rounded out the top five with $3.5 million, pushing its running global total to $210 million.",
      "\u201cKill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d was close behind with $3.3 million from 1,198 theaters. Quentin Tarantino combined \u201cKill Bill: Vol. 1\" and \u201cVol. 2\u201d into a four hour and 35-minute epic (including a 15 minute intermission). The Lionsgate release got a rare A+ CinemaScore from an audience that was 72% male. According to the studio, most of the 70mm and 35mm showings were sold out. Due to the demand for the film prints, the studio is exploring an extended run. \u201cKill Bill\u201d star Lucy Liu had a big weekend at New York's AMC Lincoln Square where the independent drama \u201cRosemead\u201d made $50,243 from one screen.",
      "A filmed version of the Tony-winning revival of \u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\u201d starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and released by Sony Pictures Classics, opened just outside of the top 10 with $1.2 million from 1,084 screens.",
      "The running annual domestic box office just this weekend surpassed $8 billion. Since the pandemic, it's only surpassed $9 billion once, in 2023, when \u201cBarbie\u201d topped the year. Prior to 2020, it would regularly hit $11 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but every movie is going to have to overperform in some way if we\u2019re going to get to the $9 billion threshold,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",

      "The Golden Globes have introduced a best podcast category that's likely to spark conversations",
      "NEW YORK -- The Golden Globes this year introduced a best podcast category and, predictably, the nominees announced Monday will get people talking.",
      "The six nominees for the inaugural best podcast award are \u201cArmchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d \u201cGood Hang with Amy Poehler,\u201d \u201cThe Mel Robbins Podcast,\u201d \u201cSmartLess\u201d and \u201cUp First,\u201d from NPR. Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year. The left-leaning \u201cPod Save America\u201d also was snubbed, as were popular true crime podcasts like \u201cMorbid\u201d and \u201cRotten Mango.\u201d",
      "Ben Bogardus, a professor and chair of the journalism department at Quinnipiac University, said it seemed that the Globes' voting body \u2014 after years of scandal for the beleaguered awards show \u2014 wanted to avoid any controversy, like inviting a podcast host who might show up and say something contentious.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to bill themselves as an award show that is for the masses and non-controversial, celebrating the best in entertainment. Having this political sideshow, I think they just wanted to avoid that,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to the apparent snubbing of politics-related podcasts early Monday was light, with a handful of X users weighing in with criticism that high-ranking programs from personalities like Rogan and \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcaster Theo Von had been left off the final cut. There was no direct reaction from the hosts themselves.",
      "Shapiro had launched an all-out Golden Globes publicity campaign for his decade-old podcast, on which he\u2019s spoken with the likes of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past year. In addition to making the rounds with industry publications, Shapiro also secured massive billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square.",
      "The 25 potential candidates \u2014 including The New York Times' \u201cThe Daily\u201d and Barstool Sports' \u201cPardon My Take\u201d \u2014 mostly matched up with the most listened-to shows.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s how you want to pick your \u2018best podcast,\u2019 that\u2019s certainly one starting point and one way to do it,\u201d says Karl Hughes, a 20-year podcasting veteran who is CEO of The Podcast Consultant. \u201cI think it leaves a lot of stuff out. It leaves a lot of nuance out.\u201d",
      "Eligible podcasts must have original content and must have released at least six episodes between Jan. 1, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025, with each episode having a minimum length of 30 minutes. The award, which will be handed out at the Nikki Glaser-hosted show Jan. 11, recognizes \u201cthe quality, creativity, audience engagement and impact\u201d of the podcast, per the Globes.",
      "Many podcast experts were left scratching their heads since the Globes didn't use any categories for its long list and was a bit murky about what constituted a best podcast. Quality of production? Consistency? The stories being told? Raw numbers?",

      "Controversy almost immediately ensued after the initial announcement when it was revealed that Luminate Data, an entertainment tracking and analytics company, would create the shortlist. Luminate belongs to Penske Media Corp., which owns the Globes. Then there\u2019s the accompanying costs associated with traditional ad campaigns for the award in the pages of Variety and The Hollywood Reporter \u2014 also owned by Penske. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While more digital-friendly awards shows like the Webby Awards, the Ambies, iHeartRadio and The Shorty Awards recognize podcasting, the Globes' move marks the first time podcasts have been included by a major awards show.",
      "Hughes says that's a natural step as podcasting matures and starts attracting more corporate dollars. He hopes the Globes' spotlight will make podcasting accessible to more people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll open up the door for more individuals and businesses that want to use the medium to tell interesting stories because it\u2019s got a little more respect, a little more gravitas, a little more mainstream appeal,\u201d he said.",
      "Bogardus marveled at how the podcasting industry has grown up in the past 25 years, moving beyond its origins in radio and giving hosts freedom that content creators in other media don't have: \u201cGoing into an award show now really shows that it has come into its own as a type of communication that people consume, which can be on par with television, with radio, with streaming, with internet videos, with social media.\u201d",

      "The lecture was part of the Nobel week that is underway in Stockholm and Oslo with laureates holding news conferences and giving speeches before they are awarded the prestigious prizes.",
      "Krasznahorkai's lecture, which he gave in Hungarian, ranged across topics such as old and new angels, human dignity, hope or the lack thereof, rebellion and his observations of a clochard \u2014 or tramp \u2014 on the Berlin subway.",
      "He introduced his lecture, according to the English translation, by saying that \u201con receiving the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, I originally wished to share my thought with you on the subject of hope, but as my stores of hope have definitely come to an end, I will now speak about angels.\u201d",
      "As opposed to \u201cthe angels of old,\u201d the new angels, Krasznahorkai said, \u201chave no wings, but they also have no message, none whatsoever. They are merely here among us in their simple street clothes, unrecognizable if they so wish.",
      "\u201cThey just stand there and look at us, they are searching for our gaze, and in this search there is a plea for us, to look into their eyes, so that we ourselves can transmit a message to them, only that unfortunately, we have no message to give,\u201d the author writes in sad, yet poetic prose.",
      "Expressing himself in his long, winding trademark sentences full of apocalypse but without full stops, he says it comes as a shock when he \u201cdetects the horrific story of these new angels that stand before me, the story that they are sacrifices, sacrifices: and not for us, but because of us, for every single one of us, because of every single one of us, angels without wings and angels without a message, and all the while knowing that there is war, war and only war, war in nature, war in society, and this war is being waged not only with weapons, not only with torture, not only with destruction: of course, this is one end of the scale, but this war proceeds at the opposite of the scale as well, because one single bad word is enough.\u201d",
      "When the Nobel judges announced the award for Krasznahorkai in October, they described the 71-year-old as \u201ca great epic writer\u201d whose work \u201cis characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess.\u201d",
      "\u201cKrasznahorkai\u2019s work can be seen as part of a Central European tradition,\" the Nobel Prize organization said. \u201dImportant features are pessimism and apocalypse, but also humor and unpredictability.\"",

      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush. Somalis, after all, are often described as \"a nation of poets.\" Their work often venerates pastoral well-being and the traditional roles of men and women in the predominantly Islamic society.",
      "Some poets like Hadraawi \u2014 the \u201cShakespeare of Somalia\u201d who died in 2022 \u2014 have achieved universal recognition. \u201cHadraawi\u2019s oeuvre includes a broad repertoire, from love songs to laments of war,\u201d Harvard University's Archive of World Music noted after his death.",
      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",
      "On the morning Hassan Barre sang his poem, a group of young Somalis were practicing a folk dance that emphasized traditional values, like dutifully cultivating the land. A group of poets, including one woman, sat nearby, talking quietly.",

Are you fools asking me to do that?'\u201d Trump said back then. \u201cAnd then Susie Wiles said to me, \u2018Sir, I\u2019d like you to host.' I said, OK, Susie, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Trump said, referring to his White House chief of staff.",
      "Trump spent several hours at the Kennedy Center on Friday. He participated in the FIFA World Cup draw for 2026 and accepted its inaugural peace prize. Trump also met in a group with the leaders of Canada and Mexico.",

      "Iran's most-famous singer has written an account of her life as she embarks on a farewell tour",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- For Googoosh, Iran's most-famous singer, life always has been balancing act of one kind or another.",
      "It began as a child, performing with her acrobat father who balanced her on a chair atop another chair resting only on his chin. Then later, as an icon of stage and screen during the last years of the shah, her looks and hairstyles were copied by Iranian women who wanted to look more \u201cGoogooshi,\" a Farsi adjective all her own.",
      "Then came the decades of silence after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, barred from performing, only to return to the stage abroad in 2000. And now, embarking on a farewell tour, she's adding author as her latest reinvention as her homeland undergoes a societal change yet again.",
      "\u201cI did not realize that all these challenges and struggles were considered a balancing act,\" the 75-year-old singer told The Associated Press. \"If that is what it means, then yes, I have spent my entire life trying to create and maintain a balance between my personal life and my artistic life.\u201d",
      "The new book by the singer, born Faegheh Atashin, is called \u201cGoogoosh: A Sinful Voice.\u201d In it, Googoosh with the help of co-author Tara Dehlavi recounts a life shaped by both the political forces that have changed Iran in the modern era and her tumultuous personal life.",
      "But it all began with performing at an early age with her father, Saber Atashin, to whom the book is dedicated along with the people of Iran. Googoosh recounts falling only once in the shows, her father catching her. But from the first performance atop the chair, Googoosh appeared bound for the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThey held their breath and waited in complete silence,\u201d she recounted. \u201cEvery muscle in my body tensed. Seconds felt like an eternity. Finally, Papa slowly began to lower me gently toward the ground. When my feet touched the floor, the audience sighed in relief before they erupted into roaring applause. I had survived. And we were a hit!\u201d",
      "Googoosh began singing and performing in films at a young age. That included before the royal court of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who later became mortally ill and fled Iran just before the 1979 revolution.",
      "Googoosh had been tabloid fodder in Iran before the revolution. Married four times in her life, her personal life long had been a fascination. And within her book, she recounts undergoing abortions and battling with substance abuse around and after the revolution, including freebasing cocaine and smoking opium. She considers suicide at one point in New York City before deciding to go back to Iran under its newly formed theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere were times where I would ask this question to you and say, \u2018Are you sure you want to share this?\u2019\" Dehlavi, her co-author said. \"And you always said that, \u2018I\u2019m either I\u2019m telling my story or I\u2019m not. I have to I have to tell it all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Returning to Iran, Googoosh found herself harassed by its newly empowered theocracy, which put a lien on her home and blocked her ability to be issued a passport. Authorities banned her from performing or singing, she recounted, and at one point imprisoned her",
      "But she describes while trying to hide her identity in public or in private, people always pushed her to sing again, to find her voice despite the restrictions and threats.",

I did not want that life. I hoped I could somehow continue performing for my own people, inside my own country.\u201d",
      "Ultimately though, in 2000 under the government of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, Googoosh was able to get a contract to perform abroad, pull the money together to pay off her liens, obtain a passport and leave Iran. She never returned, but has performed abroad for the last 25 years for Iranians who similarly are homesick for their country.",
      "Islamic hard-liners within Iran still denounce her, particularly after 2014 music video about homosexual love, punishable by death in the country.",
      "Googoosh's new book and her farewell tour come at a time of change in Iran. More and more, Iranian women choose to forgo the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed enraged women of all ages and views in a way few other issues have since the revolution.",
      "But meanwhile, Iran's economy continues to strain under international sanctions over its nuclear program. Its theocracy continues to execute people in the wake of the 12-day war with Israel, while also increasingly targeting intellectuals and others with arrest.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing our youth, especially women, fighting for their most basic rights, including choosing what to wear, expressing their art freely if they have artistic talent, and living a normal life like people in other parts of the world,\u201d Googoosh said.",
      "\"People in my country are struggling to give their families an ordinary life. They struggle for clean water, clean air, and land where they can live. Our young people grew old without ever enjoying their youth. Our people must end this painful cycle and gain the freedoms every human being deserves.\u201d",
      "But asked what her plans were once her tour ended, Googoosh left open the possibility of once again getting back on the stage.",
      "\u201cThroughout my life I have almost never been able to plan my future. Everything has simply happened to me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not controlled our own lives for 47 years. Whatever we planned never happened, and whatever happened was never planned by us. I am no exception, and I expect to continue living this way.\u201d",
      "She added: \"Still, I prefer to leave my artistic work for a day when the Islamic Republic no longer exists in my country.\u201d",

      "Pannists, as the players are known, boast about the steelpan being able to belt out any genre of music. Add the influence of whatever is trending, and you get an instrument that\u2019s growing its fanbase at a rapid pace.",
      "\u201cPan is an out-of-body experience, that\u2019s the best way I can describe it,\u201d said 17-year-old student Jael Grant.",

      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "\u201cThis felt like breaking the system,\u201d said Stewart, speaking after the afternoon show. \u201cI genuinely had an emotional response to the show. I felt like I just saw so many different versions of a person walking. It wasn't one woman.\"",
      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s the vortex of the city,\" Blazy said. \"It connects everything.\u201d",

      "If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood\u2019s year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear",
      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

      "DALLAS -- From the election of Zohran Mamdani to the intrigue surrounding the jewel heist at the Louvre, keeping up with this year's news also left some Americans struggling with pronunciations. That's put both the name of New York City's incoming mayor and the famed Paris museum on a list of the most mispronounced words in 2025.",
      "The language-learning company Babbel and closed-captioning company The Captioning Group on Thursday released a list of the words that news anchors, politicians and other public figures in the U.S. struggled with the most this year, giving an overview of the people and topics that had Americans talking.",
      "As Mamdani made his political rise, the democratic socialist's name often was mangled. When he takes office in January, the 34-year-old will become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor, first born in Africa and first of South Asian heritage. Babbel said his name \u2014 which should be pronounced zoh-RAHN mam-DAH-nee \u2014 was most commonly mispronounced when people swapped the \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d in his last name.",

      "The man was arrested inside the store minutes after the alleged theft. He appeared in the Auckland District Court on Nov. 29, where he did not enter a plea on a charge of theft.",
      "The alleged loot was a limited-edition, Faberg\u00e9 egg pendant inspired by the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy. Central to the film's plot is a jewel-smuggling operation that involves a fake Faberg\u00e9 egg.",

      "In the U.S., the most-streamed artist list looks somewhat similar: There, Swift leads, followed by Drake, Morgan Wallen and Kendrick Lamar. Bad Bunny is in the fifth spot.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine \u2014 the first shot found to prevent cancer.",
      "Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s committee on Thursday is expected to change that \u2014 contradicting previous public health advice.",
      "It's not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization's Dr. Sean O'Leary.",
      "\u201cWe are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.",
      "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some \u2014 especially infants and children \u2014 it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use.",
      "But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don't completely clear the virus.",
      "As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981.",
      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired all 17 members of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",

      "\u201cAre we asking our babies to solve an adult problem?\u201d committee member Dr. Evelyn Griffin asked at a September meeting.",
      "Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: \u201cThe signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It\u2019s one of trust. ... It\u2019s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.\"",
      "The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it's slated to be acted on during Thursday's meeting, according to the agenda. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",
      "But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O'Leary said.",
      "The committee's most direct power comes over what's covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.",
      "But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added.",
      "\u201cIf it scares, it shares\u201d on social media, O'Leary said.",
      "Several medical and public health organizations \u2014 and even some state government officials \u2014 have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.",
      "U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, this week called on Congress to compel Kennedy to appear at a hearing and explain ACIP's actions.",

      "The five-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Kenya was signed Thursday by Kenyan President William Ruto and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to replace a patchwork of previous health agreements that had traditionally been run by the U.S. Agency for International Development for decades until the Trump administration dismantled it earlier this year.",
      "The elimination of USAID as a separate agency sparked widespread criticism and concern in the global health community as its immediate impact resulted in the defunding of multiple hundreds of programs focused on the developing world, including cuts to maternal and child care, nutrition and anti-HIV/AIDS programs.",
      "Rubio said the agreement with Kenya \u201caims to strengthen U.S. leadership and excellence in global health while eliminating dependency, ideology, inefficiency, and waste from our foreign assistance architecture.\u201d He also praised Kenya for its role in leading and contributing to the international stabilization force working to combat powerful gangs in Haiti.",
      "Ruto lauded the agreement and said Kenya would continue to play a role in Haiti as the gang suppression force transitions to a broader operation.",
      "Under the health deal with Kenya, the U.S. will contribute $1.7 billion of the total amount, with the Kenyan government covering the remaining $850 million. The agreement focuses on preventing and treating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis with an emphasis on faith-based medical providers, although all clinics and hospitals enrolled in Kenya\u2019s health insurance system will be eligible to receive funding, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cThis cooperation framework is quite a departure from the past and will have a lasting impact on health for all,\u201d said Ouma Oluga, Kenya's principal secretary for medical services.",

      "A new study suggests a single HPV vaccination appears just as effective as two doses at preventing the viral infection that causes cervical cancer",
      "WASHINGTON -- A single HPV vaccination appears just as effective as two doses at preventing the viral infection that causes cervical cancer, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own but some linger, causing cancers that appear years later, including cervical cancer in women and rarer cancers in both women and men.",
      "HPV vaccination has been recommended for U.S. girls since 2006 and already the nation is counting fewer cases of precancerous cervical lesions among women in their 20s \u2014- the first age group to start getting the shots back when they were tweens or teens.",
      "But cervical cancer kills about 340,000 women worldwide annually \u2014 and the new findings from a huge study in Costa Rica could help spur global efforts to protect more girls and young women in harder-to-reach low-income countries.",
      "Led by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the study enrolled more than 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16. Researchers tested two different HPV vaccines used around the world, giving half the girls one shot type and the rest the other. Then six months later, half of the girls got a second dose of their assigned vaccine \u2014 while the rest instead received an unrelated child vaccination.",
      "They all were tracked for five years, receiving regular cervical tests for the most cancer-prone HPV strains. Infection rates were compared to a separate unvaccinated group.",
      "A single HPV shot provided about 97% protection, similar to two doses, concluded researchers from the NCI and Costa Rica\u2019s Agency for Biomedical Research. The findings were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Previous studies had suggested one dose could work well but the new findings confirm strong protection for at least five years, Dr. Ruanne Barnabas, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, wrote in an accompanying editorial.",

      "A new wave of peptides, often banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, is easily available online, raising concerns about potential Olympic doping scandals",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- The next Olympic doping scandal could be delivered right to your doorstep.",
      "A trove of so-called research chemicals known as peptides, many of them banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and some not approved for human use in the United States, are available with the simple click of a button through online retailers. One seller is Amazon. Another is Alibaba, a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid. With the Milan Cortina Games just two months away, they are hoping to break a string of scandals involving the Russians and Chinese that have disrupted the Games, both summer and winter, since 2014.",
      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",
      "\u201cThese substances have proliferated,\u201d said Oliver Catlin, president of the Anti-Doping Sciences Institute, whose late father, Don, was among the godfathers of antidoping research.",
      "Most of these peptides are so-called \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are also banned by the WADA code, either under its \u201cS2\u201d category that encompasses peptides or under its \u201cSO\u201d classification, a catch-all category for \"non-approved substances.\"",
      "The few substances specifically listed under the \u201cS0\" category \u2014 such as the popular BPC 157 \u2014 are placed there because the pharmalogical make-up of the substances don't fit neatly into another category on the banned list.",
      "One tricky part of the \u201cS0\u201d category is that it includes unapproved substances that aren't specifically listed because, for instance, there is no way to test for that drug and regulators don't want to reveal that to users.",
      "Catlin's research found hundreds of the banned or illegal peptides available on the online market and an ever-shifting menu of items, with some of them removed after The Associated Press started asking questions.",
      "\u201cIt's not like it happened overnight,\" he said. \"The mainstream use of peptides has exploded in the last five years.\u201d",
      "Dan Burke, a former FDA official who now heads intelligence and investigations at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said the new-age peptides are hard to corral online because the American law prohibiting their sale dates to 1938 \u201cand it just isn\u2019t working and doesn\u2019t work to this day.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bad guys know it, and that\u2019s why the stuff proliferates,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Though some peptides \u2014 insulin and the newly popular weight-loss dynamo GLP-1 are among the best examples \u2014 are time-tested, perfectly legal (with a prescription) and effective, other substances in the category are not legally marketable, either as supplements or prescription or over-the-counter drugs.",
      "A number of them, including BPC-157, could be found on multiple online sites, including Amazon and Alibaba. The latter is a major IOC sponsor \u201ccommitted to helping the IOC transform the Olympic Games for the digital era.\u201d",
      "Asked by AP about this connection, an IOC spokesperson said Alibaba \u201cconfirmed to us that it consistently monitors its marketplaces and that it does not have prohibited substances for sale from the WADA 2025 list.\u201d Approached by AP, a representative for Alibaba.com asked for links to \u201cproblematic\u201d drugs sold by its marketplace and, after the AP sent two of them, said they had removed those items.",

      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",
      "The Supreme Court halted Froble's ruling pending resolution of appeals in the case. In light of that, the board said in a statement that it \u201cis reinstating its directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance.\u201d",
      "The board further said its priority is to ensure compliance with the vaccine law \u201cand safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.\u201d",
      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. In June, the board directed public schools to ignore Morrisey's executive order. Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Legislation that would have allowed the religious exemptions was passed by the state Senate and rejected by the House of Delegates earlier this year.

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",

      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

      "Reported abuses against civilians intensified when Wagner joined the underfunded Malian army in 2021. According to private security analysts, Mali paid Russia about $10 million a month for Wagner\u2019s assistance. While the group was never officially under the Kremlin's command, it had close ties to Russia\u2019s intelligence and military.",
      "Moscow began developing the Africa Corps as a rival to Wagner after its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash in 2023 following his brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin.",
      "It is unclear whether the terms of Mali's agreement remain the same for Africa Corps. Much is unknown about its operations, including the number of fighters, which analysts estimate at around 2,000.",
      "Not all Africa Corps fighters are Russian. Several refugees told the AP they saw Black men speaking foreign languages. The European Council on Foreign Relations in a recent report said the unit recruits from Russia, Belarus and African states.",
      "Africa Corps and Malian forces have increased their joint offensives in northern Mali, home to substantial gold reserves, according to the Critical Threats project by the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "While civilian deaths blamed on the Russians have dropped this year \u2014 447 so far compared with 911 last year \u2014 the numbers might not reflect the full scale, Nsaibia said: \u201cPeople are more scared to report, in order to avoid putting their own safety on the line.\"",
      "Fewer outsiders are watching. A U.N. peacekeeping mission withdrew from Mali in 2023 under government pressure. Mali's withdrawal this year from the International Criminal Court has further complicated efforts to track abuses. The ICC has been investigating serious crimes committed in Mali since 2012, when fighting with armed groups began.",
      "Eduardo Gonzalez Cueva, a U.N. independent expert on human rights in Mali, told the AP he asked the country\u2019s military authorities twice this year for permission to visit, and sent them a questionnaire. They did not respond.",
      "Mali\u2019s government considers investigations into alleged abuses \u201cinconvenient and harmful to the morale of the troops,\u201d Cueva said in his latest report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, noting that \u201cthe escalation of serious human rights violations and abuses by all actors is accelerating due to impunity.\u201d",
      "When Wagner announced its departure from Mali, some refugees decided to return home. Many found that nothing had changed.",
      "\u201cIt was the same thing,\u201d said one, Bocar, who spoke with resignation as he cradled his youngest son. He said he had seen bodies with organs missing.",
      "He said he had counted all the men killed or abducted by Wagner and Mali\u2019s army in his hometown of Lere before he first fled in 2023. He said the list reached 214 people.",
      "\u201cOnly the name was changed,\u201d he said of Africa Corps. \u201cThe clothes, the vehicles, the people stayed the same. The methods stayed the same, and even became worse. So we left home again.\u201d",
      "Other refugees described being so terrified of the Russians that at any noise resembling an engine, they would run or climb the nearest tree.",
      "One woman said she was so frantic to flee Wagner fighters that she once left her 3-month-old baby at home. When she returned hours later, her daughter was laying in front of the house, her tiny hands clenched into fists.",
      "\u201cI was so scared, I forgot I had a baby,\u201d the woman said, clutching her daughter.",
      "Legal experts said the shift from Wagner to Africa Corps makes the Russian government directly accountable for fighters\u2019 actions.",
      "\u201cDespite the rebranding, there is striking continuity in personnel, commanders, tactics and even insignia between Wagner and Africa Corps,\u201d said Lindsay Freeman, senior director of international accountability at the UC Berkeley School of Law's Human Rights Center, which has monitored the conflict in Mali.",
      "Because Africa Corps is directly embedded in Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, it can be treated as an organ of the Russian state under international law, Freeman said. \u201cThat means any war crimes committed by Africa Corps in Mali are, in principle, attributable to the Russian government under the rules on state responsibility.\u201d",
      "When white men came to the village of Kurmare less than a month ago, Fatma said everyone fled but her.",
      "At the sound of gunshots, her 18-year-old daughter had a seizure and fell, unconscious. Fatma stayed with her as the men looted the village and shot at people running away.",

      "In one of the world's most volatile nations, Somalis must be aware of their responsibility to their country and each other, he said in a recital emphasizing good citizenship.",
      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush.

      "Some poets like Hadraawi \u2014 the \u201cShakespeare of Somalia\u201d who died in 2022 \u2014 have achieved universal recognition. \u201cHadraawi\u2019s oeuvre includes a broad repertoire, from love songs to laments of war,\u201d Harvard University's Archive of World Music noted after his death.",
      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",
      "On the morning Hassan Barre sang his poem, a group of young Somalis were practicing a folk dance that emphasized traditional values, like dutifully cultivating the land. A group of poets, including one woman, sat nearby, talking quietly.",
      "Some told The Associated Press they are trying to keep Somalia\u2019s poetic tradition alive despite security concerns and financial challenges that limit programming.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The commander of sea-drone operations for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency says more complex strikes against Russian forces are expected next year, after Kyiv\u2019s uncrewed fleet succeeded in curbing the movements of Russia\u2019s once-dominant Black Sea navy.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, the head of the specialized maritime drone unit, Group 13, said Ukraine\u2019s attacks have forced Russia to adapt, limiting opportunities for major Black Sea strikes seen earlier in the war.",
      "\u201cToday, we\u2019ve likely reached a plateau,\u201d said the officer, who is identified only by the call sign \u201c13th\u201d under Ukrainian military protocol.",

      "The officer said Russian naval vessels \u201cbarely operate,\u201d often venturing only up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) from port to fire missiles before retreating. \u201cThey constantly hide. And in a way, that\u2019s also a result of our unit \u2014 because you can imagine the cost of maintaining a fleet that cannot operate at sea.\u201d",

      "Refugees from Mali have told The Associated Press that a new Russian military unit, Africa Corps, is committing abuses like rapes and beheadings",
      "DAKAR. Senegal -- Dozens of people who have fled Mali tell The Associated Press that a new Russian military unit that replaced the Wagner mercenary group this year is carrying out abuses, including rapes and beheadings, as it teams up with Mali\u2019s military to hunt down extremists.",

      "He added: \u201cThere is no difference between Wagner and Africa Corps.\u201d",
      "Malian authorities never publicly acknowledged Wagner\u2019s presence, and have not acknowledged Africa Corps.

      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry did not respond to AP questions.",
      "Reported abuses against civilians intensified when Wagner teamed up with the underfunded Malian army in 2021.

      "BRUSSELS -- BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 European Union officials on Monday were finalizing a major overhaul of its migration system, including streamlined deportations and increased detentions.",
      "There has long been a fierce debate among EU members about migration. Since a surge in asylum-seekers and other migrants to Europe a decade ago, public debate on the issue has shifted and far-right parties have gained political power. EU migration policies have hardened, and the number of asylum-seekers is down from record levels.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump in recent days issued sharp criticism of EU migration policiesas part of a new national security strategy that paints European allies as weak.",
      "Ministers meeting in Brussels quickly agreed to a \u201csafe third country\u201d concept and a list of safe countries of origin, said Danish minister Rasmus Stoklund. It means that EU nations can deny residency and deport migrants because they either hail from a safe country or could apply for asylum in one outside the EU.",
      "\u201cWe will be able to reject people that have no reason for asylum in Europe, and then it will be possible for us to make mechanisms and procedures that enable us to return them faster,\u201d Stoklund said. \u201cIt should not be human smugglers that control the access to Europe, but it should be the European governments elected by the European people.\"",
      "Ministers also agreed to the formation of a \u201csolidarity pool\u201d to share costs of hosting refugees between member nations. The pool is designed to collect 430 million euros ($489 million) to disburse to countries facing greater migratory pressure including Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain in southern Europe. Hungary and Poland have long opposed any obligation for countries to host migrants or pay for their upkeep.",
      "\u201cIt is important to give the people also the feeling back that we have control over what is happening. It is everything about bringing our European house in order,\u201d said Magnus Brunner, the EU\u2019s commissioner for migration.",
      "Human rights groups said the EU's toughening of migration rules would mean more misery, not less migration.",

      "The EU wouldn\u2019t set up or manage such \u201creturn hubs,\u201d which could be in Europe or elsewhere, but would create the legal framework to allow states to negotiate with non-EU countries willing to take rejected asylum-seekers.",
      "It differs from the existing but so far ineffective deal signed by Italy with Albania to offshore the asylum processing of migrants rescued at sea. At the time, the contentious plan was applauded by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution to manage irregular migration, but courts in Italy have repeatedly blocked it.",

      "BENGALURU, India -- Climate change is battering Asia\u2019s water and power systems and putting millions in harm\u2019s way, forcing countries to pour billions into shoring up basic services, according to two recent reports.",
      "Water-related disasters are rising across the region even as spending to protect communities falls short. Asian nations will need $4 trillion for water and sanitation between 2025 and 2040 \u2014 about $250 billion a year, the Asian Development Bank said in a report released Monday.",
      "Governments are under growing pressure to protect power systems people rely on every day. By 2050, extreme weather could leave listed power companies in Asia-Pacific with about $8.4 billion a year in damage and lost revenue, a third higher than now, according to recent research by the Hong Kong-based non-profit Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the New York-based MSCI Institute, a sustainability think tank.",

      "The ADB report says 2.7 billion people, about 60% of the Asia-Pacific population, have access to water for most of their basic needs but more than 4 billion still remain exposed to unsafe water, degraded ecosystems and escalating climate hazards.",
      "Much of the progress since 2013 comes from major gains in rural water access, it says. About 800 million more people in rural areas now have piped water, helping many countries move out of the lowest level of water security. India played a big part in this shift.",
      "But Asia faces a triple threat: environmental pressures, low investment and climate change, said Vivek Raman, principal urban development specialist at the ADB and a lead author of the report.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two realities,\u201d Raman said.",
      "The report says water ecosystems were rapidly deteriorating or stagnating in 30 of the 50 Asian countries that were studied, plagued by unchecked development, pollution and land being converted to other uses. Asia also accounts for 41% of global flooding and its coastal megacities and Pacific islands face mounting threats from storm surges, rising sea levels and salty water pushing inland. From 2013 to 2023, Asia and the Pacific experienced 244 major floods, 104 droughts, and 101 severe storms \u2014 events that undermined development gains and caused widespread damage.",
      "Governments currently meet only 40% of the estimated $4 trillion in investment, or roughly $250 billion annually, in funding needed for water and sanitation from 2025-2040. That leaves an annual shortfall of over $150 billion.",
      "Asia\u2019s rapid growth is both an opportunity and a challenge said Amit Prothi, director general of New Delhi-based Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, who was not involved with the report. \u201cThe amount of infrastructure we\u2019ll build in Asia in the next three decades will be as much as what was built in the last two centuries. So, this is an opportunity to rethink and build in a new way,\u201d he said.",

      "Asia accounts for 60% of the world\u2019s power generation capacity and remains deeply reliant on coal. The report warns that climate changes threatens both energy security and economic growth across a region where over 4 billion people need reliable electricity.",
      "\u201cOverall, if you were looking at the types of impacts and the preparedness of companies, most companies are at very early stages,\u201d said Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change.",
      "Its study of 2,422 power plants across China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea found extreme heat to be the costliest hazard, responsible for over half of all losses by 2050. Heatwaves reduce power plant efficiency and strain transmission networks. India\u2019s main power utility NTPC, Indonesia\u2019s PLN, and Malaysia\u2019s Tenaga Nasional all face a high risk of disruptions caused by rising heat.",
      "Another major threat comes from declining river flows in Asia\u2019s major basins, which supply the water needed by coal and gas plants and fuel hydropower dams.",
      "At the same time, heavy rainfall and flooding also pose risks, especially in coastal and riverine regions. Malaysia\u2019s Tenaga Nasional faces some of the highest coastal flood exposure due to power plants built in low-lying areas, the report said.",
      "Despite mounting hazards, most utilities lacked detailed, funded plans for adapting to climate impacts. The report found that while nine companies of the 11 studied assessed how climate change impacts them, only seven examined risks at individual plants. Just five calculated and disclosed how future climate impacts could raise costs or hurt their earnings.",

      "Financing gaps in the power sector may be easier to close than those in water and sanitation, since energy projects can attract strong industry interest and investment, he said. But some countries daunted by demands from international investors for environmental safeguards might turn to regional financiers that are less scrupulous about such concerns.",
      "\u201cFor energy infrastructure, I see more hope that the financing gap can be closed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that can also come at a cost.\u201d",

      "ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Republicans in key battleground U.S. House districts are working to contain the political fallout that may come when thousands of their constituents face higher bills for health insurance coverage obtained through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "For a critical sliver of the Republican majority, the impending expiration of what are called enhanced premium tax credits after Dec. 31 is a pressing concern as they potentially face headwinds in a 2026 midterm election that will be critical to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "One of those is first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., whose victory for the Allentown-area seat last year was among the narrowest in the nation.",
      "Mackenzie is part of a bipartisan group that has been pressing for an eleventh-hour compromise, advocating for an extension of the tax credits that tries to fix perceived flaws and bring down health care costs. But the push is a long shot due to entrenched GOP opposition to the health overhaul known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we need to deal with the reality of where we are now and even if you have a broken system, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t provide or offer relief to individuals who are dealing with those high costs right now,\u201d Mackenzie said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Democrats have been laying the groundwork, starting with this fall's shutdown fight, to make the health care issue a focus of next year's campaigns.",
      "The party\u2019s strategy for capturing the House majority centers on pinning higher bills for groceries, health insurance and utilities on the policies of Trump and Republicans.",
      "In Washington, Republicans from competitive House districts have authored or signed onto bills that would temporarily extend the tax credits. A new bipartisan proposal unveiled Thursday has drawn support from roughly 15 Republicans and 20 Democrats so far.",
      "\u201cI have 40,000 people in my district who rely on this health care and doing nothing to prevent a spike in their premiums is wrong,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a sponsor of the plan.",
      "Thirteen Republicans \u2014 including Mackenzie \u2014 signed a letter in late October to the House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., encouraging the temporary extension of the tax credits, saying letting them \u201clapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.\u201d",
      "Johnson hasn't committed to a short-term extension vote before Jan. 1 and has dismissed the looming premium increases as affecting a small percentage of Americans.",
      "More than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, including farmers, business owners and other self-employed people who don\u2019t have other health insurance options through their work.",
      "Many benefit from subsidies that lower their out-of-pocket cost. Those subsidies include the enhanced premium tax credits, which were added and then extended under Democratic President Joe Biden when his party was the majority in Congress.",
      "Some Republicans \u2014 including Mackenzie \u2014 couch their support for an extension with the caveat that changes must be made. One is rooting out insurance broker fraud. Another is backing off subsidies for higher earners.",
      "U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, one of the California Republicans whose districts have been redrawn to favor a Democrat, sponsored a bill to extend the tax credits for two years. His bill would also impose an income eligibility cap to exclude higher earners.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office projects that 3.8 million more people will be uninsured in 2035 if the tax credits aren't extended. But the tax credits also come with a cost: Extending them would increase the deficit by $350 billion over the next decade.",
      "The expiration of the tax credits means enrollees will see annual premiums more than double \u2014 from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to health care research nonprofit KFF. That's an increase of 114%.",
      "The size of the increases varies by state, age and income and will be more extreme in Mackenzie\u2019s district, according to state data, which puts the average premium increase at 178%.",
      "A primary field of Democrats is shaping up for the nomination to challenge Mackenzie. They say they're hearing from people who are struggling to afford rising premiums.",
      "One of those Democrats, Ryan Crosswell, said rising insurance costs are a \u201cbreaking of promises\u201d by Trump, Republicans and Mackenzie. Another Democrat, Carol Obando-Derstine, called the impending expiration a \u201ccrisis of (Mackenzie's) own making.\u201d",
      "Mackenzie says he\u2019s made it clear repeatedly that he supports an extension, but that \u201cI am not the speaker, I don\u2019t set the calendar or the agenda. I\u2019m not the leader, I can\u2019t call up bills.\u201d",
      "In Mackenzie\u2019s district, more than 20,000 people received the enhanced tax credits in 2025, according to state data. He won his race last year by 1 percentage point, or about 4,000 votes.",
      "One of those 20,000 people in Mackenzie's district is Patrick Visconti, who switched to a low-premium, high-deductible plan because he couldn't afford to keep his plan with a premium that is more than doubling from under $200 to over $500 a month.",
      "Visconti, 59, who works as a self-employed landscaper and a bus driver, said the plan he picked is \u201ccrappy coverage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather pay the $200 a month. But I can\u2019t get anything for $200,\u201d Visconti said.",
      "Lynn Weidner, a home care worker in Mackenzie's district who works nearly 80 hours a week, said her $400 premium will increase to $680. But, she said, she's leaning toward selecting the plan because she has various conditions \u2014 including an iron deficiency \u2014 that require regular medical care.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m trying to find places where I can cut money so that I can afford my insurance come January, which is stressful,\u201d Weidner said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

      "Germany\u2019s parliament has approved a pension reform package that had prompted a rebellion in the ranks of Chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2019s party, the latest instalment in a bumpy first seven months in office",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's parliament on Friday approved a pension reform package that had prompted a rebellion in the ranks of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's party, the latest instalment of a bumpy first seven months in office.",
      "Lawmakers in the lower house voted 319-225 in favor of the package, including a measure that would hold the level of state pensions at 48% of average wages until 2031. There were 53 abstentions.",
      "A group of 18 young lawmakers in Merz\u2019s center-right Union bloc \u2014 a larger number than his coalition\u2019s parliamentary majority \u2014 had balked for weeks at a provision that said after 2031, the pension level would be slightly higher than under current law. They argued that that would cost up to 15 billion euros ($17.5 billion) per year, and that this would come at the expense of young people.",
      "Merz\u2019s junior coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, were adamant that the package be approved unchanged. Merz backed that.",
      "The measure to maintain the value of pensions was part of a package which also contains changes sought by Merz\u2019s conservative bloc, including a tax break that would make it easier for retirees to continue working.",
      "In an effort to assuage dissenters, coalition leaders stressed that a commission will produce proposals for a further-reaching reform of the pension system by mid-2026 as Germany, like many other countries, addresses the challenge of an aging population.",

      "The government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump's term in office ends. Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.",
      "\u201cWorking together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we\u2019ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public \u2014 and our hard-working air traffic controllers \u2014 deserve,\u201d Duffy said in the announcement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:",
      "Earlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "Duffy has said he'll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.",
      "This effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.",
      "The FAA hasn't yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.",
      "The technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation's aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.",
      "Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.",
      "The number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead. And drones will continue to proliferate across the country as flying taxis start to take to the air.",
      "Everyone agrees that the air traffic control system must be modernized to be able to handle those future demands.",
      "John Rose, chief risk adviser for global travel management company ALTOUR, said the three-year timeline is \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d but partially realistic. He said it\u2019s plausible for the FAA to build the foundation for a modern air traffic control network in its tight timeline, with more advanced capabilities layered on later.",
      "\u201cYou need to build the base before you can have all the bells and whistles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the project gets to the core structure in three years, I think we\u2019ve accomplished the mission.\u201d",
      "He likened it to an iPhone where once you have a robust base system you can upgrade the software like when the phone gets an iOS update. \u201cIf they build the infrastructure, then as things change from a technology capability, it\u2019s almost like a plug and play,\u201d he said.",
      "Air Traffic Control Association President and CEO Stephen Creamer represents the companies that make the gear that Peraton and the FAA will use to complete the upgrades. He said it helps that the new system won't have to be built from scratch.",

      "Duffy said that the FAA has already been working on making improvements and more than one-third of the old copper wires that air traffic controllers were relying on have been replaced with fiber optic lines or other modern connections.",
      "But some of the advancements like installing new systems to help controllers keep track of planes on the ground at 44 airports began during the last administration.",
      "And significant work remains ahead to install more than 27,600 new radios and 612 new radar systems. The old connections still need to upgraded at thousands of additional facilities, and six new air traffic control centers are scheduled to be built.",

      "Mario Cristobal reflects on his time with Nick Saban at Alabama, recalling a memorable lesson about making tough decisions in football",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Mario Cristobal spent four seasons working under Nick Saban at Alabama and learned countless lessons, some of which stand out more than others.",
      "And when thinking about the College Football Playoff, one of Saban's quotes from Cristobal's time as an assistant with him stood out.",
      "\u201c'If you want to make everybody happy, don\u2019t coach and get involved in football. Go sell ice cream because the ice cream man makes everybody happy,'\" Cristobal said, recalling the Saban line. \u201cIn football, not everybody\u2019s going to be happy.\u201d",
      "A year ago, at 10-2 and snubbed by the CFP committee, Miami wasn't happy.",
      "This year, at 10-2 and headed to Texas A&M for a playoff game, the Hurricanes are thrilled. It ultimately came down to an either-or pick for the last at-large spot, Miami or Notre Dame \u2014 and the committee had no choice but to finally recognize the Hurricanes' 27-24 season-opening win over the Fighting Irish.",
      "With that, Miami went to the playoff. Notre Dame's season ended; it passed on bowl invites, telling fans it would turn its focus toward winning a national title in 2026. And yes, the Hurricanes and Irish are scheduled to play at Notre Dame next November.",
      "\u201cNotre Dame's a great football team,\u201d Cristobal said. \"Processes like this ... all processes need to be assessed again and remedied wherever they can, but I think everybody\u2019s working at it. Last year we were excluded and we weren\u2019t very happy. It\u2019s a tough business, man. It\u2019s a really, really tough business. I respect everybody and everyone involved in it.\u201d",
      "The CFP selection committee was asked to re-watch the Notre Dame-Miami game in recent days, and committee chair Hunter Yurachek said things stood out.",
      "\u201cThere was observation from the coaches in the room where Notre Dame did a lot of chasing of some of the athletic receivers, especially on the Miami side, and it just felt like there was a little bit more athleticism on the side of Miami versus Notre Dame,\u201d Yurachek said. \u201cThen, the fact that Miami\u2019s defense really stifled Notre Dame\u2019s running game like nobody else did the entire season.\u201d",

      "Tweaks to the process are surely coming. Miami wound up losing a five-way tiebreaker for a berth in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game and the rules that the league operates under have been under some fire since. If that tiebreaker went Miami's way, it's entirely possible that the Hurricanes would have played their way in or out and Notre Dame would have had a playoff spot either way.",
      "Also befuddling to many: How Notre Dame could be ahead of Miami in every CFP ranking, but fall behind the Hurricanes at the end \u2014 after a weekend where neither club played. In short, the CFP committee said its prisms became different when looking solely at those two clubs for one spot and not as part of a larger group. That makes some sense, yet it's still easy to see why those on the wrong end of the decision could find it somewhere between confusing and flat-out wrong.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard job,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough industry, right? I mean, where else are so many variables so influential in the outcome of a game that could send teams in a death spiral or propel others to new heights? And you have human error, and you have officiating, and you have injuries and all that stuff. There's so much that goes into the game of football that when you also add a committee to make decisions, it's hard on everybody.\u201d",
      "Had the CFP not come calling, Miami probably would have been settling for a berth in the Gator Bowl. For many players who'll look at the 2026 NFL draft, the bowl probably would have been one to skip \u2014 and that would have conceivably meant the end of the college careers for players like Carson Beck, Rueben Bain Jr., Akheem Mesidor, CJ Daniels and more. That's not a new concept for college football; bowl games are often very watered-down right now when teams miss the CFP.",
      "\u201cI know one thing: The passion behind college football is at an all-time high,\" Cristobal said. \"And the part I\u2019m most happy about in terms of the process is that we didn\u2019t compromise winning on the field. Because with all the chaos in college football right now, all the uncertainty, college football has been hurled into a different galaxy. Coaches are taking jobs, but they have to fly back to be able to coach their teams for the current job. With all this going on, I\u2019m glad that we didn\u2019t punish the student athletes who actually laid it on the line \u2014 on the field.\u201d",

Just so much respect.\u201d",
      "Jones dropped to the ground after throwing incomplete and immediately grabbed the back of his right leg. He slammed his helmet to the ground several times before team trainers arrived. He eventually limped off the field and into the locker room for tests. The Colts quickly ruled him out.",

      "Ertz was carted off the field with what the Commanders feared was a torn ACL. Meanwhile, Quinn kept Daniels on the sideline down 17-0 to protect him while backup Marcus Mariota finished Washington\u2019s eighth straight loss.",
      "\u201cHe was questionable to return and could have,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cIt was my decision to sit him out. We were off as a team, and I felt that it was the right call.\u201d",

      "He tried to hit wideout Terry McLaurin with a quick pass toward the left sideline. But Vikings edge rusher Andrew Van Ginkel jumped in front of the ball and secured the deflection for an interception and 40-yard return.",
      "During the runback, Minnesota cornerback Isaiah Rodgers delivered a clean block on Daniels, knocking the quarterback off balance at midfield, where he landed hard on his left arm.",

      "\u201c I\u2019m useless, absolutely useless,\u201d Hamilton told British broadcaster Sky Sports after a disappointing qualifying session at the Hungarian GP in early August. \u201cThe team have no problem. You\u2019ve seen (Leclerc's) on pole. So they probably need to change driver.\u201d",

      "The 28-7 loss was a major boost to the hopes of Notre Dame and Miami, both of which went into the weekend on the playoff bubble with no chance to improve their resumes before the selection committee chooses the 12-team field on Sunday.",
      "While the committee will likely be reluctant to penalize a team that played an extra game \u2014 while surefire SEC playoff teams such as Texas A&M, Ole Miss and Oklahoma all watched from the comfort of home \u2014 the Tide's showing was so putrid over the first three quarters that it figures to be a restless night for coach Kalen DeBoer and his players.",
      "Not that DeBoer was willing to concede the point.",
      "He made it clear he considers the Tide (10-3, No. 9 CFP) a playoff team, no matter the outcome against Georgia (12-1, No. 3 CFP).",
      "\u201cIf this game applies to and takes away from our resume, I don't think that's right. I really don't,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cThe precedent has been set. I don't know how you can go into a conference playoff game as the No. 1 seed, where you've done all these things throughout the year and playing in this game \u2014 against one of the top teams in the country, as well \u2014 can hurt you and keep you out of the playoff.\"",
      "With Jam Miller sidelined by a lower leg injury, Alabama couldn't muster any semblance of a running game against a Georgia team it defeated 24-21 in Athens during the regular season. The Tide finished with minus-3 rushing yards and held the ball for just 23 minutes.",
      "Trailing 21-0 and having barely cleared 100 yards of total offense, the Tide finally showed signs of life in the final period with a nine-play, 91-yard drive for their lone touchdown. But Ty Simpson's short throw that Germie Bernard turned into a 23-yard score was the only glimmer on a dark day in Atlanta.",
      "When Alabama got the ball back deep in its own territory, DeBoer left the offense on the field for a fourth-and-2 play from the 12 \u2014 even with more than eight minutes still to play and all three of his timeouts.",
      "Fittingly, Simpson's sideline pass sailed far over the head of his intended receiver, and Georgia quickly finished off the victory with Zachariah Branch's 13-yard catch-and-run for a TD.",
      "\u201cWe know we're the best offense in the country,\u201d said Simpson, who completed 19 of 39 passes for 212 yards with an interception. \u201cWhen we don't show it, it's frustrating.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we're really worried about the score, we probably would've punted,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cBut we're here to win an SEC championship. If you lose by one or you lose by more, it's still a loss. That's what I cared about. You can't worry how much you lose by. We're here to win. That's how we play.\u201d",

      "But the Tide also have the worst loss among the bubble teams, a 31-17 defeat by Florida State in the season opener \u2014 a result from more than three months ago that could come back to haunt Alabama in December. The Seminoles won just four more games to finish 5-7.",
      "If DeBoer misses the expanded playoffs for the second straight year since taking over for Nick Saban, it's sure to raise the heat on the 51-year-old coach.",

      "But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project \u2014 switched on last week\u2014 is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent\u2019s northernmost city of more than 1 million people.",
      "A former chair of Axon\u2019s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he\u2019s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there\u2019s some clear indication of the benefits,\u201d said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University.",
      "Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but \u201cearly-stage field research\u201d that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly.",
      "\u201cBy testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post.",
      "The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a \u201cflag or caution\u201d for categories such as \u201cviolent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,\u201d said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to make sure that it\u2019s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,\" said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon\u2019s director of responsible AI.",
      "If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
      "Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has \u201cintentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.\" It didn't rule out using it in the future.",
      "The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints.",
      "While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police.",
      "Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn't match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots.",
      "Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump's administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI.",
      "The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.",
      "But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country.",
      "Many details about Edmonton's pilot haven't been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn't make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses.",

      "Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won't know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there's a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said.",

      "University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he's not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments.",

      "Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public.",
      "Axon has faced blowback for its technology deployments in the past, as in 2022, when Friedman and seven other members of Axon's AI ethics board resigned in protest over concerns about a Taser-equipped drone.",

      "But Axon acknowledged in a statement to the AP that all facial recognition systems are affected by \"factors like distance, lighting and angle, which can disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.\u201d",
      "Every match requires human review, Axon said, and part of its testing is also \u201clearning what training and oversight human reviewers must have to mitigate known risks.\u201d",

      "The science museum in Golden Gate Park is popular with Bay Area school children and international tourists, and many kids over the years have ended their visits clutching a mini Claude stuffed animal to take home. As an unofficial mascot of the museum and the city, Claude appeared in a children's book and in ads at bus and light-rail stations.",
      "The alligator icon had a \u201cquiet charisma\u201d that captivated hearts in his 17 years in San Francisco, the museum said in a statement. It has also said there are fewer than 200 albino alligators in the world.",
      "\u201cClaude showed us the power of ambassador animals to connect people to nature and stoke curiosity to learn more about the world around us,\" it said.",
      "Claude hatched in 1995 at an alligator farm in Louisiana, and came to live at the Academy in 2008. He was born with albinism, a genetic mutation that made him appear white. His eyes looked pinkish-red because of blood vessels that were visible through his clear irises.",

      "A baby and his family dog sit across from each other in a podcast studio.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the talking baby podcast,\u201d says the infant, wearing headphones and sounding like a deep-voiced radio broadcaster. \u201cOn today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll be talking to the weird-looking person who lives at my house.\u201d",
      "So begins a series of humorous interactions between two characters animated by artificial intelligence that's attracted millions of views on social media. They\u2019re a nod to the 1989 movie \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking\u201d but produced in a matter of hours and without a multimillion-dollar Hollywood budget.",
      "AI helped do all of that, but it didn't craft the punch lines. It\u2019s a relief to comedian Jon Lajoie, who made the videos, that AI chatbots just aren\u2019t \u201cinherently funny.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can't write comedy,\u201d said Lajoie. \u201cIt can't do any of that.\u201d",

      "King Willonius is not feeling so cautious. His first big hit was an AI-generated song called \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d that made fun of rapper Drake during the height of his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He's since moved into making AI video parodies like \u201cI\u2019m McLovin It (Popeye\u2019s Diss Song)\u201d and \u201cI Want My Barrel Back (Cracker Barrel song).\u201d",

      "He starts with writing his own notes on an idea, then refines it with a chatbot, and puts that language \u2014 known as a prompt \u2014 into AI tools that can generate imagery, video, music and voices. The key, he says, is to keep iterating.",

      "\u201cIt does seem fluent in the basic grammar of jokes, but sometimes they\u2019re slightly off,\u201d said Robinson, a professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThey may be moderately funny, but I think they\u2019re really missing an important element of what makes us laugh.\u201d",
      "What are they missing? She's not totally sure, except that most good jokes are a little edgy or dangerous and chatbots can't seem to calibrate \u201cwhatever provocation is in the joke to the moment that we\u2019re living in.\u201d",

And once the writers' strike happened, that kind of shut that down. I started to learn these AI tools and get really good at them and started to cultivate an audience.\u201d",

Instead, he found it useful to cheaply animate ideas he would otherwise never have pursued \u2014 such as the talking baby, birds wearing jeans, or a podcasting Jesus Christ interviewing an Easter Bunny who\u2019s never heard of him.",
      "The prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invited Lajoie and Willonius to exhibit their video creations this fall at a new AI gallery space in Manhattan, part of a promotion of AI creativity tool startups that the firm invests in.",
      "Willonius obliged. Lajoie ended up bowing out, after an interview with The Associated Press in which he voiced doubts about what he described as AI's \u201cNapster phase.\u201d The music-sharing website shuttered in the early 2000s after the record industry and rock band Metallica sued over copyright violations.",
      "The investment firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been bullish about AI's potential to bring new life into filmmaking and comedy. On a November podcast, he blamed Hollywood opposition to its adoption on \u201cwoke activists (who) have picked up AI as the new thing they\u2019re going to agitate about.\u201d He compared it to resistance to computer graphics in movies before they became commonplace.",
      "Lajoie said he shared his early AI video experiments with a few friends who are \u201canti-AI; real, real, anti-AI\u201d and they were surprised by how well the sketches retained Lajoie's own comedic voice.",
      "He insists he's no AI expert, just \u201ca creative person who can figure out how to make two characters talk to each other.\u201d But even editing the sketches requires understanding comedic timing, and he has no interest in ceding that part to a machine.",
      "\u201cThe thing with comedy is it\u2019s so related to performance, delivery and point of view,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cDo AIs have a point of view? They can grab a few points of view from different people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when it does have a point of view, I think that\u2019s when we all should be afraid for all of the reasons that the Terminator has taught us,\u201d he said.",

      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.",

      "Max Kotz, one of the study\u2019s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.",

      "Part of the enduring popularity of the PlayStation has been its ability to evolve with the technology, starting in 1995 by picking CD-ROMs that opened the door to 3D gaming. At the time, clunky cartridges were king.",
      "The PlayStation \u2014 sparked by a failed partnership between Nintendo and Sony \u2014 entered a marketplace dominated by Sega and Nintendo. Sony wanted to bring the arcade experience home and a crucial decision was to consult with game developers first, before building their system.",

      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",
      "\"We encourage trust in the country\u2019s institutional strength, which for decades has guaranteed certainty and environmental protection for multiple productive sectors,\" the company said.",

      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is making the rounds in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met separately with President Donald Trump and Republican senators Wednesday as tech executives work to secure favorable federal policies for the artificial intelligence industry, including the limited sale of Nvidia's highly valued computer chips to U.S. rivals like China.",
      "Huang's closed-door meeting with Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee came at a moment of intensifying lobbying, soaring investments and audacious forecasts by major tech companies about AI\u2019s potential transformative effects.",
      "Huang is among the Silicon Valley executives who warn that any restrictions on the technology will halt its advancement despite mounting concerns among policymakers and the public about AI's potential pitfalls or the ways foreign rivals like China may use American hardware.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\u201d Huang told reporters before his meeting on Capitol Hill.",
      "He added that he shared concerns about selling AI chips to China but believed that restrictions haven't slowed Chinese advancement in the AI race.",
      "\u201cWe need to be able to compete around the world. The one thing we can\u2019t do is we can\u2019t degrade the chips that we sell to China. They won\u2019t accept that. There\u2019s a reason why they wouldn\u2019t accept that, and so we should offer the most competitive chips we can to the Chinese market,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang also said he\u2019d met with Trump earlier Wednesday and discussed export controls for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Huang added that he wished the president \u201ca happy holidays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration in May reversed Biden-era restrictions that had prevented Nvidia and other chipmakers from exporting their chips to a wide range of countries. The White House in August also announced an unusual deal that would allow Nvidia and another U.S. chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices, to sell their chips in the Chinese market but would require the U.S. government to take a 15% cut of the sales.",
      "The deal divided lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad support for controls on AI exports.",
      "Members of Congress have generally considered the sale of high-end AI chips to China to be a national security risk. China is the main competitor to the U.S. in the race to develop artificial superintelligence. Lawmakers have also proposed a flurry of bills this year to regulate AI's impact on dozens of industries, though none have become law.",
      "Most Republican senators who attended the meeting with Huang declined to discuss their conversations. But a handful described the meeting as positive and productive.",

      "\u201cFor me, this is a very healthy discussion to have,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. Rounds said lawmakers had a \u201cgeneral discussion\" with Huang about the state of AI and said senators were still open to a wide range of policies.",
      "Asked whether he believed Nvidia's interests and goals were fully aligned with U.S. national security, Rounds replied: \u201cThey currently do not sell chips in China. And they understand that they\u2019re an American company. They want to be able to compete around the rest of the world. They\u2019d love to some time be able to compete in China again, but they recognize that export controls are important as well for our own national security.\"",
      "Other Republicans were more skeptical of Huang's message.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who sits on the upper chamber's Banking Committee, said he skipped the meeting entirely.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider him to be an objective, credible source about whether we should be selling chips to China,\u201d Kennedy told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got more money than the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and he wants even more. I don\u2019t blame you for that, but if I\u2019m looking for someone to give me objective advice about whether we should make our technology available to China, he's not it.\"",
      "Some Democrats, shut out from the meeting altogether, expressed frustration at Huang's presence on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cEvidently, he wants to go lobby Republicans in secret rather than explain himself,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "Warren added that she wanted Huang to testify in a public congressional hearing and answer \u201cquestions about why his company wants to favor Chinese manufacturers over American companies that need access to those high-quality chips.\u201d",

That order also clashed with policies of companies like U.S.-based Apple, which prohibits preinstalling third-party apps on its devices, including those developed by governments.",
      "The ministry said in a statement Wednesday that 600,000 new users had registered to download the app in the last day. While noting its increased acceptance, it said the government \u201chas decided not to make the preinstallation mandatory for mobile manufacturers.\u201d",

      "Indiana state senators are gathering in Indianapolis to finally weigh in on mid-cycle redistricting",
      "A proposal to redraw Indiana's congressional boundaries faces its first public test in the state Senate on Monday, with no clarity on whether it can pass a final vote later in the week despite months of pressure from President Donald Trump.",
      "Senators will take action on a bill designed to favor GOP candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. However, many Republicans, who control the chamber, have been hesitant or even outright opposed to the idea of mid-decade redistricting. Several have also been threatened over their opposition or unwillingness to immediately declare support.",
      "Their deciding votes could test Trump's typically iron grip on the Republican Party. Monday's expected committee hearing could give a first glimpse at how many senators plan to go on record against the bid to consolidate power in the staunchly conservative state.",
      "The map introduced just last Monday and passed by the Republican super majority in the state House on Friday splits the city of Indianapolis into four districts, distributed across other Republican-leaning areas. It also groups the cities of East Chicago and Gary with a wide swath of rural counties in northern Indiana.",
      "The contours would eliminate the districts of the state's two Democratic congressional representatives: longtime Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, representing Indianapolis, and Rep. Frank Mrvan, representing northwest Indiana near Chicago. Carson is the state's only Black member of Congress.",
      "Republicans currently hold seven of the state's nine districts.",
      "Democrats are hoping to flip control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections and like their odds, since midterms tend to favor the party opposite the one in power.",
      "Redistricting is typically done once a decade following the census. But Trump has pushed Republican-led states to squeeze out more districts winnable for Republicans as a result. Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina have followed suit, while Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to draw their own favorable districts in response.",
      "But the idea of redrawing a congressional map last approved in 2021 has made many Republicans in Indiana uneasy, particularly in the Senate. The leader of the state Senate previously said there were not enough votes in support of redistricting. But where the vote count stands going into Monday is unknown.",
      "Senators are scheduled to meet on the floor at 12:30 p.m., and the Senate elections committee is scheduled to meet at 1:30 p.m.",
      "The White House has upped the pressure on Indiana. Vice President JD Vance visited Indianapolis twice since August, and legislative leaders met with Trump in the Oval Office earlier this year.",

      "In the weeks following, about a dozen state lawmakers were the victims of threats and swatting, in which a hoax call is made to police to elicit a law enforcement response, typically to someone's home.",
      "In the 50-person Senate chamber, redistricting proponents need at least 25 \u201cyes\u201d votes to give final passage to the map. That would trigger a tiebreaking vote from Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who is in favor of redistricting.",
      "If the Senate were to vote against the new map, it would be extremely difficult for proponents to try again. The deadline to file to run for Congress in Indiana is in early February, and primary elections are held in early May.",

      "Smith, appointed in 2023, had been brought in to stabilize a department facing staffing shortages and a city shaken by post-pandemic crime. But her tenure unfolded amid a fierce battle over authority, as Trump asserted federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department and deployed National Guard troops and federal agents alongside the city\u2019s officers.",

      "Early the next year, the city began to see improvement. Overall crime fell by about 17% in the first ten weeks of 2024, a drop Smith attributed to the new law and to targeted deployments in neighborhoods experiencing repeated trouble. She also imposed temporary youth curfew zones in several parts of the district.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sylvester Stallone, Kiss and Gloria Gaynor are among the luminaries being celebrated Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with Donald Trump hosting the show, the first time a president will command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as \u201cwoke\u201d anti-American culture.",
      "Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. The Republican president said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \u201cat the request of a certain television network.\u201d He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be something that I believe, and I\u2019m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they\u2019ve ever done and they\u2019ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there\u2019s nothing like what\u2019s going to happen\" on Sunday night, Trump said.",
      "Trump is assuming a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian and Trump nemesis Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cRambo\u201d movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \u201cI Will Survive\u201d and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and fire. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "The ceremony is expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band\u2019s original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall.",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center\u2019s programming and the building\u2019s appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \u201cTrump Kennedy Center.\u201d He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face to face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",

      "Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington have sued to get their jobs back",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington sued Monday to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.",
      "The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Director Kash Patel because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with President Donald Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on June 4, 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.",
      "The lawsuit says the agents were assigned to patrol the nation's capital during a period of civil unrest prompted by Floyd's death. Lacking protective gear or extensive training in crowd control, the agents became outnumbered by hostile crowds they encountered and decided to kneel to the ground in hopes of defusing the tension, the lawsuit said. The tactic worked, the lawsuit asserts \u2014 the crowds dispersed, no shots were fired and the agents \u201csaved American lives\" that day.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs were performing their duties as FBI Special Agents, employing reasonable de-escalation to prevent a potentially deadly confrontation with American citizens: a Washington Massacre that could have rivaled the Boston Massacre in 1770,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit in federal court in Washington represents the latest court challenge to a personnel purge that has roiled the FBI, targeting both top-ranking supervisors and line agents, as Patel has worked to reshape the nation's premier law enforcement agency. Besides the kneeling agents, other employees pushed out in recent months have worked on investigations involving Trump or his allies and in one case displayed an LGBTQ+ flag in his workspace.",
      "After photographs emerged of the agents taking a knee, the FBI conducted an internal review, with the then-deputy director determining that the agents had no political motive and should not be punished. The Justice Department inspector general reached a similar conclusion and faulted the department for having put the agents in a precarious situation that day, the lawsuit says.",
      "It was only after Patel took over the bureau in February that the FBI took a different posture.",
      "Multiple kneeling agents were removed from supervisory positions last spring and a fresh disciplinary inquiry was launched that resulted in the agents being interviewed about their actions. That internal process was still pending when the agents in September received terse letters telling them they were being terminated because of \u201cunprofessional conduct and a lack of impartiality in carrying out duties, leading to the political weaponization of government.\u201d",

      "The plaintiffs are among 22 agents from different squads across Washington who were deployed to downtown D.C. on June 4, 2020 to demonstrate a visible law enforcement process during a time of protests in the nation's capital and across the country.",
      "The lawsuit asserts that the agents were thrust into a chaotic scene, saying that a crowd recognized them as being from the FBI and \u201cintentionally\u201d pushed toward them, becoming \u201cincreasingly agitated\" and shouting and gesturing toward them. Some in the crowd began chanting \u201ctake a knee,\u201d a gesture that at that point was widely recognized as a sign of solidarity with Floyd, who was pinned to the pavement by police with a knee on his neck.",
      "The agents closest to the crowd were the first to kneel. After the crowd's attention turned to the other agents who remained standing, the other FBI employees followed suit, taking a knee in recognition that it was the \u201cmost tactically sound means to prevent violence and to maintain order.\u201d The crowd moved on.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs demonstrated tactical intelligence in choosing between deadly force\u2014the only force available to them as a practical matter, given their lack of adequate crowd control equipment\u2014and a less-than-lethal response that would save lives and keep order.,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThe Special Agents selected the option that prevented casualties while maintaining their law enforcement mission. Each Plaintiff kneeled for apolitical tactical reasons to defuse a volatile situation, not as an expressive political act.\u201d",
      "In addition to seeking reinstatement, the lawsuit also asks for a court judgment declaring the firings as unconstitutional, backpay and other monetary damages and an expungement of personnel files related to the terminations.",

      "It wasn't always this way. The bayou was once shallower and just wide enough for a small boat to pass. Land that cattle once roamed is submerged now, and elders tell stories of tree canopies once so lush they nearly shut out the day.",
      "The delicate lattice of Louisiana's coastline has been steadily retreating for generations. As it does, the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and other Indigenous people are fighting to protect what's left and to adapt to their changing environment. That includes a painstaking effort to build makeshift reefs that slow erosion and sturdier homes and buildings to better withstand storms.",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to make it so that people can stay here for as long as possible, for as long as they want to stay,\u201d said Matherne, who as the tribe's director of daily operations helped coordinate its response to the erosion threat.",

Isle de Jean Charles \u2014 their island home southwest of New Orleans \u2014 has lost 98% of its land.",
      "Louisiana's coast has been steadily retreating for several reasons.",
      "Levees along the Mississippi River have severed the natural flow of land-creating sand, silt and clay, starving wetlands of sediment they need to survive. Canals have allowed saltwater to flow into wetlands, killing freshwater vegetation that holds them together and accelerating erosion. Groundwater pumping is causing land to sink, and planet-warming emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are fueling hurricanes and accelerating sea level rise.",
      "Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land \u2014 sometimes fast, sometimes slow. A U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that when erosion was at its worst, a football field's worth of coastal wetlands was disappearing every 34 minutes.",
      "It\u2019s a difficult problem to solve without being able to count on the Mississippi River to periodically drop sediment to maintain the land, said Sam Bentley, geology professor at Louisiana State University.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to displace ecosystems, it\u2019s going to displace communities, it\u2019s going to isolate infrastructure that\u2019s along the coastline,\" Bentley said. \"And there are going to be a lot of changes that are very hard to deal with.\u201d",
      "Indigenous burial and cultural sites risk eroding, and traditional ways of life \u2014 shrimping, fishing and subsistence farming \u2014 are under pressure. Without action, researchers estimate the state could lose up to 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) \u2014 an area larger than Delaware \u2014 over the next 50 years.",
      "Reefs built from oyster shells are one attempt to stem the erosion.",
      "The oysters are collected from restaurants, stuffed into bags and stacked just off shore to form the reefs. The program, launched in 2014 by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, has recycled more than 16 million pounds (7.3 million kilograms) of shells in that time. That's enough to protect about 1.5 miles (about 2.4 kilometers) of shoreline.",
      "Since the Pointe-au-Chien tribe had a 400-foot (123-meter) reef built in 2019 to protect a historic mound, the coalition has measured a 50% reduction in the rate of land loss where the reefs were built, said coalition spokesman James Karst.",
      "But there are limits to what reclaimed oyster shells can do. There just aren't enough shells for Louisiana's estimated 7,721-mile (12,426 kilometer) coastline, said Karst, and moving them is expensive, so they have to be strategic. Many reefs they've built protect sites of cultural importance. They're also limited to areas where the water is salty enough for the oyster shells to last.",
      "Their work might seem like a tiny drop in the bucket, \"but when you are losing land at the rate you are,\u201d Karst said, \u201cyou need all the drops in the bucket you can get.\u201d",

      "The Association of American Railroads trade group asked for the relief from inspection requirements that were written back in 1971 because railroads believe the automated track inspection technology they use today is so good at spotting problems early that human inspections aren't needed as frequently. They say that extended tests that BNSF and Norfolk Southern ran show that safety actually improved even when human inspections were reduced from twice a week to twice a month.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration didn't go quite that far in its decision, but the agency said railroads will be able to cut inspections down to only once a week under the approved waiver.",
      "The railroads had also asked for permission to have up to three days to repair defects identified by the automated inspections. But the Federal Railroad Administration said any serious defects in the tracks must be repaired immediately and all defects should be addressed within 24 hours.",
      "These automated inspection systems use an array of cameras and lasers installed either on a locomotive or on a railcar that can be pulled as part of a train to assess whether the tracks are moving out of alignment or shifting. But the union that represents track inspectors says the technology can\u2019t detect things like the rock underneath the track shifting, vegetation growing into the path of the trains, a crack in the rail or railroad ties rotting out. Plus, inspectors can spot a combination of small defects that might together derail a train where the machine might not register a problem, the union says.",
      "\u201cThis is everyday defects across the entire country that we find through visual inspections that cannot be detected by this machinery,\u201d Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union President Tony Cardwell said. \u201cAnd that technology is not there. It has been here for 30 years. It hasn\u2019t really advanced much at all. It\u2019s a glorified tape measure.\u201d",

But the union says that this automated inspection equipment should supplement \u2014 not replace \u2014 human inspections because reducing track inspections would increase the risk of derailments.",
      "The railroads counter that even if these systems can't see the ballast shifting under the tracks or the ties starting to rot, the system will notice the symptoms of those problems because the track geometry \u2014 basically the alignment of the tracks \u2014 will be affected when those things happen.",
      "\u201cWhat it is looking at is the ultimate performance. If those components are doing their job, then the track geometry is being maintained.

      "Over two years of testing, manual inspections detected only 0.01 defects per 100 miles, compared with the section of the railroad where the test was being run where the combination of the technology and reduced inspections found 4.54 defects per 100 miles.",

      "Cardwell and the union's safety director, Roy Morrison, think that's a bad idea. They said that one of the benefits of frequent inspections is that the inspectors become intimately familiar with their territories, which helps them spot subtle changes. If they aren't out on the tracks as often, it may be harder to spot problems, they said.",
      "\u201cA track inspector who\u2019s out on his mainline track twice a week, he knows that track inside out, and a lot of times he\u2019ll spot a defect without even knowing what he\u2019s looking at yet,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get out of the truck and say, hey, there\u2019s something wrong here.

      "Norfolk Southern said that during its 18-month test of reducing inspections while using the technology, the railroad saw improvements in areas that the automated system can't find because inspectors were free to spend more time focused on those areas.",

      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "Potential antitrust hurdle",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Paramount CEO David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The playful, graceful and surprising designs of architect Frank Gehry (Feb. 28, 1929-Dec. 5, 2025) changed the skylines of cities around the world, from Los Angeles, New York and Seattle to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Panama City. But he was never completely happy with his work. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022 what he saw when he looked at his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 a Los Angeles landmark whose massive curves fit together like puzzle pieces \u2014 Gehry replied, \"Well, I see what I would do different!\" What sounded like second guessing, Gehry called \"creative insecurity.\"",
      "Born Frank Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, he worked at his grandfather's hardware store, \"playing with the nails and the screws,\" he said. His father brought the family to Los Angeles in 1947, when Frank was 17. \"It just looked like a new world somehow; I was quite moved by it,\" he said.",
      "He fell in love with architecture, and, at the behest of his first wife, who was fearful of antisemitism, changed his last name to Gehry. He began incorporating industrial materials into his designs, but his ideas really took flight once he adapted software created for the aerospace industry. His buildings' flowing curves could now mimic movement.",
      "\"The movement is feeling,\" he said. \"And how do you get a big monster building to have any feeling? And the movement makes that happen. And I think that finding a way to build it was the issue.\" One humorous example: a tower in Prague, inspired by human forms gracefully entangled. The building was nicknamed \"Fred and Ginger.\"",
      "His Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, opened in 1997, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Gehry's aerospace software allowed for the precise calculations necessary to shape titanium into a curving exterior. \"When you go there, you see the light play with the building, especially on gray days when you really want some light, you want a feeling of warmth,\" Gehry said. \"All of a sudden, this metal glows beautifully.\"",
      "Among his other recognizable projects: The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany; the Peter B. Lewis Building in Cleveland; the Lou Ruvo Center in Las Vegas; the Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany; the LUMA Arles Tower in Arles, France; the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis; and the Stata Center in Cambridge, Mass.",
      "Gehry's challenge to architects: \"Think of people and how they're going be inspired by your work, and give them something to think about. That's what a painting does. That's what a sculpture does. And architecture is an art. So, why not?\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:06:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"Blue Moon\" talks about playing famed songwriter Lorenz Hart, whose successful collaboration with Richard Rodgers ended owing to Hart's heavy drinking; and about his own youthful ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a hundred years ago, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart helped put the \"great\" in the Great American Songbook, with songs like \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" and \"Blue Moon.\"",
      "But by the early 1940s, Hart's heavy drinking made him an unreliable partner. So, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II, and their first production, the landmark musical \"Oklahoma!\" opened at the St. James Theatre on March 31, 1943.",
      "It was an immediate hit, and that night there was a big party a few doors down at Sardi's, that legendary Broadway watering hole, with its walls hung with the caricatures of famous faces. Lorenz Hart showed up at Sardi's that night, and what happened next is now a movie.",
      "In \"Blue Moon,\" Ethan Hawke is Hart, drowning his sorrows at the bar.",
      "For the film, they re-created Sardi's on a soundstage, but \"Sunday Morning\" met Hawke at the real thing.",
      "\"I was definitely the type of young person that would walk in and think, 'When am I gonna get my painting up there?'\" he said. \"I'm not above that. I'm a little heartbroken that I don't have one up yet!\"",
      "Perhaps his time will come. \"My time's coming,\" he said. \"I have hope. I'm not done yet!\"",
      "And this performance is proof: the real Lorenz Hart was less than five feet tall, so director and frequent Hawke collaborator Richard Linklater used camera tricks to make the nearly six-foot actor look short. Hawke also shaved the top of his head to make a real combover, and he learned a mountain of dialogue.",
      "\"It's definitely the most text I've ever had in a movie,\" Hawke said. \"I remember calling my wife after the first day \u2013 I think I had more lines than I had in the previous five films.\"",
      "It was a challenge for an actor whose face usually says it all. In the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society,\" Hawke played a student, and he says he learned a lot from co-star Robin Williams. \"There's a scene where he's talking about how to grade poetry, and he has all the kids rip it out \u2013 I didn't realize how much I was being taught, and how that sustained me through negative criticism. It's like, there's not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead. So you don't like it? Suck an egg. You don't know what great acting is any more than I do.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you're in a movie like that so young, does it set you up? Or does it set you up?\"",
      "\"It's a great question, 'cause it's possibly both,\" he replied. \"If you let it be the high-water mark of your life, it will be, you know, if you put too much on that. You don't want anything at 18 to be the high-water mark of your life.\"",
      "Between movies, Hawke made his Broadway debut with, he says, a lot more confidence than skill. \"That's the weird thing about being young. I had no business being confident at anything. I was a total moron. And I walked in here like I was, you know, John Barrymore.\"",
      "His performance in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" (1992) was described as \"promising.\" But it was clear that his best work was ahead of him.",
      "Hawke got the first of four Oscar nominations for his role in the 2001 film \"Training Day\" opposite Denzel Washington. His performance still resonates. Hawke said, \"When my son was about six, Levon, he said to me, 'Dad, what's \"Training Day?\"' I said, 'Oh, it's the movie I did a few years ago. Why?' He said, \"'cause every time we walk down the street, when people pass you, they say, \"Training Day\"!'\"",
      "But after \"Training Day,\" there was a time when Hawke says he passed on more parts than he took \u2013 and the offers started drying up. \"When you're young, you think it's everybody. You don't realize that This is a young person's game, and those kinds of job offers, there's a shelf life on that.\"",
      "\"When did your shelf life, when did that hit?\" I asked.",
      "\"Around the same time gray starts appearing in your beard,\" he replied.",
      "The gray in the beard works for him now, as a hard-nosed investigative reporter in the critically-acclaimed FX series \"The Lowdown.\" In the series, you never know what's around the next corner \u2013 just as in real life. As we were wrapping up at Sardi's, owner Max Klimavicius suddenly showed up with a surprise for Hawke: \"Ethan, I would like your permission to make you part of our collection,\" he said.",
      "He was a bit stunned, and to be honest, so were we. But after Ethan Hawke's career on screen and stage, it wasn't all that surprising.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said. \"It finally happened. I've got my portrait at Sardi's. I've arrived! Things are looking up in this life!\"",
      "And now, with his latest film in mind, there's talk of more accolades to come.",
      "How does he handle the Oscar buzz surrounding \"Blue Moon\"? Does he tune it out? He said, \"There's the obvious other part of you that goes, like, 'Hey, I dedicated my life to this job, and this is seen as a barometer.' And I would be dishonest if I didn't say that, like, that would be amazing.",
      "\"This is so corny, but it just flashed through my head: I was like 11 or something, I said to my mother, 'What's gonna happen with my life? What's gonna happen?' And she \u2013 and I remember it so vividly \u2013 in the kitchen, like Doris Day [sings] 'When I was just a little girl\u2026' you know, it goes into 'Que Sera, Sera.'",
      "\"You have to have a little 'Que Sera, Sera.' I don't take any of it for granted. That's, I guess, the right answer. Any little bit of it.\"",

      "Author Peter Guralnick wrote the definitive two-volume biography of the King: \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley\" (1994), and \"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\" (2000). And now, his latest is about Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager. Asked if he found anything surprising, Guralnick replied, \"It totally surprised me.\"",
      "\"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.) is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
      "Guralnick says Parker did not create the template for being the manager of a musician: \"It wasn't original to him, it wasn't brand new. But he carried it, I think, to a far greater extent than anyone had before.\"",
      "In 1955, the 20-year-old Presley was playing the Louisiana Hayride when Parker first caught his act. \"It took no more than a few days after seeing him for the first time that he booked Elvis when nobody else was willing to book him,\" Guralnick said.",
      "Parker, who was then handling Hank Snow, quickly put Elvis in the show.",
      "Elvis would sell more than 12 million records in 1956. The Colonel negotiated his recording contract, his movie deal, and oversaw all his marketing.\u00a0 As he would write, \"I don't [just] sit here and smoke cigars hoping for something to happen.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"There is so much love in some of his early letters to Elvis. And in one he says, you know, 'You are just like me. You are sensitive, you're easily hurt. But only those we love can hurt us.'\"",
      "Presley would write back, \"I love you like a father.\"",
      "Colonel Tom Parker wasn't actually a colonel; he also wasn't American. In fact, Andreas van Kuijk was a stowaway from Holland, who arrived in the U.S. in 1926, barely speaking English. The 16-year-old soon invented an origin story. \"Once he declared himself to be Tom Parker, born in West Virginia, his identity was never questioned for over 50 years,\" said Guralnick. \"The only person who may have known it was Elvis Presley.\"",
      "The honorary title \"Colonel\" would be bestowed on him by Louisiana's Governor. It became his first name. \"That was how he signed all of his letters,\" said Guralnick.",
      "Before Presley, Parker made a star out of Eddy Arnold, booking him as the first \"hillbilly act\" in Vegas.",
      "Actor George Hamilton, who befriended the Colonel in his early days in Hollywood, said, \"He had all the smarts of a con man, but he wasn't. He knew how to make the other person want whatever he was selling.\"",
      "Asked why Parker was so driven, Hamilton replied, \"Emotional stuff from his childhood. I feel like he had some horrible damage done. He didn't like his father.\"",
      "Parker would become notorious for taking a 50% cut of some of Presley's later deals. \"Now, I sat with him one day and I said, 'Is it right to get half of everything?'\" Hamilton recalled. \"And he said, 'Well, you know, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.' And I said, 'Well, you mean your half, or his?' He said, 'Well, if I didn't have my half, he wouldn't have his!' And I got it. I got it.\"",
      "The Colonel offered Hamilton an opportunity in Vegas: \"He said, 'And by the way, Elvis has gotta take two weeks off at the Hilton. And I booked you in.' I said, 'I can't do that show. That doesn't make any sense, Colonel.' He said, 'George, you want $50,000 a week?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'It's two weeks. For that, you can do anything, can't you?' I said, 'Yes, sir!'\"",
      "In 1973, after Presley bad-mouthed hotel owner Conrad Hilton on stage in Vegas, Parker confronted him backstage. \"Essentially, Elvis and Colonel fired each other,\" said Guralnick.",
      "The split didn't last long. \"Neither Colonel nor Elvis could imagine a world without the other,\" said Guralnick. \"They simply didn't have the ability to walk away.\"",
      "But Parker began to worry about the \"instability of [his] artist.\"",
      "Asked how he reacted to Presley's increasing drug use, Guralnick replied, \"I think he was at a loss. I think there was an element of denial. But he was well aware of what was going on. Nobody could miss what was going on.\"",
      "In Vegas, Colonel developed his own addiction. George Hamilton saw it firsthand: \"He used to get me to go gambling with him. God! He would go all-in on, like, I mean, big money. I saw close to a million dollars lost at a table.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"They were caught in a trap \u2013 as Elvis sang! I mean, neither one of them could confront the other one with his problem.\"",
      "According to the author, the two were locked in a relationship of mutual denial \u2013 the twin tragedies of their story. And when Elvis died in 1977, the Colonel, according to Guralnick, \"went into shock.\"",
      "\"I'll never stop trying to keep nis name alive,\" Parker said. He would die in 1997.",
      "While Guralnick was doing research at Elvis' Memphis mansion Graceland, in what was once the office of Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, he was told the office telephone was disconnected: \"So, one night we were working quite late, and it was 10 o'clock at night. And all of a sudden, the phone rang. And so you know, you'll have to tell me: Was this Elvis? Was this Vernon? Maybe it was Colonel.",
      "\"We stared at it. Should we answer? Should we not answer? Who knows what would happen if we answered? But we did not answer. We just listened to it ring, until it finally stopped ringing!\"",
      "\"You wanted the idea that there was one of those three on the other end of the line?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, you want to preserve the mystery!\"",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "The Beginning of It All",
      "He first became aware of the boy in early 1955 through an old pal in Texarkana, Arkansas, a DJ, radio personality, and promoter named Ernest Hackworth who went by the name of Uncle Dudley. Hackworth, who, like so many other promoters, worked on his own shows as a country comedian, reported that this kid from Memphis had drawn more than eight hundred people to a little schoolhouse in New Boston, Texas, on January 11, which was a heckuva draw for an unknown artist whose name he usually got all jumbled up.",
      "Oddly enough, Colonel was later reminded, he had actually been told about the boy two months earlier by another old colleague, Oscar Davis, who was wont to say he had made several fortunes (true\u2014he had managed Hank Williams at the height of his career) and lost even more (equally true). Davis, a smooth-tongued, silver-haired operator who went back even further than Colonel in the world of carnivals and show business, was a peer- less pitchman, always immaculately dressed, always sharp as a tack\u2014in the view of a mutual acquaintance who did business with them both, he differed from Colonel in only two ways. Unlike Colonel, Oscar Davis looked the part, \"he looked like the man with the money\"\u2014 but also unlike Colonel (with whom you could operate with complete confidence on a handshake basis) you couldn't trust a word that he said.",
      "Oscar had hit a rough patch lately and was advancing an Eddy Arnold tour for Colonel when he met this Presley boy in Memphis and had even gone to see him perform at some little club where the kid had really gotten the audience worked up. But for one reason or another, it seemed like Oscar wasn't emphasizing the point too strongly, or maybe Colonel just wasn't listening that closely (with Oscar Davis, you didn't want to over-listen), so it wasn't until Uncle Dudley spoke to him the day after the New Boston show that he paid attention.",
      "This time there was no hesitation.",
      "He and Tom Diskin went to see Presley perform at the Louisiana Hayride three days later, and he was so knocked out, not so much by the music\u2014he really wasn't sure at first what to make of the music\u2014as by the reaction of the crowd, that he got in touch with Presley's manager, a Memphis DJ named Bob Neal, right away. Within a week he had him booked on the Hank Snow tour that was about to begin in New Mexico on February 14. Even before the start of the tour, apparently on the strength of the Hayride performance alone, Colonel approached Steve Sholes about signing him to RCA, but as it turned out, the head of Presley's little record label in Memphis, Sam Phillips, wouldn't hear of it, in fact he seemed almost insulted by the idea, so Colonel was forced to let Steve know that it looked like Presley was \"pretty securely tied up\" for the time being.",
      "From the very first dates on the New Mexico tour, the boy's talent\u2014not just his talent but his drive, and especially his capacity for growth\u2014were unmistakable. When asked some eighteen months later if he took credit for Elvis Presley's unparalleled success, the Colonel uncharacteristically demurred. \"I think Presley was a star from the first day he ever started going into show business,\" he said. \"I knew I could help him, [but] I think anyone could have helped him that knows something about show business.\"",
      "It was astounding, the speed with which it happened.",
      "Everywhere the Hank Snow\u2013headlined revue played, the clamor over Presley's performance only grew, and many nights he took the show. Hank Snow tried to hide his reaction, but Colonel could not help but be aware of it and all the ways his client's wounded vanity played out. The boy never seemed to notice, though; he clearly thought the world of Snow, and Colonel did all he could to smooth things over, pointing out that everywhere they went, they were breaking attendance records, which surely had to be considered a tribute to the star of the show.",
      "Things could not have been going better, in fact, for the new partnership between Colonel Tom Parker and Hank Snow. Record sales were up, and due to his assiduous efforts, Colonel never tired of reminding Snow, all sorts of new, high-paying opportunities in radio and television were starting to open up. The trades attributed these rapidly expanding horizons to a unique artist-manager relationship which Cash Box would describe as \"based on loyalty, mutual respect and a common objective,\" not to mention the uncommon efforts of Tom Parker, \"a colorful personality [with] a natural flair for showmanship [who is] known from coast to coast . . . and respected for his sound business principles [and his] policy of doing more than he has promised.\"",
      "But, tellingly, Colonel didn't book Elvis with Hank again until May, while Hank continued to do record-breaking business on his own.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks\u2014the principal stumbling block\u2014to his doing more with Presley was the boy's manager, Bob Neal, who seemed infuriatingly unsusceptible to persuasion, promotion, or even recognition of his own (let alone his artist's) ever-increasing opportunities. During a brief break from touring at the beginning of March, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin, clearly disheartened by his inability to make any headway with Neal. \"I don't see much use in wasting any [more] money or time on Presley till we know that they need us, and only when they contact us direct for help in some way.\" Things were slow in the business in general, he noted, but he had not given up on improving Hank's royalty situation with RCA, or maybe even moving him to his old friend Randy Wood's Dot label (though in all likelihood, here he was merely musing out loud, for his own and Tom Diskin's benefit, about something that would almost certainly have been little more than a negotiating ploy). Meanwhile, he thought he would set up another strong ten- or fifteen-day tour for Hank, \"keep getting special deals lined up,\" and focus on getting him another guest shot on TV with Perry Como.",
      "But as frustrated as he was by the Presley situation, he was not about to give up. Finally, on March 29, he was able to come to some sort of agreement with Bob Neal for a two-week series of one-nighters in Florida with Hank Snow, but he couldn't resist needling Neal while at the same time trying to steer him toward a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Neal had to pay more attention to business, he wrote with unfeigned indignation. He had to get the Colonel a complete supply of photos and records right away. And most important of all, the boy was never going to get anywhere so long as he was on Sun Records. \"I am finding out that in some places they have never heard of Elvis. . . . this I am not saying to knock, as you well know but to drive home the fact how sad it is that this boy does not get the spread he needs on his records.\" And when Neal failed at this task, as at every other, he wrote again\u2014and again.",
      "The Florida tour was a triumph beyond anything that could have been imagined.",
      "On the first date, in Daytona Beach on May 7, Mae Boren Axton, a forty-year-old high school English teacher and sometime songwriter from Jacksonville, who had been doing advance press work in the area for the Colonel for the last year or two, witnessed a kind of crowd reaction she had never seen before. A well-educated woman from a prominent political family in Oklahoma (her nephew David later became governor of the state and a three-term U.S. senator), she had grown up, she said, with \"no idea\" of what hillbilly music was, but she had come to like it from all the promotion work she had done for numerous hillbilly jamborees over the last few years. Now, in her capacity as Colonel's designated press officer, she undertook to conduct an interview with Elvis before the show, one of the first real interviews he had ever done, she imagined, judging from his polite, tongue-tied responses\u2014but then she was almost struck dumb herself by the altogether unexpected explosiveness of his act. At one point she ran across one of her former students while Elvis was still onstage, \"and she was just right into it, didn't know who he was, none of them did. But she was just ahhhh\u2014all of them were, even some of the old ones were doing like that. I looked at the faces\u2014they were loving it. And I said, 'Hey, honey, what is it about this kid?' And she said, 'Awww, Miz Axton, he's just a great big beautiful hunk of forbidden fruit.'\"",
      "In Orlando, four nights later, the crowd called for Elvis to come back when Hank Snow took the stage, and could not be quieted during Snow's performance. The reporter for the local paper, a complete neophyte to this kind of music (it provided \"a poignant contrast to Metropolitan Opera in Atlanta, I must say,\" she acknowledged to her readers), gave a reasonably enthusiastic account of the entire evening, \"but what really stole the show was this 20- year-old sensation, Elvis Presley, a real sex box as far as the teenage girls are concerned. They squealed themselves silly over this fellow in orange coat and sideburns who 'sent' them. . . . Following the program, Elvis was surrounded by girlies asking for autographs. He would give each a long, slow look with drooped eyelids and comply. They ate it up.\" Which evolved in the blink of an eye into a full-scale riot in Jacksonville, when, at the conclusion of his act, Elvis announced, \"Girls, I'll see you all backstage.\"",
      "\"I heard feet like a thundering herd,\" Mae Axton recalled, \"and the next thing I knew I heard this voice from the shower area, and Elvis was on top of one of the showers looking sheepish and scared, and his shirt was shredded and his coat was torn to pieces . . . he was up there with nothing but his pants on and they were trying to pull at them up on the shower.\" The Colonel, said Mae, \"and I don't mean it derogatorily, got dollar marks in his eyes.\"",
      "But I think even Mae would be willing to admit that this was a reductive picture of a man she had come to admire for both his intellect and determination. Because she could tell even then that from Colonel's perspective Elvis Presley was not just another passing fancy to be cashed in on and forgotten, he was, potentially, a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.",
      "Within days Colonel was hard at work trying to set up another Florida tour. Once again, Bob Neal's refusal, or simply inability, to take a businesslike approach was an obstacle, but one which Colonel was confident he could overcome. On May 25 he wrote to Neal in what could be taken as a lesson in coercive persuasion: \"I was most happy to do what I could to help Elvis and you in getting him across in these new markets. . . . I am always glad to work with both of you, I am not one of the type of personalities that tries to cut out a manager, as you well know a good many would do. . . . If ever you wish to tie in with me closely and let me carry the ball I will be happy to sit down with both of you and try to work it out.\" Evidently that must have struck a chord with Neal, who instantly initiated a phone call, which in turn prompted a second letter from Colonel, spelling out terms and conditions and laying out \"the protection I must have to enable [me] to tie these things up and not be fanning the air and spent my money foolish.\"",
      "He felt no need to mention it at the time, but the second Florida tour, scheduled to begin in just two months, would take place without the presence of Hank Snow. Snow instead would be heading up a West Coast tour of his own, his first all-out assault on that market, which would be operating under the direction of Tom Diskin and conclude with a triumphal appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Colonel made sure that Hank understood that he was not abdicating managerial responsibility, that every aspect of the tour would be plotted out by himself and Mr. Diskin, and that it would, of course, be fully supported by RCA. But in fact Hank couldn't have been more pleased, and if he were to be perfectly honest about it, he would not miss the presence of Presley in the least. And it wasn't as if he were losing anything on the deal. As a partner in Hank Snow Enterprises\u2013Jamboree Attractions, he stood only to gain by the addition of another big moneymaking tour in whose profits he would be a full participant.",
      "In the meantime, while fully engaged in the setup of both tours, Colonel continued to go back and forth with Bob Neal about the smallest, and largest, of matters. He dangled the promise of two weeks in Las Vegas (\"The [club] owner is a good friend of mine\"), which surely he would have had difficulty delivering on, but Neal didn't bite. He continued to hector Neal about his inattention to business (\"I have been waiting to hear from you,\" again, and again, and again), without any tangible results. Finally, he arranged to meet with Neal in person about a whole panoply of issues, including, once again, trying to shop Presley's record contract to a major label, about which he believed they had finally reached agreement, only to hear back from Neal three days later: \"Hold off any further announcements regarding Elvis until I have more time with him.\"",
      "On June 25, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin in what appears to be barely concealed, barely punctuated frustration. \"Get it in your mind that there is no future in anything but big deals, no small time stuff it takes as much time and no money can be made of it. You have to believe this so strongly that you will let no one get your time and ear on junk deals. Everytime we have become involved in something small [and here it is hard to believe that he is not for the first time wondering if this is how the whole Elvis experience will turn out] we have lost time money and get nowhere.\"",
      "Just how discouraged he must have been feeling is evident in the entirely unaccustomed rush of emotion that he pours into what he writes next to Diskin, with whom he has been working in perfect harmony for three years now without ever once communicating just how much the younger man's contributions have meant to him. \"The future looks very good for you if you want to make it that way,\" he writes, in a passage posing as well-meant advice for a junior partner who needs bucking up, but which could just as easily be taken as a confidence-building message to Colonel himself. \"I will always protect you all I can/and I know you do the same. You are good for me and I know that I do understand you better than any-one could. Your closer to me than any-one ever has been and will be. and I know you understand me.\"",
      "The return to Florida, beginning on July 25 and ending seven days later with a benefit show in Tampa sponsored by the Sertoma Club and Clyde Rinaldi, proved to be even more spectacular than the first tour. The all-star cast was headlined by comedian-actor Andy Griffith, but it was Elvis who took the show every night, astonishing not only the audience but his fellow performers. Once again there was a riot in Jacksonville in the course of which Elvis once again had his clothes torn off, something the Colonel made sure to mention two weeks later in an exhortatory letter to Sam Weisbord, one of William Morris' most senior West Coast agents.",
      "He was enclosing a set of action pictures he had had taken in Tampa, he wrote to Weisbord. (One of them would become the arresting cover of Elvis' first RCA album some eight months later.) He was also enclosing a selection of his records. \"He is presently on a small record label and they have sold this year over 100,000 of this boy's records already, and they have no distribution whatsoever. . . . This artist seems to me to be right in line for motion picture material, television, and a stage career. . . . With the right training and advice and good material the possibilities are unlimited. His exposure on the stage does 75% towards the public accepting this artist. The talents that are hidden in this personality are unlimited.\"",
      "He didn't hesitate to invoke Hank Snow, another well-regarded William Morris client, who \"has done much to expose the talents of ELVIS PRESLEY, as he has taken him more or less under his wing and has been plugging away on all his personals and blowing the bugle about ELVIS PRESLEY.\"",
      "And he summed it all up on a not altogether unexpected note. \"I can only go so far without the help of friends like you towards making the world aware of such great talent. You have forgotten more than I'll ever know about how to bring this out in an artist and I'm asking you for advice to carry on and get the best results out of and for ELVIS PRESLEY and all of us.\"",
      "He copied the letter to Harry Kalcheim, the head of William Morris' New York office, who had been instrumental in helping to broaden Eddy Arnold's appeal with key supper-club and television bookings. And he continued to bombard Steve Sholes at RCA with letters and telegrams, ostensibly under the guise of tipping him off to something that Colonel was good enough not to want him to miss.",
      "This might all be taken as Colonel's usual method of operation, of course\u2014and in many respects it was. But the lack of caution, the abandonment of all of his usual, carefully calibrated reserve, was something new. Certainly he had felt the same kind of full-blown belief in Eddy Arnold and the vast potential of his talent\u2014but he had always proceeded with an element of circumspection, taking each incremental step only after he was confident of the success of the last. With Presley he was making no such allowance for failure. If the boy failed, he was leaving himself nothing to fall back on. Because here it was not just Elvis Presley's musical talent that foretold an almost limitless future (though that may well have been enough in itself), it was his spongelike ability to absorb and reshape everything that he took in and experienced, his seemingly inexhaustible appetite for self-improvement. As Colonel would one day remark in comparing Presley's talent with that of Gene Austin, his first superstar, both were \"individual artists [who] have a feeling inside them for what they are doing which you can't teach anyone.\" And as he was quick to point out with more than just a smidgen of irony, \"I, as a salesman and drummer, know this [better] than the average guy.\"",

      "New York Times bestselling author Jan Karon returns to the village of Mitford in her 15th novel featuring Father Tim Kavanagh, \"My Beloved\" (G.P. Putnam's Sons).",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Father Kavanagh",
      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "summary": "The bestselling author had said she would no longer write novels set in the make-believe mountain village of Mitford. After the death of her daughter, she wrote through her grief \u2013 which led to her 15th Mitford book, \"My Beloved.\"",
    "story": [
      "For one weekend only, hundreds of devoted readers gathered in Hudson, North Carolina, to celebrate Mitford, a fictional place with a real sense of community. Jan Karon, the 88-year-old author behind Mitford, has written 15 books about the make-believe mountain village.",
      "Asked how to describe the town of Mitford, Karon said it is \"a place my readers can go and not be afraid. It's a place of refuge. It's where they can go, get a deep breath.\"",
      "The humanity of Karon's characters has found a faithful following that's perennially put her novels on the bestseller list. But for some people, she's not a household name like other bestselling authors. Asked why, Karon said, \"I don't give you much of a ride. I just give you sort of a float! A lot of people tell me that my books put them to sleep, and I consider that a huge compliment!\"",
      "Karon's super-fans say the books are more than page turners. According to Nellie McMasters, \"We are in such an uncertain period, we're in such turmoil, that it's just a nice, pleasant place.\"",
      "\"And it's not divisive,\" said Joellen Maurer. \"This is just love your neighbor, know the people who live around you.\"",
      "Asked if she believes places like Mitford exist in America today, Phyllis Farringer replied, \"They do, where there's a community of faith and people caring about each other, and I see it.\"",
      "Jan Karon was raised by her grandmother, Fannie, in Hudson, and attended elementary school there. Almost eight decades later, she converted the site to the Mitford Museum.",
      "She credits her first grade teacher Nan Downs with encouraging her creativity. By age 10, Karon says, she knew she wanted to be a writer: \"I stood in front of this very mirror, and I said, I'm going to be an author.\"",
      "How did she know? \"I just knew,\" Karon said. \"I love to read. And so, I wanted to give other people what I received from reading, which was that whole other world.\"",
      "At 14, Karon found herself wanting to escape her world, so she got married, dropped out of school, and gave birth to her daughter, Candace, a year later. She was divorced at 18.",
      "\"A lot of it was really hard, because I became a single mom and had to raise her by myself when I myself had hardly been raised,\" she said.",
      "She worked a series of jobs, including TV producer. She was later fired, and says that was her turning point: \"It brought me to my knees; I'd never been on my knees,\" Karon said. \"I was 42. I just went down: I don't know what to pray for. I'm just here, and I need help and just change me.\"",
      "She became a successful advertising executive, but says she felt called to write more than ads. So, she quit her job, and began weaving her faith into her short stories. She published her work for free in a local newspaper, eventually turning those tales into her first Mitford novel, \"At Home in Mitford,\" in 1994.",
      "I asked, \"I think that when people think about your books and your work, they often think comforting, they think maybe clean, Christian.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful for my Christian readers, very grateful,\" Karon said. \"But I write for a secular audience. God poured his love into me, and you can't say, well, I just can't talk about that in my books.\"",
      "Her latest Mitford work, \"My Beloved,\" is all about presence, aging, and connection. Karon says it was one of the most challenging things she's ever written \u2013 and comes after having said she would never write another Mitford book.",
      "In 2008, she began a short story set during Christmas, but it sat unfinished for more than a decade. In 2021, her daughter, Candace, died of cancer. Karon was moved to write through her grief. The finished work, now a novel, is dedicated to her daughter,",
      "\"She was the sunshine of my life,\" Karon said of Candace.",
      "I asked, \"Do you ever talk to her while you're sitting here writing?\"",
      "\"All the time,\" she replied. \"And I know this sounds corny, but it's true for me, right here, she'll say, 'I hear you, Mom. It's okay, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right.'\"",
      "\"How did losing Candace change your life?\"",
      "\"I'm less judgmental,\" Karon replied. \"I'm a little easier, even on myself. And I've always been really hard on myself. I know that we don't have forever anymore, which is a thing in this book. So, what can we do with this time? Something better than what we're doing? Or even just something more fun? We don't have to be noble all the time.\"",
      "Jan Karon invites us to look for community and neighborly love, to find our own kind of Mitford. \"If you will just get in your car and drive out into America, I'm telling you, I can guarantee, I promise you, that it is out there. You have to look for it. It's not going to come to you and sit on your doorstep. You've got to go out and get it, and it's there for the taking.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",

    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:59:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Frank Gehry was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.",
    "story": [
      "Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, has died, a representative confirmed to CBS News. He was 96.",
      "Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica, California, after a brief respiratory illness, Meaghan Lloyd, his chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP, told CBS News in an email.",
      "He won every major prize that architecture has to offer, including the field's top honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, for what has been described as \"refreshingly original and totally American\" work.",
      "Gehry's fascination with modern pop art led to the creation of some of the most wildly imaginative buildings ever constructed and brought him a measure of worldwide acclaim seldom afforded any architect.",
      "In addition to Spain's Guggenheim Museum and LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, his many masterpieces include Berlin's DZ Bank Building and an expansion of Facebook's Northern California headquarters at the insistence of the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He also designed the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Millennium Park to Maggie Daley Park.",
      "Other honors include the Royal Institute of British Architects gold medal, the Americans for the Arts lifetime achievement award and his native country's highest honor, the Companion of the Order of Canada.",
      "Years after he stopped designing ordinary looking buildings, word surfaced in 2006 that the pedestrian Santa Monica mall project that had led to his career epiphany might be headed for the wrecking ball. Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.",
      "\"They're going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Eventually the mall was remodeled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look. Still, it's no Gehry masterpiece.",
      "Gehry, meanwhile, continued to work well into his 80s, turning out heralded buildings that remade skylines around the world.",
      "The headquarters of the InterActiveCorp, known as the IAC Building, took the shape of a shimmering beehive when it was completed in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in 2007. The 76-story New York by Gehry building, once one of the world's tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.",
      "That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.",
      "Not everyone was a fan of Gehry's work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.",
      "Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as \"oppressive,\" arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.",
      "Still other critics included Dwight D. Eisenhower's family, who objected to Gehry's bold proposal for a memorial to honor the nation's 34th president. Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower's life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.",
      "If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.",
      "He came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson's letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, \"Frank Gehry, you've done it again!\"",
      "\"Some people think I actually do that,\" he would later tell The AP.",
      "Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on Feb. 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him antisemitism might be holding back his career.",
      "Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn't until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognized his talent.",
      "\"It was like the first thing in my life that I'd done well in,\" he said.",
      "He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954. After serving in the Army, he studied urban planning at Harvard University.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Berta; daughter, Brina; sons Alejandro and Samuel; and the buildings he created.",
      "Another daughter, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died of cancer in 2008.",

    "summary": "Steve Cropper co-wrote several classics, including \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,\" \"Green Onions\" and \"In the Midnight Hour.\"",
    "story": [
      "Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",
      "He is survived by his wife and four children.",

      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers, moving to support a sector that's been hurt by tariffs and a U.S. trade war with China.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",
      "Rollins said farmers can apply for the funding in the coming weeks and that it will be disbursed by Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Trade war hit",
      "Roughly $11 billion of the government assistance is set aside for the Department of Agriculture's Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which the White House has said will offer one-time payments to farmers for row crops.",
      "\"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good,\" Bessent\u00a0told \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday.",
      "Farmers have lost billions of dollars in soybean sales this year due to a boycott by China, which\u00a0stopped buying U.S. soybeans\u00a0in May in retaliation for steep new tariffs by the Trump administration. China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing more than half of all American exports of the crop in the last five years, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a preliminary\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0in October, which the White House said involved the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China. The White House said\u00a0in November that China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans in the last two months of 2025.",
      "However, Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans could fall short of what the country normally purchases, CBS News correspondent Lana Zak\u00a0reported in November.",
      "The trade war with China dealt a double whammy to U.S farmers, who were already facing high input costs and weak profit margins. Farmers recently\u00a0told 60 Minutes\u00a0they are suffering major losses on corn, soybeans and cotton. Prices of the crops have fallen in the last two years, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation, an advocacy organization.",
      "Bessent said on Face the Nation on Sunday that domestic soybean prices have risen as much as 15% since the agreement with the Chinese.",
      "The Trump administration started considering\u00a0a financial aid package for farmers\u00a0in October, with sources telling CBS News that it could include more than $10 billion in relief.

    "summary": "Paramount Skydance's $30 per share offer comes just days after Netflix agreed to buy parts of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at nearly $83 billion.",
    "story": [
      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "Potential antitrust hurdle",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Paramount CEO David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009.

      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",

For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1-b-visa-fees-rural-health-care-hospitals/",
    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation is waiving part of a fine assessed against Southwest Airlines after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022.",
      "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty. The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.",
      "Most of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "The department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.",
      "\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"",
      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.",
      "Even before the settlement, the nation's fourth-biggest airline by revenue said the meltdown cost it more than $1.1 billion in refunds and reimbursements, extra costs and lost ticket sales over several months.",

    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

    "summary": "Federal regulators are investigating multiple Texas incidents in which the robotaxis drove around stopped school buses.",
    "story": [
      "Federal regulators said they are expanding an investigation into Waymo this week, following reports that the company's self-driving cars\u00a0navigated around school buses stopped on the road in Austin, Texas.",
      "In a letter to Waymo dated Dec. 3, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will investigate the performance of the autonomous vehicles and their ability to follow traffic safety laws.\u00a0Reuters\u00a0first reported the news.",
      "The Austin Independent School District told CBS News it is now aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. All 50 U.S. states have laws requiring vehicles to halt for a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo said it identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it implemented updates by Nov. 17, which it said improved its vehicles' performance. The company is also planning to issue a voluntary software recall with NHTSA next week, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, chief safety officer at Waymo, told CBS News late Friday.",
      "\"We will continue analyzing our vehicles' performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement,\" said Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Local officials in Austin say they remain concerned about road safety.",
      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",
      "Atlanta Public Schools, a school district, told CBS Atlanta they are aware of six cases where Waymo cars illegally passed stopped school buses.",
      "Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, first started offering its fully autonomous vehicle service to the public in October 2020 in Phoenix. The company now offers hundreds of thousands of driverless rides each week in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and Atlanta.",
      "Waymo recently announced it was expanding to Philadelphia, just one of two dozen cities\u00a0where the company plans to expand.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 17:01:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"It's very discouraging,\" said one young job-seeker as employers pull back on hiring entry-level workers.",
    "story": [
      "Angel Escobedo started looking for work a year and a half ago, even before completing his college degree at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Now, with less than a week to go before graduation and having applied to more than 150 jobs, he's still searching.",
      "Escobedo's predicament illustrates the challenges that many young Americans, even those with impressive academic records, are having entering the nation's workforce amid a broad decline in job listings and as they compete with more experienced people.",
      "\"They're sort of missing out on the ability to jump into the labor market,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It's not a new phenomenon, but it is a concerning phenomenon.\"",
      "For young adults eager to start their careers, the obstacles can seem daunting. Escobedo, 22, has had multiple professional internships during his college career and also completed a management training program at Harvard Business School. The Illinois resident, who is seeking a job in finance or business operations, said he has found the job search process \"very discouraging,\" noting that he's open to just about any kind of employment.",
      "Gen Z job applicants, like other workers, are also having to navigate a quickly changing job-hunting landscape in which employers increasingly use AI and self-recorded video interviews to screen candidates. Job seekers told CBS News that while it's easy to apply for work, finding ways to stand out is hard, while the new tech adds a new layer of complexity.",
      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",

    "story": [
      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The DSA requires platforms to remove \"illegal content,\" among other restrictions, with companies that fail to comply at risk of hefty fines. The law has been a thorn in the side of American tech companies and members of the Trump administration, who claim the sweeping rule violates free speech.",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday at an annual summit and agreed to diversify mutual economic ties, as the United States presses India to revise its decades-old partnership with Russia.",
      "The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi's efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.",
      "After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.",
      "Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.",
      "\"To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,\" Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.",
      "\"Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India's energy sector,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.\"",
      "Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries \"have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.\"",
      "Modi, for his part, said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.",
      "The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.",
      "While India has historically maintained deep ties with Russia, critics say Putin's visit could strain relations with the European Union and the United States and might jeopardize negotiations for major trade agreements with both that are seen as critical for India's exports.",
      "President Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, citing New Delhi's discounted Russian oil. India has been the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China.",
      "India's \"strategic tightrope walk\" between Russia and the West",
      "The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow's war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow's biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases as well.",
      "The sanctions announced in October targeting Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft were the first direct actions against Russia by the U.S. Treasury since Mr. Trump took office for his second term. The Treasury said about a month later that they were having the desired impact, with nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil coming forward to say they would pause purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December.",
      "India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn't come through yet amid strains in relations. The Trump administration has for months tied the imposition of steep tariffs on Indian imports directly to the country's ongoing purchases of Russian energy.",

      "Donthi said India's tilt toward Russia dates back to the Cold War and persists despite its official nonaligned position. \"The significant change now is its desire to be a strategic partner with the U.S. at the same time, which will be a diplomatic challenge,\" he added.",
      "Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The two sides signed a pact in February to improve military cooperation, exercises, port calls, disaster relief assistance and logistics support. Moscow's State Duma ratified the same ahead of Putin's India visit.",
      "India is also expecting to upgrade its Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets and accelerate deliveries of critical military hardware.",
      "India is keen to increase exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture and textiles to Russia and is seeking the removal of non-tariff barriers. New Delhi is also seeking long-term supplies of fertilizers from Moscow.",

    "summary": "Rents in the 50 largest cities have surged by hundreds of dollars per month over the last five years, a LendingTree analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",

      "Atlanta",

      "Boston",
      "Phoenix",
      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",
      "LendingTree's findings are based on an analysis of fair-market rents (FMR) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The federal agency defines such rents as \"estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard-quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\" The firm's figures exclude rents for public housing and for units built within the past two years.",

      "The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million.",

      "Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",
      "DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding.",
      "Market and economic conditions were cited as the cause behind an additional 245,086 layoffs. More than 178,500 workers lost jobs because a company store, unit or department closed. Companies cited restructuring as the reason for another 128,255 layoffs.",
      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "title": "Trump thinks tariff revenue could replace income taxes. Is that possible?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-forecast-2026-price-declines-real-estate-mortgage/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:44:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",
      "To make its projections,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0examined inventory, new construction, price growth, wage and job growth, and unemployment across the 100 cities.",

      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",

      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

      "\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said in a statement.",

      "\"The 31,000 decline in private payrolls reported by ADP was driven by firms with less than 50 employees,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Small firms, those with less than 50 employees, have felt the pinch of policy uncertainty, rising input costs and high interest rates the most.\"",

      "President Trump on Monday announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers, moving to support a sector that's been hurt by tariffs and a U.S. trade war with China.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:03:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Allred will instead seek the Democratic nomination in the Dallas-based 33rd Congressional District.",
    "story": [
      "In a last-minute shake-up, Democrat Colin Allred announced Monday morning he is dropping out of the U.S. Senate race in Texas, hours before Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u00a0filed paperwork to enter the Democratic primary for the race. Instead, Allred said he is going to file paperwork to run for a newly drawn Congressional seat in Dallas County, setting up a primary challenge with Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson.",
      "In a statement Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "\"But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33. The 33rd district was racially gerrymandered by Trump in an effort to further rig our democracy but it's also the community where I grew up attending public schools and watching my mom struggle to pay for our groceries. Veterans in this district have access to the Garland VA hospital that I made a reality when I served in Congress. I have also secured over $135 million in federal resources for affordable housing, public transportation and health care for this district. It's the community where I was raised, and where Aly and I are now raising our two boys. It is my home.\"",
      "Johnson, who replaced Allred in the 32rd Congressional District, will be his main opponent in the primary. Johnson released a statement Monday morning after Allred's announcement, without mentioning him by name.",
      "\"This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out. Families here are dealing with rising costs, housing pressures, and real economic strain. They deserve someone with a strong record in Democratic collaboration and support,\" Johnson said.",
      "Where the Texas Democratic primary for U.S. Senate stands now",
      "Allred's 11th hour move all but confirmed Crockett's decision to run for U.S. Senate, an idea she had warmed to over the past couple of months. Crockett is set to hold a news conference in Dallas at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, 90 minutes before the state's deadline for candidates to file their paperwork for the upcoming March 3rd primary. She told CBS News Texas last month that for her to run for Senate, she would need to see data and polling indicating she could win a general election, not just the primary. With Allred's departure from the Senate race, Crockett will face state Rep. James Talarico of Austin, who has already filed his paperwork. He raised a record $6.2 million in the first three weeks after his announcement and has also generated national headlines.",
      "Allred entered the Senate race in July. While there are other Democratic candidates in the Senate race, the potential for a runoff is a lot lower than when Allred was in the race. The winner of the Democratic primary for Senate will face the winner of the Republican primary, where incumbent Sen. John Cornyn is fighting off a challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton and Houston Rep. Wesley Hunt. Many analysts believe Paxton could win the GOP primary, and as a result, various big-name Democrats have considered running for U.S. Senate because they believe they have an opportunity to win a statewide race for the first time in more than 30 years given the attorney general's political baggage.",
      "Allred's announcement comes amid the recent fight between Democrats and Republicans over the mid-decade redistricting over congressional districts in Texas has upended a lot of races. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 2025 Congressional maps that Republicans redrew over the summer, which are aimed at giving the GOP up to five new House seats in Texas at the expense of Democrats.",
      "Allred, who ran against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year and lost by about nine percentage points, is now fighting to get back into Congress. He represented the 32nd Congressional District in Dallas for three terms but did not file for re-election last year so he could run for Cruz's Senate seat. Johnson succeeded Allred in office.",
      "Now that the 32nd Congressional District will become a Republican majority seat, Johnson decided to run in the 33rd District, which remains a Democratic majority seat and is now only in Dallas County.",
      "Crockett is leaving behind her seat in Congress representing the 30th District in Dallas. As a result of the Supreme Court upholding the 2025 congressional maps, CBS News Texas previously reported that Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth is expected to run in the 30th Congressional District, which is in mostly Dallas County, and a part of eastern Tarrant County. He may be joined by Dr. Frederick Haynes III, senior pastor at Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas. A spokeswoman told CBS News Texas that he was seriously exploring entering the race and confirmed that he was aware of an effort underway to draft him to run.",
      "The newly drawn 32nd Congressional District moves from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority. Republican candidates include Ryan Binkley, Darrell Day, Aimee Carrasco, Monty Montanez and Paul Bondar.",
      "Longtime California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa briefly considered running in this North Texas district but changed his mind after meeting with President Trump. He will run for re-election in his San Diego-area district, which was redrawn by Democrats in California as a result of and to neutralize Texas' redistricting. Texas state Rep.Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, also considered running for this seat, but has announced she is running for re-election in her Texas House district.",

      "After Crockett filed her paperwork, Talarico issued a statement saying, \"We're building a movement in Texas \u2014 fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state. Our movement is rooted in unity over division \u2014 so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\"",
      "Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt are also locked in a closely-watched battle for the GOP nomination. The final general election matchup is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the 2026 national cycle.",
      "Crockett's entry into the race comes after another Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas, dropped out of the race earlier Monday. Instead of filing his paperwork to run in the Senate race, he opted to file to run for the newly-drawn 33rd Congressional District in Dallas County.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the newly-redrawn congressional map could be used in the 2026 election, which included redrawing three Dallas-area districts that are represented by Democrats.",
      "In a statement earlier Monday, Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate. But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33.\"",
      "Before the announcement, some Democrats had expressed disappointment that there could be three major candidates for the U.S. Senate race, instead of spreading out among the other statewide races such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.",
      "In an interview last month, Crockett told CBS News Texas that she would only for U.S. Senate if polling showed she could win a general election, not just the Democratic primary. In the interview, she said she would share her internal polling with Talarico and Allred. \"I'm going to open it up to them because this isn't about me ... It would be really, really, really hard for me now knowing that my district is still at least in its current configuration and knowing that my district absolutely wants me to continue to represent them wholly; it would be really, really hard. But at the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district. It's bigger than the state of Texas. This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "During the interview, the Crockett said she polling for the March 3 primary but instead focusing on the general election next November. Various Democrats have said they believe Paxton will win the Republican primary and because of his political baggage, they think the party has a chance to win a statewide seat for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Crockett said for her to win, she could not count on Republicans crossing over to support her. \"When we ended up with the Trump phenomena or even when we ended up with the Obama phenomenon, they were able to both bring out people that historically did not vote. I think that's the only way that we win in Texas is if we have a candidate that can add to the electorate. If the electorate remains the same electorate that we've had over the last 30 years, then I think we're going to end up with the same result,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Crockett confirmed she spoke with both Talarico and Allred about the Senate race.",
      "Crockett has made national headlines by clashing with President Trump. When asked if she will energize Republicans in addition to Democrats, Matt Angle, Director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told CBS News Texas, \"She could. I think that that's the real challenge is for her to be able to increase turnout for not just her race, but for other Democrats without motivating Republicans. I've been doing politics in Texas a long time. Republicans don't have much to brag about at any level. I'm not sure that being upset with one or two Democrats is going to overcome the fact that they're profoundly disappointed with Republican leadership that's failing them.\"",
      "Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant in North Texas, told CBS News Texas that he agrees with those who believe Crockett cannot win a general election statewide. \"I think she's a real polarizing candidate. She's fun to watch in which she goes crazy on the news. It's always interesting to watch. But I just don't think that's going to work in a general election. I think she is too extreme and too far left for even Texas Democrats,\" Minchillo said. \"I think she'll help turn out Republicans because Republicans are not going to be comfortable with that.\"",
      "Minchillo said he believes the Republican primary is headed for a runoff but doesn't know for sure which two candidates will make advance.",
      "\"We got a long way to go. This has already been a nasty race to begin with. Cornyn came out of the gate saying that he was going to take Paxton to the woodshed and put in words stronger than that. This has been pretty nasty. Cornyn has spent the summer pounding on Paxton. He's moved numbers in his favor. Now, we're seeing a little bit of back and forth. So, this is going to be really rough. The Cornyn folks have actually opened a second front. They're starting to beat on Wesley Hunt. So that's going to be tough. I don't see a path to be honest for Hunt. I just don't think he can beat either Cornyn or Paxton. Maybe a better chance to beat Cornyn, but I just don't think he can get there unless he's got a lot of money,\" Minchillo said",
      "Minchillo predicts that between all of the candidates and their campaigns, plus the third-party groups that support them for both the primary, primary runoff, and general election, tat the Senate race could cost at least $750 million.",
      "With Crockett's decision to run for the Senate, she will leave behind the 30th Congressional District she has represented since 2023. As CBS News Texas reported last week, Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth, will file to run in the newly drawn 30th District, which mostly includes parts of Dallas County and a portion of eastern Tarrant County.

    "summary": "Alina Habba served as a personal lawyer to President Trump before she was tapped to temporarily serve as U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Alina Habba, President Trump's former personal lawyer who was tapped to temporarily serve as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said Monday that she is stepping down from her post after a federal appeals court ruled that she had been unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "\"As a result of the Third Circuit's ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down in my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,\" she wrote in a post on X.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi separately wrote that she had accepted Habba's resignation but faulted the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit for the move, saying the ruling \"has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office.\"",
      "Bondi said Habba will work as a senior adviser to the attorney general for U.S. attorneys and would return to the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey if the Justice Department successfully wins an appeal to the Supreme Court, which it has yet to file.",
      "Habba's decision to step down caps a tumultuous period within the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Her status as the top federal prosecutor was questioned by three criminal defendants who challenged the legality of her appointment as acting U.S. attorney this summer.",
      "A federal district judge ruled in August that Habba had been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld\u00a0that decision disqualifying Habba.",
      "Bondi criticized that ruling, saying the judges who decided the case \"should not be able to countermand the president's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey. The law invoked by the Trump administration allowed her to hold the role for 120 days, though she could continue for longer if the U.S. district court in the state extended her tenure or if the Senate approved her nomination for U.S. attorney.",
      "But ahead of the 120-day deadline, the district court judges in New Jersey declined to keep Habba in the role and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, as U.S. attorney. That decision, however, set off a leadership scramble after Bondi fired Grace.",
      "Mr. Trump and top administration officials then employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey and get around the district court's decision.",
      "The Trump administration has installed temporary U.S. attorneys in Virginia, Nevada and California using similar mechanisms, but continues to face resistance from federal courts. Judges overseeing challenges to all three appointments, including\u00a0Lindsey Halligan\u00a0in Virginia, have ruled that the appointments were unlawful.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure, with a majority of the justices appearing open to overturning a 90-year-old decision that shields some officials from removal without cause.",
      "The case, Trump v. Slaughter, arose from President Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling known as Humphrey's Executor upheld limits established by Congress that enabled the president to remove members of commissions like the FTC only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "The Trump administration argues those limits violate the separation of powers. The FTC wields executive power, so the president should have the authority to fire its members for any reason, it says. Slaughter's attorneys argue the removal protections fall within Congress' power to determine the structure of the government, and say the administration's position would allow the president to upend many other longstanding independent agencies and commissions that have been established by Congress.",
      "During oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, the three liberal justices defended the removal protections and warned that a decision in Mr. Trump's favor could cause chaos across the government. The court's conservatives, meanwhile, expressed skepticism with the argument that Congress could limit the president's ability to remove officials from the FTC and other independent agencies, opening the door to a ruling in the administration's favor.",
      "Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer presented the case for the administration. He urged the justices to overturn the decision in Humphrey's Executor, saying it encroaches on the president's removal authority under Article II of the Constitution.",
      "\"Humphrey's must be overruled. It has become a decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions. It was grievously wrong when it was decided,\" Sauer said. \"It continues to generate confusion in the lower courts, and it continues to tempt Congress to erect, at the heart of our government, a headless fourth branch, insulated from political accountability and democratic control.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, were skeptical of Sauer's argument.",
      "\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,\" Sotomayor said.",
      "She warned that a decision invalidating removal limits for members of the FTC could also put at risk the independence of other federal entities, such as the U.S. Tax Court and broader protections for the civil service. Slaughter's lawyers have warned that a ruling expanding presidential power over multi-member agencies could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, though the Supreme Court has indicated that it views the central bank differently.",
      "Kagan zeroed in on the impacts of a decision overturning Humphrey's Executor, raising the prospect that a ruling striking down the precedent could be used to target protections for officials across the government: \"The question is, where does this lead? Where does it take you to, given what your primary rationale is? Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century \u2026 Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way.\"",
      "She noted that independent agencies also wield legislative and judicial powers and warned that expanding the president's control over them would put \"massive uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president\" and leave the nation with a leader who then has \"control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking in this country.\"",
      "Jackson said that Sauer is \"asking us to infer\" that the removal protections are unconstitutional based on the structure of the Constitution, \"and I don't know why we'd make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.\"",
      "The court's conservatives were more receptive to the Trump administration's arguments.",
      "\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that \"a lot of legislative power has moved into these agencies,\" but said that \"if they're now going to be controlled by the president, it seems to me all the more imperative to do something about it.\"",
      "Attorney Amit Agarwal presented Slaughter's case, and argued that the removal protections have a long tradition in American history. He said that Congress has a role in limiting how officials on independent commissions like the FTC can be removed.",
      "\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" Agarwal said.",
      "Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas tested the boundaries of Agarwal's position, asking him whether Congress could transform Cabinet-level executive departments into multi-member commissions and limit the president's ability to fire their leaders. Agarwal said the Constitution would largely prohibit such a move, since Congress cannot limit the president's authority over officials who are wielding his \"conclusive and preclusive\" powers, which would apply to most departments.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito was similarly skeptical of Agarwal's argument, saying that \"I don't know that you can make the argument that the logic of [Sauer's] argument is going to cause these allegedly revolutionary results without being prepared to explain more concretely than you have the limits of your own argument.\"",
      "Agarwal added later: \"We have a 111-year-old statute that was enacted by the people's elected representatives. It was signed into law by a president of the United States. It was unanimously affirmed by this court. And it's been followed by every single president since 1935 until the present. We don't need an abstract theory to tell us that the FTC Act is OK. It's the other side that needs to give you a really compelling theory to explain why, in our view, 200-plus years of precedent and history need to be abandoned.\"",
      "Gorsuch continued to probe Agarwal's position, hinting that he thought the line Agarwal was trying to draw to limit the president's power to remove officials was unwieldy: \"How are we supposed to decide which powers are exclusive? \u2026 What powers are going to fall in and what are going to fall out? Are we going to have just as much litigation over that as anything else we might do in this case?\"",
      "The background of Trump v. Slaughter",
      "The case is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of that New Deal-era ruling in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have chipped away at that precedent. Most recently, the high court invalidated removal protections for leaders of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "But the Slaughter case now gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to overturn that 90-year-old precedent entirely.",
      "Since he returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the bounds of presidential power and moved to oust a host of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions, including Slaughter.",
      "Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by former President Joe Biden, Slaughter received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "Slaughter, like many other agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, filed a lawsuit arguing that her firing was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Her lawyers argue that Mr. Trump violated that law and Supreme Court precedent with the firing of Slaughter and a second commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya.",
      "A federal district court sided with Slaughter and ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks later, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated to her role at the FTC once again.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in late September to hear the case and allowed Mr. Trump to fire Slaughter while it considers the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the FTC.",
      "The Trump administration argued in filings that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. Removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, Sauer wrote.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power and said Congress could impose removal restrictions for multimember agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, like the FTC.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that since 1935, the FTC has accumulated executive powers. Today, the commission executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote in his filing.",
      "More than 200 Democrats in Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. They wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that over the past 100 years, 15 different presidents from both parties have signed bills into law that created independent agencies.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has already seen some success at the Supreme Court in his bid to assert more control over these bodies. The high court's conservative majority has allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause while legal challenges to their removals moved forward.",
      "The president has also attempted to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will hear arguments in that case next month.",

      "Once one of Mr. Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, Greene has become one of the few Republicans willing to speak out against him in public. As she prepares to resign from Congress before her term ends, Greene told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl the president isn't living up to his \"America First\" motto, and she connected death threats she says she has received with the president's comments about her.",
      "The president said the only reason Greene \"went BAD is that she was JILTED by the president of the United States.\"",
      "\"Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, calling Greene \"washed up\" and a \"low IQ traitor.\"",
      "The president also blasted Stahl, \"60 Minutes\" and the new ownership of Paramount, CBS's parent company, decrying the company's decision to \"allow a show like this to air.\" He added, \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\"",
      "Greene, who voted with Mr. Trump 98% of the time before their relationship began to deteriorate, has said she thinks the president failed to put domestic issues at the top of his agenda, and in her video announcing her resignation, criticized his support of both the crypto and pharmaceutical industries.",
      "Her relationship with Mr. Trump began to sour over records related to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was facing federal sex trafficking charges when he died by suicide in 2019.",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" that after the president called her a traitor, she received a bomb threat on her house \u2014 and then, \"several direct death threats on my son.\"",
      "Asked about her claim that the president was to blame for the threats to her and her son, Greene replied, \"The subject line for the direct death threats on my son was his words: \"Marjorie Traitor Greene.\"",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" the threats were \"directly fueled by President Trump. And I told him. I told JD Vance. I told them all. Sent those directly to them.\"",
      "\"JD Vance replied back to me, 'We'll look into it,'\" Greene added. \"I got [a] response from President Trump that I will keep private, but it wasn't very nice.\"",
      "But when Stahl asked if the president ran her out of Congress, she said no.",
      "\"I will be no one's battered wife,\" she said.",
      "Stahl also asked about the solid support Mr. Trump nonetheless still enjoys among Republicans in Congress.",
      "\"I think they're terrified to step outta line and get a nasty Truth Social post on them,\" Greene said. Stahl asked, \"And they're watching what happened to you?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Greene replied.",
      "Last month, Greene apologized on CNN for what she said had been her role in contributing to America's often venomous political environment with her language. But she also sparred with Stahl over the issue on \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "Stahl asked Greene \"to respond to what you have done in terms of insulting people, yelling at people.\" Greene countered that Stahl was being \"accusatory.\" After Stahl responded, \"I don't insult people,\" Green told her, \"[Y]ou do in the way you question.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is set to take a long-anticipated vote on a Democratic health care proposal this week, a key tenet of the deal to end the government shutdown. But the measure is unlikely to secure the necessary support to advance in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, an issue that was at the center of Democrats' demands in the shutdown fight. The vote was part of an agreement to reopen the longest government shutdown in history, which came to an end when a group of eight Senate Democrats joined Republicans to end the impasse last month. That deal included a promise from GOP leaders to allow a vote on ACA subsidies during the second week of December.",
      "Democrats had the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice. And last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that the party will offer a clean three-year extension of the tax credits. Republicans have opposed an extension without reforms to the subsidies, which help millions of Americans pay for insurance on state-run exchanges. The credits expire at the end of the year.",
      "Some moderate senators sought a compromise position that would stand a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance. Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who was involved in the talks, said last week that \"it was an aspirational discussion, but it never got concrete.\"",
      "\"There was never an engaged discussion about how to extend these tax credits with specifics offered,\" Welch added.",
      "The planned measure is highly unlikely to pick up support from enough Republicans, although it will force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the idea that the bill is a \"nonstarter\" for Republicans.",
      "\"Thirteen votes could solve the problem. That's where the onus should be,\" Schumer said last week. \"They can just vote for this, plain and simple.\"",
      "Republicans have been highly critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise in the new year with the expiration of the tax credits, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension.",
      "Republicans rejected a similar, albeit shorter, extension during the shutdown. At the time, Schumer said Democrats would back a bill to quickly reopen the government if it included a one-year extension of tax credits. But GOP leaders insisted that lawmakers must reopen the government before negotiating on health care. And Senate Republicans made clear at the time that without protections for preventing taxpayer dollars from paying for abortions, the measure didn't stand a chance. The Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, has been among the issues at the center of the health care impasse in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have been circling their own proposal to offer alongside the Democrat-led ACA extension. The move would alleviate pressure on GOP senators, and Republicans have outlined a number of ideas\u00a0aimed at addressing health insurance costs. But they have yet to coalesce behind a single approach, and may ultimately end up forgoing a bill of their own altogether.",
      "Some Senate Republicans have continued to engage in discussions on an extension of the tax credits with new limits on income and reforms to root out waste, fraud and abuse. But others have pushed for alternate proposals to address costs outside of the ACA framework. After President Trump voiced support for giving money directly to Americans over insurance companies, a handful of Republicans have outlined legislation to put funds into health savings accounts for consumers to use to pay for health care costs. Still, a single approach has yet to receive widespread support in the GOP conference.",
      "Without a plan, Senate Republicans' ideas may be pushed aside by their colleagues across the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in recent days that House Republicans will put forward a health care proposal this week, with a plan to vote on a health care bill by the end of the year.",
      "\"We've been saying from the very beginning, we're going to address this before the end of the year,\" Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"There will be big developments early next week, and we're right on track.\"",
      "Johnson said GOP leaders were \"walking members through this\" last week and would continue through the weekend, though he didn't provide details about the planned legislation.",
      "\"The Republican Party is the party with the ideas to fix health care,\" Johnson said.",
      "Patrick  Maguire and \n                                                  \n                      Seiji  Yamashita\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: In this holiday season, with more Americans saying they're feeling the pain of higher prices, we will talk exclusively with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "As Washington winds down 2025, there's still a lot of unfinished business for Congress and President Trump. And, as Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, doubles down on those boat strikes in the Caribbean\u2026",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): We are tracking them, we are killing them, and we will keep killing them so long as they are poisoning our people with narcotics so lethal that they're tantamount to chemical weapons.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the debate over whether they were lawful ramps up on Capitol Hill.",
      "We will talk with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.",
      "Plus, the deportation roundups continue in the nation's cities, this time targeting communities in Minneapolis, including the congresswoman who represents most of the city.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Representative Ilhan Omar.",
      "And, finally, a major change to vaccine guidance for newborns recommended by a panel of advisers chosen by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DR. CODY MEISSNER (Advisory Committee On Immunization Practices): We have heard do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb joins us to break it all down.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot of news to get to.",
      "And we begin with the secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the president described back in April what to expect from this season.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the president's prediction then correct?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the \u2013 you know, we've seen across the \u2013 all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls, instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4 \u2013 4 percent GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3 percent real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka trucks, their CEO said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation. It was 30 bucks the year before that, 25.",
      "Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The PC \u2013 the PCE number, which is about 2.9 percent. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from, for example, the president, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS.",
      "Sixty percent of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are. And his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36 percent in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, at 32 percent.",
      "Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the president's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on and\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, this is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, but \u2013 yes, but I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage.",
      "And I will tell you that affordability has two components. There is inflation and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1 percent. And what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day.",
      "I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The \u2013 we've made a lot of gains, but, remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it was Greg Ip at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" toxic Paul Krugman at \"New York Times,\" or former Vice Chair Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession, the American people don't know how good they have it.",
      "Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or overregulation, that we are now seeing the \u2013 this affordability problem, and I think, next year, we're going to move on to prosperity because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Oh, I \u2013 I think the Biden administration created a terrible\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now. We're nearly 12 months in. You said the president would own the economy at this point.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 yes, I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe, for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time.",
      "And we have pulled that number down, that Strategas Research does something called the Common Man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20 percent. Their index showed 35. This year, for the first time, the Common Man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent, is coming down.",
      "So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 interest rates and inflation.",
      "Immigrant \u2013 mass, unfettered immigration depressed wages, caused housing prices to go up. The president has closed the border. That is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020. And now we are working on inflation. And I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent compared to last September.",
      "The president seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices.",
      "Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, nothing the \u2013 nothing the Biden administration did worked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And the \u2013 because this isn't the same thing. If they \u2013 if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And, like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not \u2013 not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural secretary just said that the president is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short-term relief while you're working on these \u2013 finalizing these trade packages.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, the \u2013 the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular.",
      "I know you spoke with China's vice premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15 percent since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one. You invest in it.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest a soybean farm.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And people in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the \u2013 my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business.",
      "But I probably know more about any treasury secretary than \u2013 about agriculture since the 1800s. And I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty. And we have put that in place with this trade deal, 12.5 million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years for soybeans, also sorghum, the \u2013 and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year? Because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, for the \u2013 for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "But why \u2013 if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department then?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations.",
      "And we are going to create \u2013 create this bridge, because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year, when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump Accounts, and building on this concept.",
      "S, parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids. They're tax-deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028.",
      "So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for, college tuition or their first house. Is that right?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, it is, the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump Accounts. It will be invested in a widely diversified, low-cost index, and then it will be available\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So there was also a broadening of this, this past week, with the Dell Foundation\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 making a significant investment in the American children.",
      "So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market.",
      "As Warren Buffett says, don't \u2013 don't bet against the American stock market. Don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own.",
      "The incredible gift by Michael and Susan Dell will be the \u2013 is a program that philanthropists, foundations can do to top up these accounts. And we are expecting \u2013 we're already \u2013 Treasury is already in discussions with foundations, with major philanthropists to top up these accounts.",
      "It could either be for all children, or you can specify it by zip code, a school district, or you can do what the Dells did, and say that it will be \u2013 won't apply to the zip codes of the top 20 percent of earners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And more information is going to be coming out on how to use this and access it?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, in the coming weeks, we'll do that, and then the official kickoff will be July 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about this massive fraud out in Minnesota, and the state welfare program has been under federal investigation since all the way back in 2022.",
      "The president told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who \u2013 quote \u2013 \"ripped off that state for billions of dollars.\" He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS, for which I'm the acting commissioner, it was discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit.",
      "This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the \u2013 from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government, governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to A.G. Ellison.",
      "But they've been transferred to something called MBSes. The \u2013 and those are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mortgage-backed securities? What do you mean?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transferred to what?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: These are money the bureau services, and they are wire transfer organizations that are outside the regulated banking system, and that money has gone overseas.",
      "And we are tracking that, the \u2013 both to the Middle East and Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but you have no evidence of that money being used to fuel terrorism, which is what some conservative writers are alleging?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's why \u2013 that's why it's an investigation. We started it last week. We'll see where it goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But I can tell you that, you know, it's terrible.",
      "You know, Representative Omar tried to downplay it, said, oh, it was very - - the \u2013 it was very tough to know how this money should \u2013 should be used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: She was gaslighting the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll talk to her.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "But, you know, when you come to this country, you got to learn which side of the road to drive on, you got to learn to stop at stop signs, and you got to learn the \u2013 not to defraud the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are plenty of \u2013 plenty of criminal behavior from communities well beyond the immigrant community.",
      "But we'll talk about this with Representative Omar shortly.",
      "Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.",
      "Welcome to the program.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-Minnesota): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on where the treasury secretary just left off.",
      "He alleged that people who were tied to you or your campaign were involved in this broad, brazen scheme to rip off the Minnesota state welfare system. Do you want to respond to that? Do you know what he is referring to?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the secretary himself understands what he's referring to.",
      "We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And, actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the secretary of ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was \u2013 just for our audience, the Biden era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking.",
      "Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.",
      "We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're \u2013 you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the secretary of ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is something that, you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was, like, political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: So, you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman. And that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her.",
      "We do know that, when the money was stopped, they did sue the A.G. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should continue, that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those \u2013 those alarms.",
      "And we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the treasury secretary say they're investigating.",
      "But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the treasury secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced.",
      "If there was a linkage in that \u2013 the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with \u2013 with these \u2013 with these charges.",
      "And so I do know that, for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all \u2013 that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations.",
      "But, if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And we want those people prosecuted, and we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.",

      "These are Americans that he is calling garbage. And we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, so far, we know, of the people that they have picked up in Minnesota, about five of them are Somalis.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of the few lawmakers shown the classified version of this September 2 video of the U.S. strikes on an alleged drug boat near Venezuela, four strikes in total, we have learned.",
      "You met with Admiral Bradley, who commands Special Operations, as well. The president of the United States says he is open to this video being made public. Do you think it is essential that it become public, and are you confident it will be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which, you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines.",
      "And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself. I know how the public is going to be react \u2013 is going to react, because I felt my own reaction.",
      "You know, I have spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context. And this video was profoundly shaking \u2013 shaken. And I think it's important for Americans to see it, because, look, there's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners.",
      "But I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under, just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it \u2013 why did it shake you so much? What specifically was bothering you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, you know, and this is sort of the distinction, and there's a lot to unpack here about whether this is an authorized military action, which it is not, and right on down to whether these were legitimate \u2013 legitimate targets, and they were not.",
      "But let me go back to some of the reviews I have done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible.",
      "And, in this instance, you may have had bad guys. I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question.",
      "But, in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves.",
      "And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing, because, under the law \u2013 and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this \u2013 under the law, if someone has been struck and is \u2013 continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target.",
      "But if they are outside of combat, they are not, and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys \u2013 and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were \u2013 were barely alive\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD Law of War Manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the secretary of defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight.",
      "I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight, access to radios. There was a link-up point of another potential boat. Drugs were still there. They were actively interacting with them, had to take that reattack.",
      "I said: \"Roger. Sounds good.\"",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.",
      "But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow-up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was, a follow-up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation.",
      "That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then, when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves.",
      "Then, we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40-foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there.",
      "So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations, oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war.",
      "There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully \u2013 or I shouldn't even say boat. They watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike.",
      "So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And, frankly, I have no reason to doubt that.",
      "What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that, if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired, when he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal, et cetera.",
      "It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG lawyers observing all of this.",
      "On NBC this morning, he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Do you know, were these high-level cartel members?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they? If the U.S. had high confidence\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back \u2013 well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this.",
      "I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two. I don't know. But we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are.",
      "Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters, for the reason that you said.",
      "You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American Naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 the \u2013 the kingpins, as they say.",
      "What we're doing here is, we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right, which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins, who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest-level employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying they were not on an internal military target list for high-value individuals. That's what I hear what you're saying.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high-value targets, we designate individuals.",
      "I have no reason to believe, and, in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on a list anywhere. What we are doing \u2013 and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs.",
      "And, to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because - - and, look, they're saying this \u2013 because, if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So, no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be.",
      "You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen.",
      "Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals even without due process?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions.",
      "And you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were OK or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force.",
      "The original sin of this whole thing \u2013 whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then, in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right, often high-value targets, or HVTs, as we've referred to them.",
      "And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high-value target, in a jeep in Northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high- value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK-47, and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives.",
      "You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're going to take the strike, right? Now what we're doing \u2013 and, again, don't \u2013 I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying, that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so, presumably, that information should be shared with you if it does exist.",
      "I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago that Trump \u2013 a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen.",
      "The Pentagon inspector general said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private.",
      "In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right, that this report \u2013 and you read the key line, that this report that said that the secretary of defense put his troops and the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration.",
      "Now, I didn't hear the comment about: I would do this again.",
      "But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again \u2013 and, look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job.",
      "One of the most sensitive and difficult jobs to do in the United States government is being done by somebody who put his own people and the mission at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said he lives life without regret at the Reagan Forum. That was the phrase, to be more exact.",
      "But, Congressman Himes, always good to have you on the program. I will have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy, we're joined now by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and UnitedHealthcare.",
      "Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP, voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30-year-long policy regarding hepatitis B and newborns.",
      "They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is 2 months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes.",
      "Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours.",
      "For a child over the age of 5, if they develop hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95 percent chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity.",
      "For children between the ages of 1 and 5, they only have about a 25 to 50 percent chance of clearing the infection. So, about 25 to 50 percent of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of 1 and 5. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection.",
      "But, when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90 percent of newborns who become infected \u2013 and they'll become infected during delivery \u2013 will go on to develop chronic infection. They won't be able to clear the hepatitis B. And about 25 percent of them will die from sequelae of that infection either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer.",
      "So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's almost 99 percent effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2026",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point. The refrain is \u2013 oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States came out and said, this was very good because hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true.",
      "The fact is, there's a refrain that, if you just test the moms during \u2013 while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and, if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose.",
      "But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to. Many times, those test results aren't checked. And the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when, in fact, you do, of about 2 percent.",
      "That may not sound like a lot, but that 2 percent is going to translate into at least 1,000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated, in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, again, 25 percent of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration.",
      "And, in this board decision, which the public could listen into, it was publicly broadcast, the board was handpicked by RFK Jr., who is a skeptic here of vaccines. From those who voted against the decision to delay, one of them who you heard at the top of the show said, the CDC is doing harm.",
      "Another said: \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\"",
      "Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is \u2013 the ACIP, by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda.",
      "And, look, the secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization or many of these childhood immunizations.",
      "And I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error, insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision-making to. And what we're seeing right now is, as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored.",
      "I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP.",
      "The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, and not ACIP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think, in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision-making body, and it's going to be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There will be certain states that \u2013 that adhere to it, but it will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run at the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines.",
      "You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator Dr. Vinay Prasad are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines.",
      "What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B. This is the vaccines of the future you're saying just won't be created.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "So, Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the Biologics Center, also oversees the vaccine division, he also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the chief medical officer of the agency and chief scientific officer \u2013 so he occupies a lot of positions \u2013 put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with or move away from what they call immunobridging studies.",
      "These are studies that allow you, for well-validated vaccines like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine \u2013 the new vaccine that's formulated against a circulating strain can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza.",
      "For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a longstanding practice. It's \u2013 we do it for flu vaccine. We do it in COVID certainly. We do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes, circulating bacterial serotypes.",
      "This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening.",
      "That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the COVID vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said \u2013 and asked, did it kill more healthy kids than it saved?",
      "The administration to date has not backed up information to back up these claims, but \u2013 but what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner? Because they're arguing they're doing this to help people.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next.",
      "So, the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the COVID vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what their concerns are related to the COVID vaccine itself.",
      "These are \u2013 every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data.",
      "Analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves, are very subjective and require the good will the people involved in that.",
      "And so I think that they should make that analysis public\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in it.",
      "They've already backed away from the 10. There's reporting from Endpoints that now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 07:37:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices convene to hear a case that could lead to the dismantling of protections meant to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

    "summary": "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is leading the Democratic Governors Association for the 2026 midterms, with fellow potential presidential candidate Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer handling a vice chair post.",
    "story": [
      "Gov. Andy Beshear has spent years building a distinct political identity in the reliably red commonwealth of Kentucky by winning statewide as a Democrat even as Republican power has surrounded him.",
      "He's now playing a crucial role that will influence whether there will\u00a0 be others like him around the country.",
      "Heading into what could be a favorable national political environment in the 2026 midterms, Beshear is leading the Democratic Governors Association as it tries to win in states where his party has either lost ground or are hoping to hold on to critical seats.",
      "\"[A] signing in the Rose Garden isn't real to people anymore,\" Beshear said in an exclusive interview with CBS News during a party gathering in Arizona. \"The vote on the resolution, on the amendment, much less a bill, isn't real to people anymore. What Democratic governors do is produce tangible results that you can see and touch and feel.\"",
      "Already that tone is being looked to as a potential way out of the national political malaise that Democrats faced after a string of setbacks during the 2024 presidential election, where they lost the White House, Senate and fell short of winning back the House.",
      "As leaders have contended with the first year of Republican President Donald Trump's second term, there's been a sense of frustration toward Democrats in Washington. This could create a potential opening for governors to chart the future for the party in a way that hasn't been tangible since Bill Clinton and his centrist ideals helped break a presidential losing streak for the left after 12 years of Republicans holding the White House in the late 20th century.",
      "In conversations around governors meetings in Phoenix, Arizona over the last few days, Democrats were at times effusive in sharing their belief that the party's presidential standard bearer in 2028 will be someone who has served like them.",
      "\"I have absolutely no doubt that the candidate in '28 will be from the ranks of the Democratic governors, either current or past,\" Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who led the Democratic governors group in this year's elections, told reporters.",
      "Which of them could potentially break through to the American public however is a fraught topic. Beshear is far from the only leader already facing questions about future ambitions, with other potential candidates including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. All four have been cautious to varying degrees about what their political futures may hold even though they made the party building rounds this weekend in Arizona.",
      "\"As we look to where we are as a country, what we need going forward, the solutions are being driven by the governors,\" Whitmer, who is working alongside Beshear for the midterms as a vice chair for the Democratic governors' political outfit, exclusively told CBS News.",
      "Both Beshear and Whitmer have won two terms each leading their respective states and currently find themselves facing Republican leaders who are skeptical of Democrats by and large or critical of their leadership.",
      "Kentucky GOP chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III said in a statement, that \"while Democratic governors from blue states have made their choice, Kentuckians have made another choice, Republican leadership and Republican policies as opposed to the radical and anti-American policies of the left.\" And in Michigan, Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt, who is running for governor himself, charged that Whitmer's \"more concerned with her public appearance and public relations around the country than she is on solving Michigan's most pressing problems.\"",
      "Attention around the 2026 races have built given the role governors play in this modern political era. Some in the Democratic ranks have centered their leadership on navigating the Trump administration impact on a range of issues within their own states from public safety and the economy to cost of living and quality of life. Mr. Trump's tariffs, housing and grocery prices and the lack of affordable childcare have emerged as leading issues likely to inform how Democrats are running in the midterms.",
      "\"I think we need an executive that can come in and help repair the federal government that this President has torn down,\" Beshear said. \"I think the American people are desperate for results quickly, and that's what Democratic governors deliver.\"",
      "After a year of political infighting and within the family fighting on the national level after Democrats 2024 setbacks, decisive off-year election victories last month in the New Jersey and Virginia races for governor have helped give the left a boost heading into next year.",
      "But those 2026 contests are already tracking to be far more difficult than the open races that played out in those two more reliably blue states this year.",
      "Democrats are attempting to win the Georgia governorship for the first time in decades, while also pushing for\u00a0 Gov. Katie Hobbs to win another term in Arizona. The two races carry national political implications given Mr. Trump won both states in 2024, after they both swung to former Democratic President Joe Biden four years earlier.",
      "National Democrats are also eager to stay in power through open races in the influential battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin. They face a harder dynamic in ousting a Republican incumbent in Nevada and putting a Democrat in the Kansas governor's office for a third straight cycle while also eying potential pickup opportunities in open races in Iowa and Ohio that have become more reliably Republican over the last 15 to 20 years.",
      "\"What I would tell our candidates is get dirt on your boots, make sure that you are showing up in places that maybe Democrats haven't gone in far too long,\" Beshear said during a briefing with reporters.",
      "For several governors \u2014 including Beshear, Whitmer, and Newsom \u2014 their political presence and what their work in 2026 will mean within the party moving forward may prove difficult to disentangle from any potential presidential ambitions. Newsom's brawling political approach to counter Mr. Trump this year has offered the Democratic base a clear alternative to what were considered slow-footed tactics by the party in the Biden-era. Speaking at a press briefing during the Arizona meetings, he steered the conversation to the midterms even as he stressed his views on party building behind the framing of not being there to preach but carrying a responsibility to practice.",
      "\"The playbook is all being rewritten in real time, and we have to be authors of our own success, and we're not victims,\" Newsom said. \"And that's another thing. I just don't like the victim mentality about this. I don't like this party being perceived as weak. More than any other issue, that's the issue that, to me, defines so much of our struggle.\"",
      "Earlier that same day talking to reporters, Beshear and Whitmer were asked about potential 2028 plans. The Michigan governor started off by saying \"I'm not going to share anything other than I think we should have a Democratic governor be our candidate for 2028 president.\" Pressed if either of them would be part of the group that will run, Whitmer gave the kind of answer that's a hallmark of this undefined period in between political seasons, where a party looking for a way back to national power searches for answers without overpromising on who may be at the front of the charge to try and make that happen.",
      "\"Who knows,\" Whitmer said.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 20:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Sean Dunn, who threw a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a CBP officer in downtown D.C. in July was found not guilty of misdemeanor assault in November.",
    "story": [
      "The brief federal criminal trial last month of Sean Dunn, the man who threw a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a Customs and Border Protection officer in downtown Washington, D.C., was only a misdemeanor case. But the courtroom was filled, and the overflow room was crowded, too.",
      "The 12 jurors didn't realize initially that Dunn's case \u2014 and their verdict \u2014 would garner national attention.",
      "One juror thought the deliberations would last under an hour. The juror, a longtime resident of Washington, D.C., also noted that some people in the courtroom struggled to \"keep a straight face\" during the trial and even laughed openly.",
      "\"It seemed to me like an open and closed type of thing,\" another juror said.\u00a0 \"It was kind of ridiculous.\"",
      "Dunn hurled the sandwich at the CBP officer stationed at a busy intersection in August. The incident was widely publicized and quickly became a symbol of resistance against President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital.",
      "After roughly seven hours of deliberation, the jury acquitted Dunn.\tIt was the second time a group of D.C. citizens rejected the Justice Department's claim that Dunn, who was fired from his job at the Justice Department after the incident, had committed a crime in tossing a sandwich at a federal agent. A separate grand jury had rejected the prosecutors' request to indict Dunn on a felony charge earlier this year.",
      "Inside the jury room",
      "Three jurors who sat on the panel spoke with CBS News about the deliberations, revealing how the politically charged case played out behind closed doors in the jury room of the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., near the U.S. Capitol.",
      "All asked to remain anonymous. A court order from the chief judge of the D.C. U.S. District Court prohibits CBS News and other media outlets from publishing the jurors' names.",
      "The jurors described an initial 10-2 split on the 12-person panel. The deliberations were not as simple as some of them had expected.",
      "The majority of jurors thought the incident did not merit criminal charges, or that criminal intent was not proven, according to two of the members of the panel. One juror told CBS News, \"I thought we'd be out of there quickly. This case had no 'grounding.' He threw a sandwich at the agent because he knew it wouldn't hurt. A reasonable person wouldn't think a sandwich is a weapon.\"",
      "A second juror, who told CBS News this was not her first time serving on a D.C. jury, said the panel eventually \"agreed that this is not and should not have been a federal case.\"",
      "The jurors said the two initial holdouts worried that a not guilty verdict would send a message that it's sometimes acceptable to throw things at federal agents.",
      "The two jurors told CBS News that the jury debated at length about the type of \"criminal intent\" that needed to have been demonstrated by prosecutors.",
      "One juror said, \"We asked each other: If we only look at this case, can someone really do harm to someone wearing a ballistic vest by throwing a sandwich?\"",
      "One of the jurors also credited the \"gentle and patient\" foreperson with coming up with a productive communications strategy during deliberations.",
      "A juror who spoke with CBS News by phone was surprised to be assigned to the case, because the juror had heard about the prior rejection by a grand jury of Sean Dunn's felony case.",
      "\"I was surprised some of the other jurors were unfamiliar with it,\" the juror said, noting the headlines generated by Dunn's arrest and the video of the sandwich toss in August.",
      "Though the case was a misdemeanor, without the prospect of a lengthy prison term for conviction, one juror said she noticed an unusual tension in the proceedings at trial.",
      "\"There seemed to be a lot of back and forth between lawyers and the judge to begin with. I've been on a jury before, and that hasn't happened,\" she said. \"So, that kind of stood out to me.\"",
      "The notoriety of Dunn's case and the political tensions surrounding the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents on the streets in D.C., added a unique stress on the jurors. Three told CBS News they're worried about being publicly identified and facing the prospect of threats or harassment.",
      "\"We were very scared and nervous about what this meant for us,\" one juror said.",
      "The same juror, who was familiar with the case before she was selected, said she thought Dunn looked \"really sad and desperate at the defense table because he was going up against the U.S. government.\"",
      "One juror noted one witness and some attorneys in the room appeared to \"giggle\" or fight to keep a \"straight face\" during some of the testimony.",
      "\"I mean,\" the juror said, \"it was a thrown sandwich.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 17:16:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation is waiving part of a fine assessed against Southwest Airlines after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022.",
      "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty. The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.",
      "Most of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "The department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.",
      "\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"",
      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday that any link between allegations of fraud by members of the Somali community and terrorism would be a \"failure of the FBI\" amid calls to investigate a series of multimillion-dollar alleged pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "The Treasury Department said last week that it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. And House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation last week into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that she's \"pretty confident\" that the alleged link to terrorism is a false claim, citing prosecutions and sentences that have already taken place.",
      "\"If there was a linkage in the money that they have stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out,\" Omar said.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat said the accusations have been around for many years. But she added, \"if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know.\"",
      "\"And we want those people prosecuted,\" Omar said. \"And we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.\"",
      "Minnesota is home to the largest Somali-American population in the U.S. The vast majority of the foreign-born Somali population have U.S. citizenship, according to 2024 Census Bureau figures. The bulk of those charged in the fraud scheme were of Somali descent, though the founder of the group, called Feeding Our Future, is White and was convicted at trial earlier this year.",
      "The president has blamed the fraud on the Somali people, while saying in recent days that Somali immigrants do \"nothing but complain.\" He called Omar, and \"friends\" of the Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager, \"garbage.\"",
      "Omar called the president's comments \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"These are Americans that he is calling garbage, and we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me,\" Omar said. \"I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the President.\"",
      "Omar said the fraud scheme also has an impact on Somalis, \"because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.\"",
      "\"We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen,\" she said. \"And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said \"this is part of the continued cleanup.\"",
      "\"A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,\" Bessent said, alleging that individuals charged had donated to Gov. Tim Walz, Omar and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison. He said that money \"has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.\"",
      "Omar said she doesn't know what Bessent is referring to.",
      "\"We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved,\" she said. \"We sent that money back a couple of years ago, and actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of [Agriculture] asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump took aim at Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democratic congressman from Texas whom he recently pardoned, in a Truth Social post.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump slammed Rep. Henry Cuellar on Sunday for what he called \"a lack of loyalty\" because the Democratic congressman announced his plans to run again as a Democrat, rather than switch to the Republican party, in his next bid to represent Texas in the U.S. House.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump suggested that he may have expected Cuellar to help Republicans maintain their slim majority in the House during the 2026 midterm elections after the congressman was granted clemency.",
      "Cuellar is a Democrat and has represented Texas' 28th district as a member of that party since 2005. Mr. Trump recently pardoned him and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who were both indicted last year on federal bribery charges. Their two daughters, Christina and Catherine, had sent Mr. Trump a letter in November asking that he pardon their parents.",
      "The president claimed the allegations against them resulted from political targeting by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden, writing in multiple Truth Social posts about attacks on Cuellar from within the Democratic Party over his views on immigration and border security.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump issued the pardons, Cuellar announced his decision to launch another congressional campaign, still as a Democratic candidate. In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0on Sunday about Cuellar, Mr. Trump slammed the congressman for not switching parties in the wake of the president's favor.",
      "\"Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be 'running' for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas (a state where I received the highest number of votes ever recorded!), as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And provably still do!\" wrote Mr. Trump, characterizing Cuellar's move as \"such a lack of LOYALTY.\"",
      "\"Next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!\" the president added.",
      "Cuellar discussed the pardon on Sunday during an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" saying he believed the indictment against him and his wife was an act of retaliation by Biden administration officials over his criticism of the former president's border policies.",
      "\"I now look at all the evidence, and looking at everything, definitely I feel that I was weaponized, that he [former President Biden] used the department to go after myself and my family,\" said Cuellar. \"And I'll tell you something, if they want to come after me because I was a critic about open borders, that's one thing. But you don't bring the family in. You just don't do that.\"",
      "CBS News contacted Cuellar's office for comment on Mr. Trump's Truth Social post but did not receive an immediate response.",
      "A party switch would have been an unexpected bonus for Republicans after the GOP-run Legislature redrew the state's congressional districts this year at Mr. Trump's behest. Cuellar's South Texas district, which includes parts of metro San Antonio, was not one of the Democratic districts that Republicans changed substantially.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who now serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy. We're joined now by former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30 year long policy regarding Hepatitis B and newborns. They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is two months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours. For a child over the age of five, if they develop Hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95% chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity. For children between the ages of one and five, they only have about a 25 to 50% chance of clearing the infection, so about 25 to 50% of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of one and five. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection. But when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90% of newborns who become infected, and they'll become infected during delivery, will go on to develop chronic infection, they won't be able to clear the hepatitis B, and about 25% of them will die from sequelae of that infection, either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer. So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract Hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection, it's almost 99% effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2013",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point, the refrain is, oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States came out and said, this was very good, because Hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true. The fact is, there's a refrain that if you just test the moms during, while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose. But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to, many times, those test results aren't checked, and the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when in fact, you do, of about 2 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but that 2% is going to translate into at least 1000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B, and again, 25% of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration and in this board decision, which the public could listen into. It was publicly broadcast. The board was hand picked by RFK Jr, who is a skeptic here of vaccines, from those who voted against the decision to delay. One of them who you heard at the top of the show said the CDC is doing harm. Another said, \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\" Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is the ACIP by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda. And look, the Secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization, or many of these childhood immunizations, and I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision making to, and what we're seeing right now is as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored. I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP. The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and not ACIP. So I think in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision making body, and it's going to be more symbolic. There will be certain states that- that adhere to it, but will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines. You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines. What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B, this is the vaccines of the future. You're saying just won't be created?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the biologic center. Also oversees the vaccine Division. He also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the Chief Medical Officer of the agency, and chief scientific officer. So he occupies a lot of positions. Put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with, or move away from, what they call immuno bridging studies. These are studies that allow you for well validated vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine, the new vaccine, that's formulated against the circulating strain, can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza. For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a long standing practice. It's, we do it for flu vaccine, we do it in covid Certainly, we do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes circulating bacterial serotypes. This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change, and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the Fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said, they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening. That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the Covid vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said and asked, Did it kill more healthy kids than it saved? The administration, to date, has not backed up information to back up these claims, but, but, what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner, because they're arguing they're doing this to help people?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next. So the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the covid vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what the concerns are related to the covid vaccine itself. These are- every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves are very subjective and require the goodwill the people involved in that. And so I think that they should make that analysis public so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in that they've already backed away from the 10 is reporting from endpoints that now they're saying it's eight or nine, so they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out. Dr Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"zero credibility\" on the September strikes on an alleged drug boat, citing \"shifting explanations\" from the Pentagon for the second strike, which has drawn scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "Himes was among a small number of lawmakers who last week received briefings from military officials behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, which centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the Sept. 2 follow-on strike that has become a flashpoint in Congress. The lawmakers were shown video of the second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, after the Washington Post reported a week earlier that a second attack killed two survivors of the initial strike.",
      "Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Himes urged that it's \"really important that this video be made public,\" noting that the interpretation of the video from lawmakers who were briefed \"broke down precisely on party lines.\"",
      "\"And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself,\" Himes said. \"I know how the public is going to react because I felt my own reaction.\"",
      "Himes said he's spent hours looking at videos of lethal action taken by the U.S., while noting that he was \"profoundly shaken\" by the video of the Sept. 2 strikes.",
      "\"There's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under, just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing,\" Himes said.",
      "The strike was the first in the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere. Since then, the U.S. has conducted more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. Even before the Post's report, the attacks had attracted scrutiny from lawmakers since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. But the administration has argued that since it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations, it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes, although the administration has not offered proof the vessels are being operated by drug cartels.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who was also briefed last week, refuted Himes' characterization of the video last week. And on Sunday, he told \"Meet the Press\" that the survivors \"were not incapacitated in any way,\" adding that it was \"entirely appropriate to strike the boat again to make sure that its cargo was destroyed.\"",
      "Cotton said it appeared the individuals were \"sitting or standing on top of a capsized boat, they weren't floating helplessly in the water.\"",
      "\"I don't think it matters all that much what they were trying to do,\" Cotton said, adding that it looked at one point like they were trying to flip the boat back over.",
      "Himes responded to the comments on \"Face the Nation\" saying, \"as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing.\"",
      "\"If someone has been struck and continues to engage in hostilities \u2014 points a gun at you, has a gun \u2014 they may be a legitimate target, but if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war,\" Himes said. \"And these guys \u2014 and this is why the American people need to see this video \u2014 these guys were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.\"",
      "The lawmakers were briefed by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, who was leading the mission and whom Hegseth has said made the decision to strike the boat again.",
      "Himes said people who have worked with Bradley describe him as having had a \"storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity.\" But he said what the incident raises \"is what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired.\"",
      "\"It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that if he weren't in that context, he might not do,\" Himes added.",
      "Hegseth described his own role in the Sept. 2 strikes at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, saying he was told there had to be a \"reattack\" because there were \"a couple folks who could still be in the fight,\" citing possible access to radio, drugs still present and a \"linkup point of another potential boat.\"",
      "\"I said, 'roger, sounds good,'\" Hegseth said. \"From what I understood then and what I understand now, I fully support that strike. I would have made the same call myself.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether the secretary's statement matched what he was told in the briefing, Himes said \"there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.\"\"But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter,\" Himes added.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's elevation of Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg to lead a high-profile office within the Food and Drug Administration is raising alarm among multiple senior FDA officials.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's elevation of a vaccine skeptic to lead a high-profile office within the Food and Drug Administration is raising alarm among multiple senior FDA officials, who told CBS News the appointment will harm the agency's reputation as a reliable steward of the nation's drug supply.",
      "On Wednesday, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg was tapped as acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which is responsible for evaluating new drugs and ensuring adequate supplies of existing ones. Her appointment came after the abrupt resignation of Richard Pazdur, a veteran FDA scientist who took over the office just three weeks ago.",
      "\"Putting Tracy Beth in charge is like dropping an atom bomb,\" one agency source said, adding that multiple top-level officials are preparing resignations. \"It's an extinction level event. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg has never supervised a drug review, never has conducted a clinical trial. She doesn't understand laws and regulations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about H\u00f8eg's qualifications. H\u00f8eg did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement when she was appointed, H\u00f8eg said, \"I am committed to transparency, honesty, and decisions based on rigorous science and ensuring important changes happen efficiently.\"",
      "H\u00f8eg has been a controversial figure. This fall, she advocated making it more difficult for young men to receive the COVID vaccine because of the potential risks from a rare side effect, myocarditis,\u00a0according to STAT News. Since joining the FDA in March, she has been advising Commissioner Marty Makary on the agency's vaccine policy, and helped write a recent memo claiming FDA leaders found at least 10 children had died \"after and because of\" receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The memo, which was obtained by CBS News, offered no data to back that claim. HHS said it plans to release data on it soon.",
      "That memo also outlined planned agency changes in handling COVID-19 and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign. After it was made public, a dozen former FDA leaders denounced the proposed changes, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine that they \"undermine a regulatory model designed to ensure vaccine safety, effectiveness, and availability\" and \"represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job.\"",
      "In her new role, H\u00f8eg will oversee an office charged with ensuring all over-the-counter and prescription drugs in America are safe and effective. The office is also tasked with approving new drugs that pharmaceutical companies are seeking to bring to market and providing guidance to health care professionals and consumers.",
      "One senior FDA official said there is widespread fear that H\u00f8eg will politicize a science-focused office responsible for America's drug development and pipeline. As a result, the source said, companies might no longer view the FDA as a reliable partner and may choose to develop new products overseas, where the regulatory environment is \"more stable.\"",
      "H\u00f8eg, who is a sports medicine physician and epidemiologist, served as the FDA's representative on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that on Friday revised decadeslong guidance on when children should get their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.",
      "During Friday's meeting, H\u00f8eg questioned the childhood vaccination schedule, saying the U.S. is an \"international outlier\" in the number of vaccines it recommends for children.",
      "\"Why are we so different from other developed nations, and is it scientifically and medically justified?\" she asked, later adding, \"just because the U.S. has a larger high-risk population of children, should the core childhood vaccination schedule be larger like this?\"",
      "\"Scientifically, it doesn't make sense to make different recommendations for low-risk populations from one country to another,\" she said.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics says the longstanding U.S. recommendations are based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Still, H\u00f8eg acknowledged the effectiveness of some vaccines, citing the recent measles outbreak.",
      "\"The increase is predominantly among the unvaccinated,\" she said. \"This is reality. It's important to state, we know the measles vaccine does prevent measles, and that we are seeing measles cases among unvaccinated children.\"",
      "In a statement announcing H\u00f8eg's appointment, Makary said she was \"the right scientist to fully modernize\" the drug regulator's office. He added \"she advanced scientific rigor through her commitment to providing the public with the highest quality of evidence.\"",
      "During Friday's advisory meeting, H\u00f8eg noted declining trust in the U.S. health care system during the pandemic and linked the erosion to vaccine mandates, continued masking and political polarization.",
      "\"I do think that that has contributed to a loss of trust when people are coerced to take vaccines,\" she said.",
      "H\u00f8eg is the fifth person this year to head a drug office that has been rocked by sudden leadership changes. In November, George Tidmarsh resigned after federal officials began reviewing \"serious concerns about his personal conduct,\" according to a government spokesperson. Tidmarsh has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Pazdur, who was appointed director of the office less than a month ago, was a 26-year veteran of the agency who specialized in cancer drug approvals. He resigned after clashing with Makary, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The sources said Pazdur agreed to do the job on the condition that Makary didn't intervene with the office's work. But within weeks, the FDA chief began interviewing candidates to fill roles Pazdur oversaw. One of the sources said Pazdur demanded Makary resign, and when he didn't, the cancer scientist stepped down.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said Sunday as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",

      "Ahead of Sunday's announcement of the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame's Contemporary Era Class, President Trump on Saturday called on the committee to admit pitcher Roger Clemens, who is one of eight players on the ballot.",
      "In a lengthy Truth Social post, the president argued that the committee \"should do the right thing by finally putting Roger Clemens, known as 'The Rocket,' in the Hall!,\" adding that Clemens is \"clearly one of the Greatest Pitchers of All Time.\"",
      "The president noted Clemens' 354 career wins, ninth all-time in Major League Baseball history, and his seven Cy Young awards, an annual achievement given out to the best pitchers in the American and National leagues. He also had 4,672 strikeouts, third all-time behind Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Randy Johnson (4,875).",
      "The 63-year-old Clemens has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, which he has denied. In June of 2012, following a 10-week trial,\u00a0a federal jury found Clemens not guilty\u00a0of charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress in denying he had used PEDs.",
      "\"The only reason he is not is because of rumors and innuendo, which were not proven,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"He never tested positive and, when the Obama DOJ went after him in a criminal case claiming that he did take steroids, Roger, who has always denied taking any drugs, was FULLY ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES.\"",
      "Clemens was charged over a deposition and congressional testimony he gave in February 2008 in a nationally televised hearing. The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during a 24-year career.",
      "In that 2008 hearing, Clemens told Congress that \"no matter what we discuss here today, I'm never going to have my name restored.\"",
      "He was denied election to the Hall for 10 straight years by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with his final ballot appearance coming in 2022, his last year of eligibility under the traditional rules.",
      "However, they are now in the Contemporary Baseball Era player ballot, which according to the Hall \"features candidates whose primary contribution to the game came since 1980.\"",
      "The Hall in 2022 restructured its veterans committees for the third time in 12 years, setting up panels to consider the contemporary era from 1980 on as well as the classic era. The contemporary baseball era holds separate ballots for players and another for managers, executives and umpires.",
      "Each committee meets every three years. Contemporary managers, executives and umpires will be considered in December 2026, classic era candidates in December 2027 and contemporary era players again in December 2028.",
      "The contemporary committee features 16 members, including Hall of Fame players Ferguson Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony P\u00e9rez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell and Robin Yount. They will be joined by former major league general managers Kim Ng, Doug Melvin, Tony Reagins and Terry Ryan, and media members Tyler Kepner and Jayson Stark of The Athletic and historian Steve Hirdt, the Hall said Tuesday.",

      "Each voter can select up to three candidates, and 75% or more of ballots are needed for election. Anyone chosen will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 26 along with players voted in by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, whose balloting will be announced on Jan. 20.",
      "Under a change announced by the Hall last March, any candidate on the ballot who receives fewer than five votes will not be eligible for that committee's ballot during the next three-year cycle.

    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",

    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "story": [
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued after a powerful solar flare over the weekend.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 9:49 p.m. EST on Sunday, November 30, said NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which constantly monitors the sun. The flare was classified as X1.9 flare, the space agency said. X-classes are the most intense kind of flare. The eruption came from a newly emerging sunspot region.",
      "The flare briefly knocked out radio communications across Australia and parts of southeast Asia on Tuesday, Space.com reported.",
      "A coronal mass ejection, or CME, also occurred. During CMEs, solar material and magnetic fields erupt from the sun. CMEs and solar flares are similar, but they are distinct phenomena, NASA said.",
      "Flares and CMEs can impact radio communications, power grids and navigation signals, NASA said. They can also pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts. When CMEs reach Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.",
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued for Thursday, December 4. The CME is not expected to reach Earth, but can still have minor impacts including \"manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,\" NOAA said. There is some unpredictability in the forecast, NOAA noted, so the storm could arrive as early as December 3.",
      "The Northern Lights may be visible in northern and upper states between New York and Idaho. Weather forecasts, including a powerful winter storm, may limit the chances of seeing the phenomenon.",
      "Scientists may see more space weather activity between December 1 and December 5, NOAA said, as the sun's newly emerging sunspot region rotates to face the Earth. The sunspot, labeled AR4299, is where the recent flare and CME originated from.",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers, moving to support a sector that's been hurt by tariffs and a U.S. trade war with China.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",
      "Rollins said farmers can apply for the funding in the coming weeks and that it will be disbursed by Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Trade war hit",
      "Roughly $11 billion of the government assistance is set aside for the Department of Agriculture's Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which the White House has said will offer one-time payments to farmers for row crops.",
      "\"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good,\" Bessent\u00a0told \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday.",
      "Farmers have lost billions of dollars in soybean sales this year due to a boycott by China, which\u00a0stopped buying U.S. soybeans\u00a0in May in retaliation for steep new tariffs by the Trump administration. China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing more than half of all American exports of the crop in the last five years, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a preliminary\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0in October, which the White House said involved the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China. The White House said\u00a0in November that China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans in the last two months of 2025.",
      "However, Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans could fall short of what the country normally purchases, CBS News correspondent Lana Zak\u00a0reported in November.",
      "The trade war with China dealt a double whammy to U.S farmers, who were already facing high input costs and weak profit margins. Farmers recently\u00a0told 60 Minutes\u00a0they are suffering major losses on corn, soybeans and cotton. Prices of the crops have fallen in the last two years, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation, an advocacy organization.",
      "Bessent said on Face the Nation on Sunday that domestic soybean prices have risen as much as 15% since the agreement with the Chinese.",
      "The Trump administration started considering\u00a0a financial aid package for farmers\u00a0in October, with sources telling CBS News that it could include more than $10 billion in relief.

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:03:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Allred will instead seek the Democratic nomination in the Dallas-based 33rd Congressional District.",
    "story": [
      "In a last-minute shake-up, Democrat Colin Allred announced Monday morning he is dropping out of the U.S. Senate race in Texas, hours before Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u00a0filed paperwork to enter the Democratic primary for the race. Instead, Allred said he is going to file paperwork to run for a newly drawn Congressional seat in Dallas County, setting up a primary challenge with Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson.",
      "In a statement Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "\"But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33. The 33rd district was racially gerrymandered by Trump in an effort to further rig our democracy but it's also the community where I grew up attending public schools and watching my mom struggle to pay for our groceries. Veterans in this district have access to the Garland VA hospital that I made a reality when I served in Congress. I have also secured over $135 million in federal resources for affordable housing, public transportation and health care for this district. It's the community where I was raised, and where Aly and I are now raising our two boys. It is my home.\"",
      "Johnson, who replaced Allred in the 32rd Congressional District, will be his main opponent in the primary. Johnson released a statement Monday morning after Allred's announcement, without mentioning him by name.",
      "\"This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out. Families here are dealing with rising costs, housing pressures, and real economic strain. They deserve someone with a strong record in Democratic collaboration and support,\" Johnson said.",
      "Where the Texas Democratic primary for U.S. Senate stands now",
      "Allred's 11th hour move all but confirmed Crockett's decision to run for U.S. Senate, an idea she had warmed to over the past couple of months. Crockett is set to hold a news conference in Dallas at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, 90 minutes before the state's deadline for candidates to file their paperwork for the upcoming March 3rd primary. She told CBS News Texas last month that for her to run for Senate, she would need to see data and polling indicating she could win a general election, not just the primary. With Allred's departure from the Senate race, Crockett will face state Rep. James Talarico of Austin, who has already filed his paperwork. He raised a record $6.2 million in the first three weeks after his announcement and has also generated national headlines.",
      "Allred entered the Senate race in July. While there are other Democratic candidates in the Senate race, the potential for a runoff is a lot lower than when Allred was in the race. The winner of the Democratic primary for Senate will face the winner of the Republican primary, where incumbent Sen. John Cornyn is fighting off a challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton and Houston Rep. Wesley Hunt. Many analysts believe Paxton could win the GOP primary, and as a result, various big-name Democrats have considered running for U.S. Senate because they believe they have an opportunity to win a statewide race for the first time in more than 30 years given the attorney general's political baggage.",
      "Allred's announcement comes amid the recent fight between Democrats and Republicans over the mid-decade redistricting over congressional districts in Texas has upended a lot of races. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 2025 Congressional maps that Republicans redrew over the summer, which are aimed at giving the GOP up to five new House seats in Texas at the expense of Democrats.",
      "Allred, who ran against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year and lost by about nine percentage points, is now fighting to get back into Congress. He represented the 32nd Congressional District in Dallas for three terms but did not file for re-election last year so he could run for Cruz's Senate seat. Johnson succeeded Allred in office.",
      "Now that the 32nd Congressional District will become a Republican majority seat, Johnson decided to run in the 33rd District, which remains a Democratic majority seat and is now only in Dallas County.",
      "Crockett is leaving behind her seat in Congress representing the 30th District in Dallas. As a result of the Supreme Court upholding the 2025 congressional maps, CBS News Texas previously reported that Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth is expected to run in the 30th Congressional District, which is in mostly Dallas County, and a part of eastern Tarrant County. He may be joined by Dr. Frederick Haynes III, senior pastor at Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas. A spokeswoman told CBS News Texas that he was seriously exploring entering the race and confirmed that he was aware of an effort underway to draft him to run.",
      "The newly drawn 32nd Congressional District moves from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority. Republican candidates include Ryan Binkley, Darrell Day, Aimee Carrasco, Monty Montanez and Paul Bondar.",
      "Longtime California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa briefly considered running in this North Texas district but changed his mind after meeting with President Trump. He will run for re-election in his San Diego-area district, which was redrawn by Democrats in California as a result of and to neutralize Texas' redistricting. Texas state Rep.Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, also considered running for this seat, but has announced she is running for re-election in her Texas House district.",

      "Rozier appeared before Magistrate Judge Clay H. Kaminsky on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was released on a $3 million bond secured by a home in Florida, for which the court sealed the address.",
      "Rozier was arrested in Orlando on Oct. 23 during a sweeping FBI crackdown in which 34 defendants were snagged across two federal indictments. Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme which facilitated bets on NBA basketball games that allegedly took advantage of insider information related to injury reports.",
      "Rozier and five other defendants are accused of providing nonpublic information in exchange for a flat fee or a cut of the profits. In one game in particular, prosecutors allege, Rozier told a co-conspirator that he would fake an injury in order to leave a game early.",
      "Federal investigators had been examining unusual betting activity over a Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans game on March 23, 2023. Rozier, who played for the Hornets before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024, played only 9 minutes and 34 seconds, leaving the game with right foot discomfort. At the time, the NBA said it found no evidence that Rozier violated league rules.",
      "Rozier is not charged in the other indictment, which focuses on an\u00a0elaborate cheating scheme\u00a0that allegedly netted more than $7 million from rigged poker games, prosecutors said.",
      "Rozier appeared in court Monday alongside co-defendant Deniro Laster. Prosecutors allege that Laster, a childhood friend of Rozier's, orchestrated the sharing of non-public information and bets between various gambling rings. Laster, who lives in Cleveland, was released on a $50,000 secured bond by his mother and cousin.",

Our movement is rooted in unity over division \u2014 so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\"",
      "Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt are also locked in a closely-watched battle for the GOP nomination. The final general election matchup is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the 2026 national cycle.",
      "Crockett's entry into the race comes after another Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas, dropped out of the race earlier Monday. Instead of filing his paperwork to run in the Senate race, he opted to file to run for the newly-drawn 33rd Congressional District in Dallas County.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the newly-redrawn congressional map could be used in the 2026 election, which included redrawing three Dallas-area districts that are represented by Democrats.",
      "In a statement earlier Monday, Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate. But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33.\"",
      "Before the announcement, some Democrats had expressed disappointment that there could be three major candidates for the U.S. Senate race, instead of spreading out among the other statewide races such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.",
      "In an interview last month, Crockett told CBS News Texas that she would only for U.S. Senate if polling showed she could win a general election, not just the Democratic primary. In the interview, she said she would share her internal polling with Talarico and Allred. \"I'm going to open it up to them because this isn't about me ... It would be really, really, really hard for me now knowing that my district is still at least in its current configuration and knowing that my district absolutely wants me to continue to represent them wholly; it would be really, really hard. But at the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district. It's bigger than the state of Texas. This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "During the interview, the Crockett said she polling for the March 3 primary but instead focusing on the general election next November. Various Democrats have said they believe Paxton will win the Republican primary and because of his political baggage, they think the party has a chance to win a statewide seat for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Crockett said for her to win, she could not count on Republicans crossing over to support her. \"When we ended up with the Trump phenomena or even when we ended up with the Obama phenomenon, they were able to both bring out people that historically did not vote. I think that's the only way that we win in Texas is if we have a candidate that can add to the electorate. If the electorate remains the same electorate that we've had over the last 30 years, then I think we're going to end up with the same result,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Crockett confirmed she spoke with both Talarico and Allred about the Senate race.",
      "Crockett has made national headlines by clashing with President Trump. When asked if she will energize Republicans in addition to Democrats, Matt Angle, Director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told CBS News Texas, \"She could. I think that that's the real challenge is for her to be able to increase turnout for not just her race, but for other Democrats without motivating Republicans. I've been doing politics in Texas a long time. Republicans don't have much to brag about at any level. I'm not sure that being upset with one or two Democrats is going to overcome the fact that they're profoundly disappointed with Republican leadership that's failing them.\"",
      "Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant in North Texas, told CBS News Texas that he agrees with those who believe Crockett cannot win a general election statewide. \"I think she's a real polarizing candidate. She's fun to watch in which she goes crazy on the news. It's always interesting to watch. But I just don't think that's going to work in a general election. I think she is too extreme and too far left for even Texas Democrats,\" Minchillo said. \"I think she'll help turn out Republicans because Republicans are not going to be comfortable with that.\"",
      "Minchillo said he believes the Republican primary is headed for a runoff but doesn't know for sure which two candidates will make advance.",
      "\"We got a long way to go. This has already been a nasty race to begin with. Cornyn came out of the gate saying that he was going to take Paxton to the woodshed and put in words stronger than that. This has been pretty nasty. Cornyn has spent the summer pounding on Paxton. He's moved numbers in his favor. Now, we're seeing a little bit of back and forth. So, this is going to be really rough. The Cornyn folks have actually opened a second front. They're starting to beat on Wesley Hunt. So that's going to be tough. I don't see a path to be honest for Hunt. I just don't think he can beat either Cornyn or Paxton. Maybe a better chance to beat Cornyn, but I just don't think he can get there unless he's got a lot of money,\" Minchillo said",
      "Minchillo predicts that between all of the candidates and their campaigns, plus the third-party groups that support them for both the primary, primary runoff, and general election, tat the Senate race could cost at least $750 million.",
      "With Crockett's decision to run for the Senate, she will leave behind the 30th Congressional District she has represented since 2023. As CBS News Texas reported last week, Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth, will file to run in the newly drawn 30th District, which mostly includes parts of Dallas County and a portion of eastern Tarrant County. Veasey has represented the current 33rd Congressional District, which stretches from his hometown of Fort Worth to Dallas, since 2013.",
      "Frederick Haynes, III, senior pastor at the Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas, has also explored running for the 30th Congressional District and confirmed he was aware of an effort to draft him to run.",

    "summary": "Alina Habba served as a personal lawyer to President Trump before she was tapped to temporarily serve as U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Alina Habba, President Trump's former personal lawyer who was tapped to temporarily serve as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said Monday that she is stepping down from her post after a federal appeals court ruled that she had been unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "\"As a result of the Third Circuit's ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down in my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,\" she wrote in a post on X.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi separately wrote that she had accepted Habba's resignation but faulted the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit for the move, saying the ruling \"has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office.\"",
      "Bondi said Habba will work as a senior adviser to the attorney general for U.S. attorneys and would return to the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey if the Justice Department successfully wins an appeal to the Supreme Court, which it has yet to file.",
      "Habba's decision to step down caps a tumultuous period within the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Her status as the top federal prosecutor was questioned by three criminal defendants who challenged the legality of her appointment as acting U.S. attorney this summer.",
      "A federal district judge ruled in August that Habba had been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld\u00a0that decision disqualifying Habba.",
      "Bondi criticized that ruling, saying the judges who decided the case \"should not be able to countermand the president's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey. The law invoked by the Trump administration allowed her to hold the role for 120 days, though she could continue for longer if the U.S. district court in the state extended her tenure or if the Senate approved her nomination for U.S. attorney.",
      "But ahead of the 120-day deadline, the district court judges in New Jersey declined to keep Habba in the role and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, as U.S. attorney. That decision, however, set off a leadership scramble after Bondi fired Grace.",
      "Mr. Trump and top administration officials then employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey and get around the district court's decision.",
      "The Trump administration has installed temporary U.S. attorneys in Virginia, Nevada and California using similar mechanisms, but continues to face resistance from federal courts. Judges overseeing challenges to all three appointments, including\u00a0Lindsey Halligan\u00a0in Virginia, have ruled that the appointments were unlawful.",
      "Halligan had secured indictments against two of Mr. Trump's political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, while serving as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia. But a judge ordered the cases to be dismissed last month after concluding Halligan was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

    "story": [
      "A Cinnabon worker was fired from a Wisconsin store where she worked after a video that showed her shouting racist slurs, including the N-word, at two customers went viral online. The Georgia-based cinnamon roll chain confirmed the worker's firing and condemned her outburst in a social media\u00a0statement.",
      "Cinnabon said in its statement that the worker was \"immediately terminated\" by the franchise owner over the viral video, which the company called \"disturbing.\" It posted the statement as a comment on the video on X, although the footage originally appeared on TikTok. The worker was not identified by name.",
      "\"We've seen the disturbing video from the Cinnabon bakery in Ashwaubenon, WI, and we do not condone this behavior,\" the statement said. \"The former employee was immediately terminated by the franchise owner. Their actions do not reflect our values or the welcoming experience every guest deserves.\"",
      "In a follow-up statement to the Associated Press, the company added: \"Their actions and statements are completely unacceptable and in no way reflect the values of Cinnabon, our franchisees, or the welcoming environment we expect for every guest and team member.\"",
      "The video was first posted on TikTok and showed a white, female employee cursing at and taunting the customers from behind the counter as one of them recorded the encounter. At one point, she is seen on video uttering a racial slur and saying, \"I am racist and I'll say it to the whole entire world. Don't be disrespectful.\"",
      "The employee was also recorded giving an obscene hand gesture at customers and exchanging expletives with one of the persons at the store.",
      "The TikTok user who posted the video said the incident happened while she and her husband were taking a break from shopping on Friday at a mall in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay.",
      "The customer said she ordered a caramel pecan cinnamon roll and had asked the worker to add more caramel, as it didn't appear to have enough.",
      "She said she began recording after the worker snapped at her and derided her hijab.",
      "An online fundraising campaign to support the customers described them as a \"black Somali Muslim couple\" who were \"traumatized\" by the incident.",
      "A competing campaign to purportedly benefit the fired worker, meanwhile, has raised tens of thousands of dollars. That effort appears on the same Christian crowdfunding platform where hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised for a Minnesota woman who admitted to using a racist slur against a Black child at a playground earlier this year.",
      "Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, addressed the incident in a statement on Monday.",
      "\"We welcome Cinnabon's decision to hold this employee accountable for her vile and racist rant against Black Muslim customers,\" Mitchell said. \"The fact that this employee felt comfortable calling a Black couple the n-word on camera is a sign of how acceptable anti-Black and anti-Somali racism has become. Our political leaders, including President Trump, must stop fomenting hatred against Americans of Somali descent.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure, with a majority of the justices appearing open to overturning a 90-year-old decision that shields some officials from removal without cause.",
      "The case, Trump v. Slaughter, arose from President Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling known as Humphrey's Executor upheld limits established by Congress that enabled the president to remove members of commissions like the FTC only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "The Trump administration argues those limits violate the separation of powers. The FTC wields executive power, so the president should have the authority to fire its members for any reason, it says. Slaughter's attorneys argue the removal protections fall within Congress' power to determine the structure of the government, and say the administration's position would allow the president to upend many other longstanding independent agencies and commissions that have been established by Congress.",
      "During oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, the three liberal justices defended the removal protections and warned that a decision in Mr. Trump's favor could cause chaos across the government. The court's conservatives, meanwhile, expressed skepticism with the argument that Congress could limit the president's ability to remove officials from the FTC and other independent agencies, opening the door to a ruling in the administration's favor.",
      "Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer presented the case for the administration. He urged the justices to overturn the decision in Humphrey's Executor, saying it encroaches on the president's removal authority under Article II of the Constitution.",
      "\"Humphrey's must be overruled. It has become a decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions. It was grievously wrong when it was decided,\" Sauer said. \"It continues to generate confusion in the lower courts, and it continues to tempt Congress to erect, at the heart of our government, a headless fourth branch, insulated from political accountability and democratic control.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, were skeptical of Sauer's argument.",
      "\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,\" Sotomayor said.",
      "She warned that a decision invalidating removal limits for members of the FTC could also put at risk the independence of other federal entities, such as the U.S. Tax Court and broader protections for the civil service. Slaughter's lawyers have warned that a ruling expanding presidential power over multi-member agencies could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, though the Supreme Court has indicated that it views the central bank differently.",
      "Kagan zeroed in on the impacts of a decision overturning Humphrey's Executor, raising the prospect that a ruling striking down the precedent could be used to target protections for officials across the government: \"The question is, where does this lead? Where does it take you to, given what your primary rationale is? Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century \u2026 Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way.\"",
      "She noted that independent agencies also wield legislative and judicial powers and warned that expanding the president's control over them would put \"massive uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president\" and leave the nation with a leader who then has \"control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking in this country.\"",
      "Jackson said that Sauer is \"asking us to infer\" that the removal protections are unconstitutional based on the structure of the Constitution, \"and I don't know why we'd make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.\"",
      "The court's conservatives were more receptive to the Trump administration's arguments.",
      "\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that \"a lot of legislative power has moved into these agencies,\" but said that \"if they're now going to be controlled by the president, it seems to me all the more imperative to do something about it.\"",
      "Attorney Amit Agarwal presented Slaughter's case, and argued that the removal protections have a long tradition in American history. He said that Congress has a role in limiting how officials on independent commissions like the FTC can be removed.",
      "\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" Agarwal said.",
      "Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas tested the boundaries of Agarwal's position, asking him whether Congress could transform Cabinet-level executive departments into multi-member commissions and limit the president's ability to fire their leaders. Agarwal said the Constitution would largely prohibit such a move, since Congress cannot limit the president's authority over officials who are wielding his \"conclusive and preclusive\" powers, which would apply to most departments.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito was similarly skeptical of Agarwal's argument, saying that \"I don't know that you can make the argument that the logic of [Sauer's] argument is going to cause these allegedly revolutionary results without being prepared to explain more concretely than you have the limits of your own argument.\"",
      "Agarwal added later: \"We have a 111-year-old statute that was enacted by the people's elected representatives. It was signed into law by a president of the United States. It was unanimously affirmed by this court. And it's been followed by every single president since 1935 until the present. We don't need an abstract theory to tell us that the FTC Act is OK. It's the other side that needs to give you a really compelling theory to explain why, in our view, 200-plus years of precedent and history need to be abandoned.\"",
      "Gorsuch continued to probe Agarwal's position, hinting that he thought the line Agarwal was trying to draw to limit the president's power to remove officials was unwieldy: \"How are we supposed to decide which powers are exclusive? \u2026 What powers are going to fall in and what are going to fall out? Are we going to have just as much litigation over that as anything else we might do in this case?\"",
      "The background of Trump v. Slaughter",
      "The case is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of that New Deal-era ruling in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have chipped away at that precedent. Most recently, the high court invalidated removal protections for leaders of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "But the Slaughter case now gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to overturn that 90-year-old precedent entirely.",
      "Since he returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the bounds of presidential power and moved to oust a host of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions, including Slaughter.",
      "Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by former President Joe Biden, Slaughter received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "Slaughter, like many other agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, filed a lawsuit arguing that her firing was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Her lawyers argue that Mr. Trump violated that law and Supreme Court precedent with the firing of Slaughter and a second commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya.",
      "A federal district court sided with Slaughter and ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks later, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated to her role at the FTC once again.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in late September to hear the case and allowed Mr. Trump to fire Slaughter while it considers the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the FTC.",
      "The Trump administration argued in filings that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. Removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, Sauer wrote.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power and said Congress could impose removal restrictions for multimember agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, like the FTC.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that since 1935, the FTC has accumulated executive powers. Today, the commission executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote in his filing.",
      "More than 200 Democrats in Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. They wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that over the past 100 years, 15 different presidents from both parties have signed bills into law that created independent agencies.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has already seen some success at the Supreme Court in his bid to assert more control over these bodies. The high court's conservative majority has allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause while legal challenges to their removals moved forward.",
      "The president has also attempted to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will hear arguments in that case next month.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump lambasted former ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Truth Social Monday morning, after the Georgia Republican told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" the president has forsaken his base.",
      "Once one of Mr. Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, Greene has become one of the few Republicans willing to speak out against him in public. As she prepares to resign from Congress before her term ends, Greene told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl the president isn't living up to his \"America First\" motto, and she connected death threats she says she has received with the president's comments about her.",
      "The president said the only reason Greene \"went BAD is that she was JILTED by the president of the United States.\"",
      "\"Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, calling Greene \"washed up\" and a \"low IQ traitor.\"",
      "The president also blasted Stahl, \"60 Minutes\" and the new ownership of Paramount, CBS's parent company, decrying the company's decision to \"allow a show like this to air.\" He added, \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\"",
      "Greene, who voted with Mr. Trump 98% of the time before their relationship began to deteriorate, has said she thinks the president failed to put domestic issues at the top of his agenda, and in her video announcing her resignation, criticized his support of both the crypto and pharmaceutical industries.",
      "Her relationship with Mr. Trump began to sour over records related to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was facing federal sex trafficking charges when he died by suicide in 2019.",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" that after the president called her a traitor, she received a bomb threat on her house \u2014 and then, \"several direct death threats on my son.\"",
      "Asked about her claim that the president was to blame for the threats to her and her son, Greene replied, \"The subject line for the direct death threats on my son was his words: \"Marjorie Traitor Greene.\"",
      "Greene told \"60 Minutes\" the threats were \"directly fueled by President Trump. And I told him. I told JD Vance. I told them all. Sent those directly to them.\"",
      "\"JD Vance replied back to me, 'We'll look into it,'\" Greene added. \"I got [a] response from President Trump that I will keep private, but it wasn't very nice.\"",
      "But when Stahl asked if the president ran her out of Congress, she said no.",
      "\"I will be no one's battered wife,\" she said.",
      "Stahl also asked about the solid support Mr. Trump nonetheless still enjoys among Republicans in Congress.",
      "\"I think they're terrified to step outta line and get a nasty Truth Social post on them,\" Greene said. Stahl asked, \"And they're watching what happened to you?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Greene replied.",
      "Last month, Greene apologized on CNN for what she said had been her role in contributing to America's often venomous political environment with her language. But she also sparred with Stahl over the issue on \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "Stahl asked Greene \"to respond to what you have done in terms of insulting people, yelling at people.\" Greene countered that Stahl was being \"accusatory.\" After Stahl responded, \"I don't insult people,\" Green told her, \"[Y]ou do in the way you question. And you are, you're accusing me right now.\"",

    "summary": "A suspect accused of stabbing a man on a Charlotte Area Transit System commuter train on Friday is undocumented and was previously deported, according to authorities.",
    "story": [
      "Another stabbing on a commuter train in\u00a0Charlotte, North Carolina, has drawn the attention of President Trump amid his administration's crackdown on immigration.",
      "The incident occurred on Friday after 33-year-old Oscar Solarzano allegedly entered the Charlotte Area Transit System's Blue Line light rail train and got into an argument with another passenger, according to authorities.",
      "It was the second stabbing on a Charlotte train since August, although this one was not fatal. The victim was in critical but stable condition, police said.",
      "\"It does not appear this was a random act of violence, but an altercation between two individuals that escalated,\" a transit spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday posted to Truth Social, reacting to the incident, \"Another stabbing by an Illegal Migrant in Charlotte, North Carolina. What's going on in Charlotte? Democrats are destroying it, like everything else, piece by piece!!!\"",
      "Solarzano was arrested nearby by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police on Friday evening and taken into custody, officials said. In court records from Solarzano's release hearing, a court appearance where a judge determines if a suspect can leave jail before trial, a magistrate noted Solarzano is undocumented and \"has been deported previously.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday said Solarzano was being charged with attempted first-degree murder \"after he stabbed a victim with a large knife.\" She also confirmed that Solarzano had been removed from the U.S. twice. Solarzano was ordered to remain in jail, according to court documents. It was unclear whether he has entered a plea.",
      "On Monday, a North Carolina judge ordered Solarzano, a Honduran man, to be held without bond, The Associated Press reported. He listened in court via video link, as a translator read charges of attempted first-degree murder, and assault with a deadly weapon and others. The public defender declined to comment, the AP reported.",
      "Before federal immigration authorities descended on Charlotte last month as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, Mr. Trump was among those who raised concerns about public safety in the city following the deadly stabbing of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on the light rail in August.",
      "Decarlos Brown Jr., a U.S. citizen with a history of mental illness, was arrested for the killing. He had been arrested more than a dozen times and was released earlier this year by a magistrate on a misdemeanor count without any bond. The death led North Carolina lawmakers to approve a criminal justice package dubbed \"Iryna's Law,\" limiting bail and seeking to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations.",
      "In a statement on Saturday, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, who opposed Mr. Trump sending federal agents to the city, said the city has \"invested heavily\" in public safety efforts in light of recent incidents.",
      "\"There are several aspects of public safety that are outside of the city's jurisdiction, including immigration policy and enforcement, but we will continue to focus on public safety and ensuring a safe and vibrant community,\" Lyles said.",
      "Despite local opposition and Charlotte's declining crime rates, Trump administration officials targeted the Democrat-run city, saying it was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "According to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News last month, fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent\u00a0immigration enforcement crackdown\u00a0in Charlotte were classified as criminals.",

    "summary": "Paramount Skydance's $30 per share offer comes just days after Netflix agreed to buy parts of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at nearly $83 billion.",
    "story": [
      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "Potential antitrust hurdle",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Paramount CEO David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

    "summary": "Former South Carolina court clerk Becky Hill has pleaded guilty to showing sealed court exhibits to a photographer and lying about it in court.",
    "story": [
      "The former court clerk in South Carolina who helped out with the murder trial of attorney Alex Murdaugh pleaded guilty Monday to criminal charges for showing sealed court exhibits to a photographer and lying about it in court.",
      "Former Colleton County Clerk of Court Mary Rebecca \"Becky\" Hill pleaded guilty in Colleton County Circuit Court to four charges \u2014 obstruction of justice and perjury for showing a reporter photographs that were sealed court exhibits and then lying about it \u2014 as well as two counts of misconduct in office for taking bonuses and promoting through her public office a book she wrote on the trial. All of the charges were felonies.",
      "Hill, 57, also faced a misdemeanor charge of perjury in Richland County, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release after her arrest earlier this year. Hill was taken into custody in May.",
      "Judge Heath Taylor sentenced Hill to a year of probation. The judge told Hill her sentence would have been much harsher if prosecutors had found that she had tampered with the Murdaugh jury.",
      "Hill read a short statement where she asked the judge for a chance to do better.",
      "\"There is no excuse for the mistakes I made. I'm ashamed of them,\" she said.",
      "Hill was in charge of taking care of the jury, overseeing exhibits and helping the judge during Murdaugh's six-week trial that ended with murder convictions for killing his wife and son. The case involved power, danger, money and privilege and an attorney whose family had lorded over his small South Carolina county for nearly a century.",
      "Murdaugh was convicted in 2023 of murdering his wife, Margaret \"Maggie\" Murdaugh, and his youngest son, Paul Murdaugh, on their South Carolina estate two years earlier. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, which he is currently serving along with another 27-year sentence for financial crimes.",
      "Hill has played a prominent part as Murdaugh appeals his convictions and life sentence. His lawyers have accused Hill of witness tampering during Murdaugh's 2023 trial, claiming she tried to influence jurors to vote guilty and saying she was biased against Murdaugh in her book. Hill has denied tampering with the jury.",
      "\"We are aware of the charges filed against Becky Hill and while these developments are serious, they are not surprising,\" Murdaugh's lawyers, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, said in a statement after Hill was charged. \"We have long raised our concerns about her conduct during and after the trial and this arrest further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process.\"",
      "During Monday's hearing, solicitor Rick Hubbard told the judge that a journalist told investigators that Hill showed graphic crime scene photos to several media members. He did not name the journalist.",
      "Murdaugh is also serving a separate sentence of decades in prison for admitting to stealing millions of dollars from settlements for clients who suffered horrible injuries or deaths \u2014 and from his family's law firm.",
      "An initial appeal by Murdaugh's lawyers was denied. But Judge Jean Toal said she wasn't sure Hill told the truth about her dealings with jurors and was \"attracted by the siren call of celebrity\" status.",
      "Some of Hill's charges concern Murdaugh's murder trial. The arrest warrant said Hill violated a judge's order to keep sealed photographs from the public. A second warrant said Hill lied to Toal during a January 2024 hearing when the judge asked: \"Did you allow anyone from the press to view the sealed exhibits?\"",
      "One of the charges \u2014 misconduct in office \u2014 involved money that investigators said Hill took for herself. They said that included nearly $10,000 meant for bonuses from federal money meant to improve child support collection and about $2,000 in money from the Clerk of Court's office.",
      "The warrant on the other misconduct charge said Hill used her public role as clerk of court to promote her book on the Murdaugh trial on social media.",
      "Hill was also accused last May of 76 counts of ethics violations. Officials said Hill allowed a photo of Murdaugh in a holding cell to be taken to promote her book on the trial and used county money to buy dozens of lunches for her staff, prosecutors and a vendor.",
      "Hill also struck a deal with a documentary maker to use the county courtroom in exchange for promoting her book on the trial, which later she admitted had plagiarized passages, according to the South Carolina Ethics Commission complaint.",
      "Hill resigned in March 2024 during the last year of her four-year term, citing the public scrutiny of Murdaugh's trial and wanting to spend time with her grandchildren.",

    "summary": "The Senate is set to vote on a Democratic health care proposal this week, a key tenet of the deal to end the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is set to take a long-anticipated vote on a Democratic health care proposal this week, a key tenet of the deal to end the government shutdown. But the measure is unlikely to secure the necessary support to advance in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, an issue that was at the center of Democrats' demands in the shutdown fight. The vote was part of an agreement to reopen the longest government shutdown in history, which came to an end when a group of eight Senate Democrats joined Republicans to end the impasse last month. That deal included a promise from GOP leaders to allow a vote on ACA subsidies during the second week of December.",
      "Democrats had the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice. And last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that the party will offer a clean three-year extension of the tax credits. Republicans have opposed an extension without reforms to the subsidies, which help millions of Americans pay for insurance on state-run exchanges. The credits expire at the end of the year.",
      "Some moderate senators sought a compromise position that would stand a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance. Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who was involved in the talks, said last week that \"it was an aspirational discussion, but it never got concrete.\"",
      "\"There was never an engaged discussion about how to extend these tax credits with specifics offered,\" Welch added.",
      "The planned measure is highly unlikely to pick up support from enough Republicans, although it will force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the idea that the bill is a \"nonstarter\" for Republicans.",
      "\"Thirteen votes could solve the problem. That's where the onus should be,\" Schumer said last week. \"They can just vote for this, plain and simple.\"",
      "Republicans have been highly critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise in the new year with the expiration of the tax credits, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension.",
      "Republicans rejected a similar, albeit shorter, extension during the shutdown. At the time, Schumer said Democrats would back a bill to quickly reopen the government if it included a one-year extension of tax credits. But GOP leaders insisted that lawmakers must reopen the government before negotiating on health care. And Senate Republicans made clear at the time that without protections for preventing taxpayer dollars from paying for abortions, the measure didn't stand a chance. The Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions, has been among the issues at the center of the health care impasse in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have been circling their own proposal to offer alongside the Democrat-led ACA extension. The move would alleviate pressure on GOP senators, and Republicans have outlined a number of ideas\u00a0aimed at addressing health insurance costs. But they have yet to coalesce behind a single approach, and may ultimately end up forgoing a bill of their own altogether.",
      "Some Senate Republicans have continued to engage in discussions on an extension of the tax credits with new limits on income and reforms to root out waste, fraud and abuse. But others have pushed for alternate proposals to address costs outside of the ACA framework. After President Trump voiced support for giving money directly to Americans over insurance companies, a handful of Republicans have outlined legislation to put funds into health savings accounts for consumers to use to pay for health care costs. Still, a single approach has yet to receive widespread support in the GOP conference.",
      "Without a plan, Senate Republicans' ideas may be pushed aside by their colleagues across the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in recent days that House Republicans will put forward a health care proposal this week, with a plan to vote on a health care bill by the end of the year.",
      "\"We've been saying from the very beginning, we're going to address this before the end of the year,\" Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"There will be big developments early next week, and we're right on track.\"",
      "Johnson said GOP leaders were \"walking members through this\" last week and would continue through the weekend, though he didn't provide details about the planned legislation.",
      "\"The Republican Party is the party with the ideas to fix health care,\" Johnson said.",
      "Patrick  Maguire and \n                                                  \n                      Seiji  Yamashita\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the secretary himself understands what he's referring to.",
      "We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And, actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the secretary of ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was \u2013 just for our audience, the Biden era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking.",
      "Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.",
      "We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're \u2013 you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the secretary of ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off?",

      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is something that, you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was, like, political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: So, you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman. And that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her.",
      "We do know that, when the money was stopped, they did sue the A.G. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should continue, that money\u2026",

      "But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the treasury secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced.",
      "If there was a linkage in that \u2013 the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with \u2013 with these \u2013 with these charges.",
      "And so I do know that, for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all \u2013 that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations.",

Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible.",
      "And, in this instance, you may have had bad guys. I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question.",
      "But, in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves.",
      "And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing, because, under the law \u2013 and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this \u2013 under the law, if someone has been struck and is \u2013 continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target.",
      "But if they are outside of combat, they are not, and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys \u2013 and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were \u2013 were barely alive\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD Law of War Manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the secretary of defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight.",
      "I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight, access to radios. There was a link-up point of another potential boat. Drugs were still there. They were actively interacting with them, had to take that reattack.",
      "I said: \"Roger. Sounds good.\"",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.",
      "But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow-up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was, a follow-up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation.",
      "That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then, when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves.",
      "Then, we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40-foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there.",
      "So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations, oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war.",
      "There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully \u2013 or I shouldn't even say boat. They watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike.",
      "So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And, frankly, I have no reason to doubt that.",
      "What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that, if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired, when he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal, et cetera.",
      "It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG lawyers observing all of this.",
      "On NBC this morning, he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Do you know, were these high-level cartel members?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they? If the U.S. had high confidence\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back \u2013 well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this.",
      "I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two. I don't know. But we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are.",
      "Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters, for the reason that you said.",
      "You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American Naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 the \u2013 the kingpins, as they say.",
      "What we're doing here is, we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right, which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins, who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest-level employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying they were not on an internal military target list for high-value individuals. That's what I hear what you're saying.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high-value targets, we designate individuals.",
      "I have no reason to believe, and, in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on a list anywhere. What we are doing \u2013 and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs.",
      "And, to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because - - and, look, they're saying this \u2013 because, if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So, no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be.",
      "You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen.",
      "Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals even without due process?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions.",
      "And you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were OK or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force.",
      "The original sin of this whole thing \u2013 whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then, in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right, often high-value targets, or HVTs, as we've referred to them.",
      "And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high-value target, in a jeep in Northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high- value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK-47, and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives.",
      "You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're going to take the strike, right? Now what we're doing \u2013 and, again, don't \u2013 I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying, that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so, presumably, that information should be shared with you if it does exist.",
      "I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago that Trump \u2013 a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen.",
      "The Pentagon inspector general said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private.",
      "In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right, that this report \u2013 and you read the key line, that this report that said that the secretary of defense put his troops and the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration.",
      "Now, I didn't hear the comment about: I would do this again.",
      "But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again \u2013 and, look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job.",
      "One of the most sensitive and difficult jobs to do in the United States government is being done by somebody who put his own people and the mission at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said he lives life without regret at the Reagan Forum. That was the phrase, to be more exact.",
      "But, Congressman Himes, always good to have you on the program. I will have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy, we're joined now by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and UnitedHealthcare.",
      "Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP, voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30-year-long policy regarding hepatitis B and newborns.",
      "They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is 2 months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes.",
      "Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours.",
      "For a child over the age of 5, if they develop hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95 percent chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity.",
      "For children between the ages of 1 and 5, they only have about a 25 to 50 percent chance of clearing the infection. So, about 25 to 50 percent of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of 1 and 5. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection.",
      "But, when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90 percent of newborns who become infected \u2013 and they'll become infected during delivery \u2013 will go on to develop chronic infection. They won't be able to clear the hepatitis B. And about 25 percent of them will die from sequelae of that infection either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer.",
      "So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's almost 99 percent effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2026",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point. The refrain is \u2013 oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States came out and said, this was very good because hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true.",
      "The fact is, there's a refrain that, if you just test the moms during \u2013 while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and, if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose.",
      "But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to. Many times, those test results aren't checked. And the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when, in fact, you do, of about 2 percent.",
      "That may not sound like a lot, but that 2 percent is going to translate into at least 1,000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated, in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, again, 25 percent of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration.",
      "And, in this board decision, which the public could listen into, it was publicly broadcast, the board was handpicked by RFK Jr., who is a skeptic here of vaccines. From those who voted against the decision to delay, one of them who you heard at the top of the show said, the CDC is doing harm.",
      "Another said: \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\"",
      "Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is \u2013 the ACIP, by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda.",
      "And, look, the secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization or many of these childhood immunizations.",
      "And I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error, insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision-making to. And what we're seeing right now is, as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored.",
      "I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP.",
      "The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, and not ACIP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think, in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision-making body, and it's going to be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There will be certain states that \u2013 that adhere to it, but it will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run at the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines.",
      "You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator Dr. Vinay Prasad are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines.",
      "What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B. This is the vaccines of the future you're saying just won't be created.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "So, Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the Biologics Center, also oversees the vaccine division, he also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the chief medical officer of the agency and chief scientific officer \u2013 so he occupies a lot of positions \u2013 put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with or move away from what they call immunobridging studies.",
      "These are studies that allow you, for well-validated vaccines like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine \u2013 the new vaccine that's formulated against a circulating strain can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza.",
      "For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a longstanding practice. It's \u2013 we do it for flu vaccine. We do it in COVID certainly. We do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes, circulating bacterial serotypes.",
      "This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening.",
      "That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the COVID vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said \u2013 and asked, did it kill more healthy kids than it saved?",
      "The administration to date has not backed up information to back up these claims, but \u2013 but what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner? Because they're arguing they're doing this to help people.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next.",
      "So, the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the COVID vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what their concerns are related to the COVID vaccine itself.",
      "These are \u2013 every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data.",
      "Analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves, are very subjective and require the good will the people involved in that.",
      "And so I think that they should make that analysis public\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in it.",
      "They've already backed away from the 10. There's reporting from Endpoints that now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 they're saying it's eight or nine. So, they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices convene to hear a case that could lead to the dismantling of protections meant to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

    "summary": "Minimum wages are set to rise in 22 U.S. states and 66 cities and counties next year, even as the federal baseline wage remains at $7.25.",
    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said Sunday as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",

    "story": [
      "Underwater archaeologists announced Monday they had discovered the 2,000-year-old wreck of an ancient Egyptian pleasure boat off the coast of Alexandria.",
      "Divers found the vessel's hull, which was more than 115 feet long and about 23 feet wide, submerged in the port of the island of Antirhodos, the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM)\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "There was Greek graffiti on the vessel that \"could date from the first half of the first century AD\" and \"supports the hypothesis that the ship was built in Alexandria.\"",
      "The boat \"would have had a luxuriously decorated cabin and appears to have been propelled solely by oars,\" the Alexandria-based institute added.",
      "Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria in 331 BC. A series of earthquakes and tidal waves that struck its coast submerged the island of Antirhodos, which was discovered in 1996.",
      "Over the years, divers have recovered statues, coins and other treasures there, with some on display at the Greco-Roman Museum in Alexandria.",
      "IEASM director Franck Goddio recently published a report on Antirhodos and its Temple of Isis, based on underwater exploration carried out since the 1990s.",
      "\"It's extremely exciting because it's the first time ever that such a boat has been discovered in Egypt,\" Goddio told the Guardian of the latest discovery. \"Those boats were mentioned by different ancient authors, like Strabo, and they were also represented in some iconography \u2013 for example, in the Palestrina mosaic, where you see such a boat of a much smaller size with noblemen hunting hippopotamuses. But [an actual boat] has never been discovered before.\"",
      "Future research on the recently discovered wreck \"promises to be a fascinating journey into the life, religion, wealth and waterway pleasures of ancient Roman Egypt,\" the institute said.",
      "Alexandria is home to ancient ruins and historic treasures, but Egypt's second-largest city is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels, sinking by more than three millimeters every year.",
      "Even in the United Nations' best-case scenario, a third of Alexandria will be underwater or uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "Multiple shipwrecks have been found in the bay, including the wreckage of Napoleon's fleet from the\u00a01798 Battle of the Nile. Earlier this year, a well-preserved boat measuring about 20 feet long was discovered by IEASM in the eastern harbor of Alexandria, according to a podcast posted by the\u00a0Hilti Foundation.",
      "In August, archaeologists announced that ancient statues, Roman coins and other artifacts from Alexandria were pulled from the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Authorities said that the site may be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, and the Roman Empire, which governed for around 600 years.",
      "The announcement of the pleasure boat discovery comes just days after archaeologists revealed that 225 funerary figurines were found inside a tomb in the ancient Egyptian capital of Tanis in the Nile Delta.",

      "A powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Japan late Monday, triggering a\u00a0tsunami of up to 27 inches in Pacific coast communities, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said. A tsunami warning was lifted early Tuesday, according to the Kyodo news agency.",
      "The quake struck at about 11:15 p.m. local time (9:15 a.m. EST) in the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main Honshu island, the agency said.",
      "A tsunami of 70 centimeters (about 27 inches) was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) struck other coastal communities in the region, the agency said.",
      "The agency had issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 10 feet in some areas. According to the Reuters news agency, the agency downgraded the tsunami warning to an advisory early Tuesday.",
      "The quake struck northeast of the Aomori town of Hachinohe, and about 30 miles below the sea surface, the meteorological agency said. Hachinohe residents fled their homes to seek shelter in city hall, public broadcaster NHK said.",
      "Several people were injured at a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in the town of Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole, NHK reported.",

      "A reporter for NHK in Hokkaido described a horizontal shaking of around 30 seconds that made him unable to keep standing as the earthquake struck.",
      "Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's president was likely to look for a strong show of support from his European partners on Monday after being admonished by President Trump, who accused him of not reading a White House-authored proposal to end Russia's ongoing war on his country.",
      "Speaking Sunday evening to reporters on the red carpet before the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, Mr. Trump said he was disappointed in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's response to the plan to end the nearly-four-year Russian invasion, while claiming Russia had backed the proposal.",
      "\"I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago,\" Mr. Trump said, adding: \"His people love it. But he hasn't \u2014 Russia's fine with it. Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it.\"",
      "Zelenskyy has not made any public comments about Mr. Trump's remarks. CBS News has reached out to Zelenskyy's team for comment.",
      "That assessment by Mr. Trump came despite a top Kremlin official telling journalists after talks last week in Moscow, between senior White House envoys and Vladimir Putin and his top aides, that they were, \"no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff then held meetings over the weekend in Florida with Ukrainian representatives. They said in a joint statement that \"both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday just hours before Zelenskyy met in London with the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany.",
      "The show of European unity was expected to see Zelenskyy continue his delicate diplomatic tightrope walk. He is embracing continued negotiations as he tries to keep Mr. Trump on his side and maintain critical U.S. intelligence and military support. He is also resisting White House pressure to accept a ceasefire deal that both Zelenskyy and his European backers say favors Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy previously said \"the main problem\" with the proposal was that it would legally recognize \"stolen\" territory occupied by Russian forces during the invasion, which European leaders have warned would set a dangerous precedent.",
      "Ukraine's leader will be keen to show he still has strong, unanimous backing from his European partners as negotiations continue over the still-ambiguous details of the U.S-brokered proposal.",
      "In addition to the impasse over Ukraine agreeing to formally cede territory to Russia, other sticking points in the talks include measures to ensure that Ukraine's security is guaranteed in the future, because of concerns Russia could try to invade again.",
      "The priorities for Ukraine and its European backers \u2014 to effectively undermine any ceasefire deal that Russia would legitimately be able to call a victory \u2014 appear to be at odds with some very basic tenets of White House policy, meanwhile.",

      "The Thai ministry of defense said that more than 35,000 people have left areas near the border for shelters and more are believed to have fled to stay with relatives elsewhere, while Cambodia's Information Minister Neth Pheaktra said that residents of several villages near the border have been evacuated.",
      "Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a televised speech that military operations would be carried out as necessary to defend the country and protect public safety.",

Both sides continue to trade accusations over responsibility, even as they are supposed to be cooperating in getting rid of the mines.",
      "Mr. Trump said in mid-November that he'd intervened to preserve the ceasefire as tensions simmered between the two countries.",
      "But another brief episode of fighting took place along the border Sunday, after which both sides said the other fired first. The Thai army said Cambodian fire injured two Thai soldiers, and Thai troops retaliated, resulting in an exchange of fire that lasted around 20 minutes. Cambodia said that the Thai side fired first and that its own troops did not retaliate.",
      "On Monday, Thai army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree said the Cambodian troops fired first into Thai territory in multiple areas. He said one Thai soldier was killed and four other soldiers were wounded, and civilians were being evacuated from the affected areas.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who now serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy. We're joined now by former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30 year long policy regarding Hepatitis B and newborns. They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is two months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours. For a child over the age of five, if they develop Hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95% chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity. For children between the ages of one and five, they only have about a 25 to 50% chance of clearing the infection, so about 25 to 50% of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of one and five. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection. But when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90% of newborns who become infected, and they'll become infected during delivery, will go on to develop chronic infection, they won't be able to clear the hepatitis B, and about 25% of them will die from sequelae of that infection, either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer. So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract Hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection, it's almost 99% effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2013",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point, the refrain is, oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States came out and said, this was very good, because Hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true. The fact is, there's a refrain that if you just test the moms during, while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose. But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to, many times, those test results aren't checked, and the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when in fact, you do, of about 2 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but that 2% is going to translate into at least 1000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B, and again, 25% of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration and in this board decision, which the public could listen into. It was publicly broadcast. The board was hand picked by RFK Jr, who is a skeptic here of vaccines, from those who voted against the decision to delay. One of them who you heard at the top of the show said the CDC is doing harm. Another said, \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\" Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is the ACIP by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda. And look, the Secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization, or many of these childhood immunizations, and I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision making to, and what we're seeing right now is as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored. I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP. The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and not ACIP. So I think in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision making body, and it's going to be more symbolic. There will be certain states that- that adhere to it, but will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines. You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines. What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B, this is the vaccines of the future. You're saying just won't be created?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the biologic center. Also oversees the vaccine Division. He also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the Chief Medical Officer of the agency, and chief scientific officer. So he occupies a lot of positions. Put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with, or move away from, what they call immuno bridging studies. These are studies that allow you for well validated vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine, the new vaccine, that's formulated against the circulating strain, can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza. For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a long standing practice. It's, we do it for flu vaccine, we do it in covid Certainly, we do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes circulating bacterial serotypes. This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change, and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the Fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said, they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening. That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the Covid vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said and asked, Did it kill more healthy kids than it saved? The administration, to date, has not backed up information to back up these claims, but, but, what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner, because they're arguing they're doing this to help people?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next. So the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the covid vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what the concerns are related to the covid vaccine itself. These are- every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves are very subjective and require the goodwill the people involved in that. And so I think that they should make that analysis public so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in that they've already backed away from the 10 is reporting from endpoints that now they're saying it's eight or nine, so they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out. Dr Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Connecticut. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of the few lawmakers shown the classified version of this September 2 video of the U.S. strikes an alleged drug boat near Venezuela, four strikes in total, we have learned. You met with Admiral Bradley, who commands special operations as well. The President of the United States says he is open to this video being made public. Do you think it is essential that it become public, and are you confident it will be?",
      "REP. HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself. I know how the public is going to be react- is going to react because I felt my own reaction. You know, I've spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaking- shaken, and I think it's important for Americans to see it. Because, look, there's a certain amount of there's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it- why did it shake you so much? What specifically was bothering you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, and this is sort of the distinction, and there's a lot to unpack here about whether this is an authorized military action, which it is not, and right on down to whether these were legitimate- legitimate targets, and they were not. But let me go back to some of the reviews I've done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible. And in this instance, you may have had bad guys, I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question. But in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves. And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing. Because under the law, and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this, under the law, if someone has been struck and is- continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target. But if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys, and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were, were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD law of war manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the Secretary of Defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight. I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH ON TAPE: A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight. Access to radios, there was a link up point of another potential boat, drugs were still there, they were actively interacting with them. Had to take that reattack. I said, Roger, sounds good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was, but Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was a follow up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation. That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves. Then we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40 foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there. So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations. Oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war. There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully, or I shouldn't even say, boat, they watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike. So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REP. HIMES: You know Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And frankly, I have no reason to doubt that. What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired. When he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal in [unintelligible]. It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG law- lawyers observing all of this. On NBC this morning he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization. Do you know, were these high level cartel members?",
      "REP. HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they, if the U.S. had high confidence--",
      "REP. HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back- well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this. I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two, I don't know, but we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are. Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters for the reason that you said. You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders, the- the kingpins, as they say. What we're doing here is we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right? Which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest level employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you saying they were not on an internal military target list for high value individuals. That's what I hear, what you're saying.",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals. Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high value targets. We designate individuals. I have no reason to believe, and in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on the list anywhere. What we are doing, and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs, and to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because- and look, they're saying this, because if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be. You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen. Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals, even without due process?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions, and you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were okay or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force. The original sin of this whole thing, whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right? Often high value targets, or HVTs as we've referred to them. And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high value target, in a jeep in northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK 47 and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives. You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're gonna take the strike. Right now what we're doing, and again, don't- I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so presumably that information should be shared with you if it does exist. I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago, the Trump- a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen. The Pentagon Inspector General said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REP. HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private. In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right? That this report, and you read the key line, that this report that said that the Secretary of Defense put his troops in the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration. Now, I didn't hear the comment about I would do this again. But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again- and look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job. One of the most sensitive and difficult jobs to do in the United States government is being done by somebody who put his own people and the mission at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 He said he lives life without regret at the Reagan Forum, that was the phrase, to be more exact. But Congressman Himes, always good to have you on the program. I'll have to leave it there for today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Welcome to the program.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "REP. OMAR: We have a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on where the Treasury Secretary just left off. He alleged that people who were tied to you or your campaign were involved in this broad, brazen scheme to rip off the Minnesota state welfare system. Do you want to respond to that? Do you know what he is referring to?",
      "REP. OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the Secretary himself understands what he's referring to. We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of Ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was just for our audience. The Biden-era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID-era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking. Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REP. OMAR: I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota. We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also as Minnesotans as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, and that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the Secretary of Ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off? And it is something that you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was like political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REP. OMAR: So you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman, and that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her. We do know that when the money was stopped, they did sue the AG. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should contin- that money should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those, those alarms, and we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue, and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the Treasury Secretary say they're investigating. But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the Treasury Secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REP. OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced. If there was a linkage in that, the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with- with these, with these charges. And so I do know that for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all- that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations. But if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know and we want those people prosecuted, and we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are 80,000 people of Somali descent in your state, but the President has been very focused not just on them, but on you. In this extraordinary cabinet meeting, he said, Somalis, quote, \"come from hell.\" \"They complain and they do nothing but bitch.\" Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they've got nothing.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \u2026We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.\"",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That knocking is vehement agreement from his Cabinet members there. I just wonder what the reaction is in your district to have that from the highest office in the land.",
      "REP. OMAR: It's disgusting. It's completely disgusting. These are Americans that he is calling garbage. And we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me. I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 95% of the Somalis in your state are U.S. citizens.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes.",
      "MARAGARET BRENNAN: Just for clarity there. But the president has restricted all immigration processing, including asylum claims from Somalis already on U.S. soil, along with 18 other countries. ICE reports it has rounded up about 19 people, and they put out press releases with the images of about five of them that they say are the worst of the worst is that the entirety of the crackdown to date?",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, so far we know of the people that they have picked up in Minnesota, about five of them are Somalis, and from what I have read and from the people that I've spoken to, all of them had already had orders of removal. So these are not people who are undocumented, but people who have committed crimes and who should have already been sent out of the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something else that the architect of the President's immigration policy, Stephen Miller, said. On Thanksgiving day he posted, \"No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions. and terrors, of their broken homelands.\"",
      "What do you make of this argument of failure to assimilate and sort of ruining America. How do you understand this?",
      "REP. OMAR: I mean, when I think about Stephen Miller and his white supremist rhetoric, it reminds me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's how you hear it--",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes, it reminds me of the way the Nazis described Jewish people in Germany. And you know, as we know, there have been many immigrants who have tried to come to the United States who have turned back, you know, one of them being Jewish immigrants. We know the way that people were described who were coming from Ireland, Irish immigrants. We know the way in which people were described back then, when there were Italian immigrants. And to me, you know, we're, we're, yes, of course, ethnically Somali, we are in this country as Americans, we are citizens, we are a productive part of this nation, and we will continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Morning, Margaret.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the President described back in April, what to expect from this season.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the President's prediction then, correct?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the- you know, we've seen across all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4- 4% GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3% real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka Trucks, their CEO, said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation, it was 30 bucks the year before that, 25. Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The PC- the PCE number which is about 2.9%. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from for example, the President, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS. 60% of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are, and his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36% in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, 32%. Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the President's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --No, no- yeah, but I think the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage. And I will tell you that affordability has two components, there is inflation, and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1% and what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day. I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The- we've made a lot of gains, but remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it's Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal, toxic Paul Krugman at New York Times or former Vice Chair, Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession. The American people don't know how good they have it. Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or over regulation, that we are now seeing the- this. affordability problem, and I think next year we're going to move on to prosperity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Oh, I think the Biden administration created a terr--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now we're nearly 12 months in, you said the President would own the economy at this point.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time. And we have pulled that number down- that Strategas research does something called the common man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20%. Their index showed 35. This year for the first time, the common man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent is coming down. So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration, interest rates and inflation. Immigrant- mass, unfettered immigration, depressed wages caused housing prices to go up. President has closed the border that is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020 and now we are working on inflation, and I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3% compared to last September. The President seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices. Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, nothing- nothing the Biden administration did worked--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because this isn't the same thing. If they- if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front, and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Not- not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural Secretary just said that the President is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short term relief while you're working on these- finalizing these trade packages. There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular, I know you spoke with China's Vice Premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15% since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons. But Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one, you invest in it.",
      "SE. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest in--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --People in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the- my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business. But I probably know more about any Treasury Secretary than- about agriculture since the 1800s and I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty, and we have put that in place with this trade deal. 12 and a half million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years, for soybeans, also sorghum, the- and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year, because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, for the- for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yep.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. But why- if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department, then?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations. And we are going to create this bridge because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump accounts, and building on this concept so parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids, their tax deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028. So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for college tuition or their first house, is that right?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No, it is- the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump accounts, it will be invested in a widely diversified, low cost index, and then it will be available--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: So in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so there was also a broadening of this- this past week, with the Dell Foundation making a significant investment in the American children. So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market. As Warren Buffett says, don't- don't bet against the American stock market, don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own. The incredible gift by Michael and Susan Dell will be the- is a program that philanthropists' foundations can do to top up these accounts. And we are expecting, we're already at- Treasury is already in discussions with foundations, with major philanthropists to top up these accounts. It could either be for all children, or you can specify it by zip code, a school district, or you can do what the Dells did, and say that it will be- won't apply to the zip codes of the top 20% of earners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And more information is going to be coming out on how to use this and access it?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, in the coming weeks, we'll do that, and then the official kickoff will be July 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about this massive fraud out in Minnesota, and the state welfare program has been under federal investigation since all the way back in 2022. The President told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who, quote, ripped off that state for billions of dollars. He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS for which I'm the Acting Commissioner- is discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit. This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the- from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government- Governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to AG Ellison, but they've been transferred to something called MBs--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mortgage backed securities, what--?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transferred to what?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: These are money- the- bureau services, and they are wire transfer organizations that are outside the regulated banking system, and that money has gone overseas, and we are tracking that- the- both to the Middle East and Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you have no evidence of that money being used to fuel terrorism, which is what some conservative writers are alleging?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: That's why it's an investigation. We started it last week. We'll see where it goes. But I can tell you that, you know, it's terrible. You know, Representative Omar tried to downplay it. Said, oh, it was very- the- it was very tough to know how this money should- should be used. She was gaslighting the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll talk to her.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yeah. But, you know, when you come to this country, you got to learn which side of the road to drive on. You got to learn to stop at stop signs, and you got to learn the- not to defraud the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are plenty of- plenty of criminal behavior from communities well beyond the immigrant community, but we'll talk about this with Representative Omar shortly. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "summary": "A zoo on Java island has released photos of Indonesia's first locally born giant panda cub.",
    "story": [
      "A zoo on Java island released photos of Indonesia's first locally born giant panda cub, and said the male cub was showing signs of being in good health.",
      "The mother, 15-year-old Hu Chun, gave birth to Satrio Wiratama \u2014 nicknamed Rio \u2014 on November 27 at the zoo's facility in Cisarua, West Java province.",
      "The name symbolizes the hope, resilience, and shared commitment of Indonesia and China in protecting endangered species, Taman Safari Indonesia said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"This birth is the result of a long-term international cooperation program that has been ongoing for a decade, since the arrival of giant pandas Hu Chun and Cai Tao to Indonesia in 2017 as part of a 10-year conservation partnership with China,\" said the statement.",
      "Rio is in stable condition and under 24-hour monitoring by the zoo's team, showing healthy early signs such as strong vocalization, effective nursing and steady weight gain. Over the next one to two months, he is expected to develop better temperature control, fur growth, open his eyes and begin early motor movements, the zoo said.",
      "\"At this early stage, the baby panda is not yet accessible to the public. Taman Safari Indonesia will continue to prioritize the health and welfare of the mother and her baby, and invites the public to join in praying for the baby panda's development so that it remains healthy and safe in the early stages of its life,\" it said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced the baby panda's name on Thursday and showed his photo when he met Wang Huning, a top Chinese political advisor and leading ideologist.",
      "Cai Tao and Hu Chun, a pair of giant pandas who arrived in Indonesia in 2017, live in a \"palace-like\" home that was built for them at the Taman Safari zoo, which is located around 43 miles from Jakarta.",
      "Pandas are widely considered China's unofficial national mascot, and its giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy, also known as \"panda diplomacy.\"",
      "Giant pandas have difficulty breeding, and births are particularly welcomed. There are fewer than 1,900 giant pandas in their only wild habitats in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu.",
      "These pandas live primarily in forests in the mountains of southwestern China. Concerns over dwindling panda populations peaked during the early aughts, triggering conservation efforts that eventually led to their reclassification as \"vulnerable,\" rather than \"endangered,\" species just a few years ago.",
      "\"The living conditions of China's rare and endangered species have seen notable improvements amid the country's active efforts on biodiversity protection and ecological restoration,\" China's\u00a0State Council Information Office\u00a0said in 2021, when the country announced giant pandas were no longer endangered as more than 1,800 were living in the wild.",
      "Bringing giant pandas back from the brink of extinction has been a priority for scientists, especially in recent years, and learning how to keep baby pandas alive has been a big part of their quest to successfully do that. As 60 Minutes reported in 2020, raising a baby panda takes a lot of work.",
      "Because pandas' gestation periods are short, babies are born small, weighing just a few ounces. Newborns are pink, hairless and cannot open their eyes for weeks.",

      "Netanyahu also said he will meet with U.S. President Trump later this month to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for confirmation of the meeting and additional meetings. The two leaders have met at least three times since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term in January.",
      "The first phase of the U.S. peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Concerns remain over the force's role and makeup.",
      "Netanyahu stressed that the second phase of the ceasefire, the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza, could begin as soon as the end of the month. The remains of Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023 and whose body was taken to Gaza, have not yet been returned.",
      "\"And now we have a second phase, no less daunting, and that is to achieve the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza,\" Netanyahu said. \"There's a third phase, and that is to deradicalize Gaza, something that also people believed was impossible. But it was done in Germany, it was done in Japan, it's done in the Gulf states, can be done in Gaza too.\"",
      "Arab and Western officials told The Associated Press on Friday that an international body overseeing the ceasefire, to be led by Mr. Trump himself, is expected to be appointed by the end of the year. In the long term, the plan also calls for a possible \"pathway\" to Palestinian independence.",

      "The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when\u00a0Hamas-led terrorists\u00a0entered Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking over 250 people hostage. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration says societal threats mean some European nations may not be \"strong enough to remain reliable allies.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration claims in its new National Security Strategy, published early Friday morning, that some of America's oldest allies in Europe face \"the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\" due to immigration and the purported erosion of democratic principles.",
      "Accusing the European Union and other unnamed transnational bodies of allowing unchecked immigration and curbing free speech, the document claims that, \"should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,\" and that \"it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies\" to the United States.",
      "The document claims Europe suffers from a \"lack of self-confidence\" that \"is most evident in Europe's relationship with Russia.\"",
      "It says that European countries have a \"significant hard power advantage\" over Russia, but because of Russia's war in Ukraine, they now \"regard Russia as an existential threat.\"",
      "President Trump recently proposed a plan to end the brutal war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was drafted without Ukrainian or European involvement and largely reflected Russian demands.",
      "The plan drew a careful diplomatic response from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and from America's NATO allies, which have been trying to show a united front and continue supporting Kyiv's defensive efforts.",
      "The National Security Strategy attacks the positions of some European governments on Ukraine, accusing unspecified officials of holding \"unrealistic expectations for the war\" as they lead \"unstable minority governments\" in their own countries.",
      "The White House strategy makes the unsubstantiated claim that the populations of some European countries want an end to the war, but that their governments are subverting democratic processes and not delivering it.",
      "The document says \"it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.\"",
      "Some of the sentiments in the strategy document, particularly on the purported erosion of free speech rights in Europe, echo remarks delivered by Vice President JD Vance at a security conference in Germany early this year. He berated European leaders and accused some American allies of politically censoring right-wing ideas within their own nations.",
      "The 33-page document breaks down American foreign policy for five broad regions: the Western Hemisphere, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "The strategy notes the reestablishment of strategic stability with Russia, enabling Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defense, and \"ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance\" among other U.S. priorities.",
      "The document does say Europe remains \"strategically and culturally vital to the United States,\" and that America's \"goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory.\"",

One interdiction took place 90 nautical miles from Barranquilla, a city on Colombia's northern coast, and the other one occurred about 70 miles south of that in the Gulf of Morrosquillo.",

      "The latest strike comes as Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny in the wake of a recent Washington Post report\u00a0over a Sept. 2 boat strike\u00a0in the Caribbean\u00a0that killed 11 people. The report claimed the U.S. military struck the boat with two missiles, a revelation that the White House confirmed.\u00a0A source familiar with the matter\u00a0told CBS News on Wednesday that the second strike came as two people who survived the first missile were trying to climb back onto the boat. The survivors were allegedly trying to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. Some lawmakers have questioned whether the second strike constitutes a war crime.",
      "In an exclusive conversation with CBS News in October, Petro said some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "The White House denies those accusations, and President Trump has defended the strikes as a legitimate part of his fight against drug trafficking gangs.",

      "5. Advanced lipid profile",
      "Dr. Jeremy M. Liff, a board-certified neurologist in New York, puts this test at the top of his list.",
      "\"Unlike a standard cholesterol panel, which only gives you HDL (\u2018good\u2019 cholesterol) and LDL (\u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol), the advanced version breaks down the specific types of LDL particles,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Some LDL particles are far more dangerous than others.\"",

      "\"This test gives men over 40 a much clearer picture of their cardiovascular risk and whether they need major dietary or lifestyle changes,\" he said. \"By identifying dangerous LDL particle types early, men can intervene before plaque buildup becomes life-threatening.\"",
      "The advanced lipid profile helps to prevent \"catastrophic\" cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, according to a doctor. (iStock)",
      "The advanced lipid profile may only need to be done once if the baseline looks excellent, according to the doctor. If results are poor, men should repeat the test every six months under their doctor\u2019s guidance, he advised.",
      "Major health organizations \u2014 including the ACC, AHA, Endocrine Society and USPSTF \u2014 regard advanced lipid profiles as optional decision-support tools rather than standard screening tests.",
      "6. Thyroid function",
      "This blood test can be done yearly to evaluate how well your thyroid gland is functioning, according to Caamano.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "MEN MAY NEED TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS WOMEN TO PREVENT POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASE",
      "The test measures levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland and tells the thyroid how much hormone to produce. It also measures levels of free T4 (the main hormone the thyroid releases) and free T3 (the active form that the body converts T4 into).",
      "Based on these three levels, a doctor can determine whether the thyroid is underactive or overactive.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" one doctor cautioned. (iStock)",
      "Major health agencies, such as the USPSTF, American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American College of Physicians, recommend this test for people who are at higher risk of thyroid disease, are experiencing symptoms or have autoimmune conditions.",
      "7. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)",
      "A PSA blood test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by both normal and cancerous cells of the prostate gland.",
      "This test, sometimes along with a digital rectal exam, is used to screen for cancer or enlargement of the prostate, according to Caamano.",

      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems. (iStock)",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Detecting it early allows men to make changes that protect long-term organ health, including the brain,\" Liff said. \"Depending on the initial findings, a repeat every six months may be appropriate.\"",
      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",
      "\"These are done when men are having symptoms such as low libido, fatigue, breast enlargement or when they are using TRT,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",
      "10. Omega-3 index",
      "Cardiologist Wolfson, who is also founder of Natural Heart Doctor, a holistic cardiology practice, calls this test \"the most powerful predictor of heart attack and sudden death risk\" \u2014 though it\u2019s not yet part of standard screening guidelines for everyone.",
      "Low omega-3 levels, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a range of medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, poor cognition, mood disorders and more, studies have shown.",
      "Omega-3 fatty acids, or fish oil, \"were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks,\" the researchers found. (iStock)",
      "\"The omega-3 index is a direct measurement of omega-3 levels inside red blood cells, making it far more meaningful than a standard blood omega-3 test,\" Wolfson told Fox News Digital.",
      "He recommends that men 40 and older get the test once per year \u2014 \"or every six months if supplementing and optimizing.\"",
      "HEART SURGEON REVEALS WHAT TO EAT (AND NOT EAT) FOR OPTIMAL CARDIAC HEALTH",
      "However, major health agencies like the AHA and the National Institutes of Health do not recommend routine omega-3 index testing for the general population, as the test is mainly used for patients with cardiovascular disease who are already considering omega-3 supplementation.",
      "11. Carotid artery ultrasound",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, according to Liff. The carotid artery ultrasound can reveal problems long before symptoms appear, potentially protecting brain health.",
      "It may be considered in some high-risk men or when a doctor suspects carotid disease.",
      "\"Reduced blood flow from plaque buildup can trigger strokes or transient ischemic attacks,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Catching the narrowing early allows for treatment, lifestyle changes or close monitoring before a serious event occurs.\"",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, an expert noted. (iStock)",
      "If there is no evidence of disease, Liff recommends repeating the test every few years. \"If narrowing is detected, a specialist should follow the patient more closely,\" he advised.",
      "The USPSTF, AHA, American Stroke Association (ASA) and ACC only recommend the carotid artery ultrasound when there are neurological symptoms or high clinical suspicion of carotid disease based on medical history.",
      "12. Colon cancer screening",
      "The USPSTF, ACS and CDC now recommend screening average-risk adults for colon cancer from the ages of 45 to 75.",
      "Men with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin screenings at 40, Caamano noted. Those with a low risk level should begin screenings at 45, via colonoscopy or an at-home stool test.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"A colonoscopy should be done every 10 years unless polyps are found, which then drops the time to every three to five years \u2014 or for those with a family history of colorectal cancer, every five years,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"This screening is super important, as early detection can be lifesaving.\"",
      "13. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)",
      "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a blood test that detects low levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation in the body.",
      "Wolfson refers to this test as the \"inflammation alarm bell. \"Chronic inflammation is a major driver of heart disease, strokes, cancer, dementia, diabetes and accelerated aging,\" he told Fox News Digital, calling \"hs-CRP \u2018the single best early warning sign.\u2019\"",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "The test helps to detect silent cardiovascular inflammation, early artery damage, hidden infections and inflammatory lifestyle triggers, such as poor sleep, stress, alcohol and toxins, Wolfson noted.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "He recommends that men in their 40s and older get the test every six months, or more frequently if levels are elevated or if symptoms are present. Per major health agencies, however, there is insufficient evidence that hs-CRP should be routinely performed unless someone experiences symptoms or is at intermediate cardiovascular risk.",
      "14. Vitamin D",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to Wolfson.",
      "Low levels are linked to heart disease, cancer, autoimmune conditions, high blood pressure, depression, low testosterone, poor immune resilience and early aging, according to the doctor.",
      "\"It is one of the strongest indicators of lifestyle quality, including sun exposure, sleep habits, metabolic health and inflammation,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Levels may be low in men who avoid the sun or overuse sunscreen.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Wolfson recommends vitamin D testing twice per year, ideally in the winter and summer, to capture seasonal changes.",

      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",

      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",
      "There is also an increase in connectivity, which enhances cognitive development and learning, the study found.",
      "The first era of brain development occurs between birth and 9 years old, involving an influx in neuron connectors and brain matter. (iStock)",
      "These developments peak in the early 30s, which is defined as the \"strongest topological turning point\" of the entire lifespan.",
      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, the progressive firebrand and frequent foil of President Donald Trump, is expected to launch a U.S. Senate campaign on Monday, which is the deadline for candidates to file for the state's March 3 primary.",
      "Hours before Crockett \u2014 a rising star Democrat with a large social media imprint who represents a Dallas area district \u2014 was to hold an event announcing her decision, one of the two Democrats already running for the Senate abandoned his bid.",
      "Former Rep. Colin Allred, who was making his second straight bid for the Senate in right-leaning Texas, announced he was ending his campaign and instead would launch a congressional campaign as he seeks to return to the House. But Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, a former middle school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian, remains in the Senate primary, setting up a likely face-off between two surging contenders with formidable fundraising.",
      "If Crockett launches a Senate campaign as expected, it would further rock a high-profile and heavily contested race, which, on the Republican side, includes Sen. John Cornyn and GOP primary rivals Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. House Rep. Wesley Hunt. The contest in Texas is one of the most closely watched Senate showdowns as Democrats try to win back the chamber's majority in next year's midterms.",
      "EX-NFL STAR ABANDONS SENATE BID AS JASMINE CROCKETT NEARS MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT",
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a two-term Democratic House member from Texas, is likely on Monday to launch a 2026 campaign for the U.S. Senate.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Crockett told CNN this weekend that she's made out two cashier checks, one if she jumps into the Senate campaign and one to submit if she files for re-election in the House.",
      "And her down-to-the-wire announcement is scheduled for 90 minutes before the final deadline to submit one of the checks.",
      "Crockett has teased a possible Senate run for weeks, telling MS NOW on Sunday that \"I am closer to yes than I am to no.\" And she has said she's commissioned polling to make her case for a Senate run in Texas, where no Democrat has won a statewide election in over three decades.",
      "In another sign that she's expected to launch a Senate run, Crockett told the Dallas Morning News that she called both Allred and Talarico to discuss her polling.",
      "BIG WIN FOR TRUMP, GOP, AS SUPREME COURT GREENLIGHTS NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP IN TEXAS",
      "Monday's filing deadline comes just a few days after the Supreme Court upheld a new congressional map passed by the GOP-dominated Texas legislature and signed into law by longtime Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that creates five more right-leaning House districts in the Lone Star State.",
      "And one of the Texas Democrats whose district had been dramatically altered, Rep. Marc Veasey, had reportedly been discussing with Crockett a plan where he would file for her current House seat shortly after she files to run for the Senate.",
      "Former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas announced on Monday that he would abandon his 2026 U.S. Senate campaign and instead run to return to the House. (Reuters/Marco Bello)",
      "Allred, who was making a second straight Senate bid after losing to conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz by roughly 9 points last year, said in a statement that he didn't want to contribute to anything that would splinter Democrats' hopes of flipping the GOP-held Senate seat in next year's elections.",
      "\"In the past few days, I\u2019ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,\" Allred wrote.",
      "By dropping out of the race, Allred will likely allow Democrats to avoid a costly and messy primary runoff in the spring, giving the party more time to consolidate around their nominee and raise much-needed campaign cash.",
      "Meanwhile, with Cornyn, Paxton, and Hunt all taking aim at each other in a combustible primary, the GOP nomination may be headed towards a runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate tops 50% in the primary.",

      "CROCKET SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGN CASH ON THIS",
      "The 44-year-old Crockett, who is Black, is a former state representative and civil rights lawyer. She won her seat in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, who was retiring, hand-picked her as his successor in Congress.",
      "Crockett, who won re-election last year, has become one of the most well-known Democratic politicians in the country the past couple of years, thanks to her viral jabs at Republicans and her verbal sparing on social media with Trump, who has repeatedly questioned her intelligence. And she's grabbed plenty of headlines during her time on the House Oversight Committee.",
      "While her expected Senate run will likely excite many Democrats, thanks to her energy and her proven fundraising ability, her frequent push-back against GOP politicians may energize Republicans.",
      "Among her biggest blunders \u2014 calling Abbott, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, \"Gov. Hot Wheels.\"",
      "Crockett has also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler on multiple occasions while accusing aspects of the Republican Party of fascism.",
      "She notably ran for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee earlier this year following the death of its previous top Democrat, the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., but dropped out of the race after failing to win the recommendation of leadership within her party.",
      "But the Dallas-area Democrat has won favor with some party leaders, like ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, who revealed in her memoir \"107 Days\" that she mentored Crockett as part of her covert \"Stars Project\" while in office.",
      "Crockett spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year when Harris was named the party's presidential candidate, a notable slot for someone who was then a first-term House lawmaker.",
      "She had also been facing some tough decisions in her House race after the new GOP-led Texas congressional map appeared to draw her home out of her current district.",
      "Crockett's expected entry into the Senate race will shift the spotlight off of the GOP primary, where Cornyn, the longtime incumbent who hails from the party's establishment wing, has cut into the one-time large lead by Paxton, a MAGA firebrand, with Hunt in third.",

      "The concern among Republicans is that Paxton, who has been battered over the past decade by a slew of scandals and legal problems and who is now dealing with a messy divorce, would put the seat in play if he won the GOP nomination.",

      "But a Crockett candidacy would likely change the political equation.",
      "While her aggressive push-back against Trump and the GOP would play well with the left, it could deflate her chances of winning next November among Texas' general election electorate.",
      "The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, this past summer paid for a Democratic primary poll in Texas which showed Crockett the frontrunner by double digits. The publicly released survey was apparently done to encourage Crockett to enter the race, with the GOP assuming she would be more beatable than Allred or Talarico.",

      "During Monday's oral arguments, justices for the conservative 6-3 majority appeared poised to side with Trump in allowing him to proceed with firing Slaughter, despite concerns from liberal justices, who cited concerns about discarding a nearly 100-year-old precedent and eliminating more guardrails for the commander-in-chief.",

      "U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, arguing for the Trump administration, urged the Supreme Court at the outset of oral arguments to overturn Humphey's, which he assailed as an \"indefensible outlier\" and \"decaying husk\" of a Supreme Court decision that has \"not withstood the test of time.\"",
      "Lawyers for ousted FTC member Rebecca Slaughter countered that overturning the 1935 ruling altogether would mean that \"everything is on the chopping block,\" both for leaders of the FTC and for other multi-member federal agencies created by Congress. Other civil servants could also be impacted, they warned.",
      "As arguments drew to a close, it remained unclear how the high court might rule. Most conservatives appeared to disagree with the notion that Congress should be able to block a president's ability to fire federal regulators \u2014 even as they grappled with the risks of completely overturning the 1935 court decision entirely.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts used his time to press parties on how modern-day FTC powers have changed since the court's original ruling.",
      "Humphrey's, he said, is. therefore \"addressing an agency that had very little, if any, executive power,\" he said, \"and that may be why they were able to attract such a broad support on the court at the time.\"",
      "Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0alo seemed to entertain the possibility of further narrowing protections for agency heads\u00a0under Humphrey\u2019s, if not overturning it altogether, and pressed counsel for the Trump administration on what \"limiting\" principles might apply.",
      "President Donald Trump points a finger during an announcement at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10, 2025. (Kent Nishimura/Reuters)",
      "Liberal justices on the court appeared skeptical of Sauer\u2019s claim that Trump has the power to fire the heads of independent federal agencies, citing concerns that allowing him to do so here could be a slippery slope that frees the executive to fire other agency heads, or lower-level civil servants.",
      "\"You\u2019re asking us to destroy the structure of government,\" Justice Sonia\u00a0Sotomayor told Sauer shortly after oral arguments kicked off. \"Where else have we so fundamentally altered the structure of government?\"",
      "\"You\u2019re asking us to overturn a case that has been around for nearly 100 years,\" she said, adding: \"I don't see how your logic can be limited,\" if Humphey's is overturned.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan echoed the same concerns. \"Once you're down this road, it's a little bit hard to see how you stop,\" she said.",
      "The case, Trump v. Slaughter, centers on Trump's firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, without cause earlier this year.",
      "Slaughter sued immediately to challenge her removal, arguing that it violated protections the Supreme Court enshrined in Humphrey's Executor.",
      "The 1935 precedent, and questions of separation of powers, drove the bulk of arguments Monday.",
      "The case also comes as the high court gears up to hear a case next month centered on Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The arguments in Monday's case will be closely watched and are expected to inform how the court might consider that case in January.",

      "Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas are seen in the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)",
      "Slaughter had sued in March over her removal, arguing that it violates Humphey's Executor, and a 1914 law passed by Congress, which shields FTC members from being removed by a president except in circumstances of \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "A federal judge had sided with Slaughter's lawyers in July, agreeing that her firing unlawfully exceeded Trump's executive authorites and ordered her reinstated. The Supreme Court in September stayed that decision temporarily, allowing Trump's firing to remain in effect pending their review.",
      "The Supreme Court's willingness to review the case is a sign that justices might be ready to do away completely with Humphrey's protections, which have already been weakened significantly over the last 20 years.",
      "Allowing Humphey's to be watered down further, or overturned completely, could allow sitting presidents to wield more authority in ordering the at-will firing of members of other federal regulatory agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others, and replacing them with persons of their choosing.",

      "They asked both parties to come prepared to address two key questions in oral arguments: First, whether the removal protections for FTC members \"violates the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey\u2019s Executor, should be overruled,\" and whether a federal court may prevent a person\u2019s removal from public office, \"either through relief at equity or at law.\"",
      "U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in a filing that the FTC authorities of today vastly exceed the authorities granted to the commission in 1935.",

    "story": [
      "House Republicans revealed what they are hoping will be included as the GOP works on a new comprehensive healthcare package.",
      "House Republicans are expected to reveal a roadmap sometime this month that they say will lower sky-high healthcare costs.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., have both said they are speaking to various GOP factions to build consensus on what that plan should look like.",
      "In the meantime, Fox News Digital spoke with several GOP lawmakers about what they believe should be in such a package and found several commonalities on what they expect.",
      "\"Health savings accounts (HSAs) need to be expanded to as many individual healthcare recipients or premium payers in our country. Like right now, it's the people that can access a health savings account, usually high-deductible, catastrophic coverage, those types of plans,\" said House GOP Conference Vice Chair Blake Moore, R-Utah. \"They're really well-used, but they need to be extended so basically all Americans on some type of health insurance policy can use health savings accounts.\"",

      "HSAs are accounts that allow people to set aside money pre-tax to pay for certain health expenses, but they are currently only available to people with high-deductible health insurance plans.",
      "Expanding HSA use proved a common theme among House Republicans who spoke with Fox News Digital about what they want to see in their party\u2019s health plan.",
      "Another topic that came up frequently was reforming the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) system, an issue that\u2019s gotten bipartisan support in the past.",
      "PBMs are third parties that act as intermediaries between pharmaceutical companies and those responsible for insurance coverage, often responsible for administrative tasks and negotiating drug prices.",
      "PBMs have also been the subject of bipartisan ire in Congress, with both Republicans and Democrats accusing them of being part of a broken system to inflate health costs.",

Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said. \"That is one of the quickest and the easiest ways to bring prescription drug prices down, by reeling them in.\"",

      "While few said they had any appetite for actually repealing and replacing the Obamacare system, most said they wanted Americans to have more options than just the federal program when choosing their own healthcare.",
      "\"We see that Obamacare has now been around for almost 14 years, and it's more expensive, and we have less choices than ever before. So Obamacare is not working, and I think that's what we need to focus on,\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. \"There's plans already being put in place by the administration, by groups in the Republican Party, that want to focus on making sure healthcare is affordable, and it's available and that people can make choices rather than being told who which doctor they have to go to.\"",

      "Democrats have warned that healthcare costs are set to spike for millions of Americans if the subsidies are not extended. But House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said costs are poised to rise either way if Congress does not act soon.",
      "\"All Americans are getting a health insurance premium increase this coming year of 20 to 30%. Even if we did what they wanted us to do \u2014 and I'm not saying that we won't, because the White House might have a plan to continue it, the Senate might have a plan. Mike Johnson might do something, but even if we do that, you realize that it's only gonna cover about 4% of that 20 to 30% increase. It's not solving the problem,\" Emmer said.",
      "Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital he wanted to see a healthcare package that focuses on doctors in rural areas, as well as reforms for hospital care.",
      "\"I've got to make sure that what we do is right for that independent practicing physician, that small-town pharmacist. And so we have to make sure we're taking care of rural America with what we do, as well as the hospitals that we would all go to if we had, you know, cancer treatment or something like that,\" he said.",

      "But whatever lawmakers come up with will likely have to get 60 votes to advance in the Senate, meaning some support from the left will be needed.",
      "\"There's a lot of good bipartisan healthcare policy legislation that can pass imminently and very soon, unless Democrats play the game of, \u2018Oh, I don't want it to look like the Republicans are being productive on healthcare, so we're gonna stymie this, even though I agree with the policy,\u2019\" Moore said.",

Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",

    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",
      "Short regular check-ins work better than one long conversation. Keep the tone open and supportive.",

      "Elite universities like Harvard, Princeton and Columbia spend fortunes on research, talent and digital infrastructure. Even then, they've become easy targets for attackers who see massive databases filled with personal information and donation records as a goldmine. Over the past few months, breaches across Ivy League campuses have exposed the same problem. These institutions handle huge amounts of sensitive data, but their internal defenses often don't match the scale of what they store. That pattern brings us to Harvard's newest incident, which exposed a database of alumni, donors, some students and faculty to hackers.",

      "A phone phishing attack unlocks Harvard's data",
      "Harvard confirmed that a database tied to alumni, donors, faculty and some students was accessed by an unauthorized party. This happened after a phone phishing attack tricked someone into giving the attacker a way into the system.",
      "\"On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Harvard University discovered that information systems used by Alumni Affairs and Development were accessed by an unauthorized party as a result of a phone-based phishing attack,\" the university said in a notification posted on its website. \"The University acted immediately to remove the attacker's access to our systems and prevent further unauthorized access.\"",
      "The exposed data includes personal contact details, donation histories and other records tied to the university's fundraising and alumni operations. For Harvard, a school that routinely raises more than a billion dollars a year, this database is one of its most valuable assets, which makes the breach even more serious.",
      "This is also the second time Harvard has had to investigate a breach in recent months. In October, it looked into reports that its data was caught up in a broader hacking campaign targeting Oracle customers. That earlier warning already showed that the school sits in a high-risk category. This latest breach only confirms it.",

      "Ivy League schools are in a growing crisis",
      "Harvard isn't alone here. Ivy League campuses have seen a wave of incidents that line up almost back-to-back. Princeton reported on Nov. 15 that one of its databases tied to alumni, donors, students and community members was compromised.",
      "The University of Pennsylvania said on Oct. 31 that information systems connected to its development and alumni activities were accessed without permission. Columbia has been dealing with an even larger fallout. A breach in June exposed the personal data of roughly 870,000 people, including students and applicants.",
      "These attacks show how universities have become predictable targets. They store identities, addresses, financial records and donor information. They also run sprawling IT systems where a single mistake, a weak password or a convincing phone call can create an entry point.",
      "Hackers know this, and they strike repeatedly. The recent cluster of Ivy League breaches suggests that attackers are mapping these environments, looking for shared weaknesses that appear again and again.",

      "You can't stop a university or company from being breached, but you can make sure that your own information is harder to exploit. These steps help you reduce the fallout when your data ends up in the wrong hands.",
      "Using 2FA gives your accounts an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password in a breach, they still need the one-time code from your phone or authentication app. It blocks most casual attempts and forces attackers to work much harder.",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every site you use. This keeps one compromised password from unlocking everything else. It also removes the stress of remembering dozens of logins, so you don't cut corners.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "You can request takedowns from data broker sites, delete old accounts and trim what you share publicly. When your information isn't scattered across the internet, attackers have a much harder time piecing together your identity.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Many attackers rely on old flaws in operating systems, browsers and apps. Regular updates patch these holes and shut down the most common attack paths. If you're someone who delays updates, turning on automatic updates helps.",
      "Use alias email addresses for banking, education, shopping and newsletters. If one of them gets exposed, it won't automatically give attackers a map of your entire digital life. It makes targeted scams much harder to pull off, and also stops attackers from stealing your identity. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "You might also want to consider an identity theft protection service to be on the safe side. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Harvard's latest breach adds to a growing list of cyberattacks that show how vulnerable top universities have become. Even the most well-funded institutions aren't keeping pace with modern threats. When a simple phone phishing call can open the door to sensitive data tied to donors, alumni and students, it's clear that these campuses need stronger defenses and more proactive monitoring. Until that happens, you can expect more headlines like this and more investigations after the damage is already done.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Air taxis keep gaining momentum, yet one challenge keeps resurfacing: many cities have few places for them to land. AutoFlight believes it has an answer. The company introduced a zero-carbon water vertiport that moves across rivers, lakes or coastal zones. This solar-powered platform works as a mobile hub for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and aims to remove one of the biggest barriers to growth.",

      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "AutoFlight\u2019s solar-powered water vertiport shows how air taxis could finally gain flexible landing spots. (AutoFlight)",
      "The landing bottleneck that held air taxis back",
      "eVTOL air taxis promise quick trips that jump over traffic and turn long drives into short flights. That idea first appeared in the 1940s and '50s, when helicopter passenger services launched in the U.S. and Britain. Those early attempts faded because they could land in only a handful of places. Rooftops and scattered piers created new congestion points. Without enough landing pads, the entire system stalled.",
      "AutoFlight's new floating vertiport flips the model. Instead of forcing cities to build fixed sites that take years to complete, the vertiport travels to the aircraft.",
      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "The mobile platform supports fast charging and takeoffs for several eVTOL aircraft in real-world conditions. (AutoFlight)",
      "Inside the zero-carbon water vertiport",
      "The vertiport sits on a self-propelled barge with a deck lined with solar panels. It uses clean energy to charge eVTOLs without relying on grid power. A small cabin serves as a departure lounge and technical room. Operators can reposition the platform wherever demand rises, which gives cities far more flexibility.",
      "It works with several AutoFlight aircraft. That includes the six-seat Prosperity passenger craft and the White Shark and CarryAll vehicles used for cargo and industrial tasks. All can land, recharge and take off from the same floating hub.",
      "Because the platform runs on solar power and needs no major construction, it can be deployed much faster than any land-based site.",
      "First public demo on the water",
      "AutoFlight showed the full system on Nov. 22 at Dianshan Lake near Shanghai. A 2-ton-class eVTOL took off from the floating vertiport during a public test. The company also flew three aircraft in formation and completed live airdrop missions with supplies and life rafts. The event highlighted how the system supports emergency work and low-altitude logistics.",
      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "The system highlights how floating hubs may expand air mobility across commuting, emergency work and tourism.\u00a0 (AutoFlight)",
      "Five sectors this system could reshape",
      "This new platform supports a wide range of real-world uses that reach far beyond simple city travel.",
      "Offshore wind sites and oil rigs often wait hours for parts or personnel. AutoFlight says the system could improve transport efficiency more than tenfold.",
      "Teams can pair wide-area searches with fast aerial response. This cuts reaction time by over half and boosts survival odds.",
      "Cities along rivers and bays could build quick air routes without touching roads.",
      "Tour operators could add a \"flight plus water\" experience to premium trips.",
      "Multiple floating hubs can link into a network during peak travel or disaster relief missions.",
      "How AutoFlight pushes clean air mobility",
      "Sustainable aviation keeps gaining importance. AutoFlight partnered with CATL to integrate high-safety batteries into both its aircraft and vertiports. The system uses clean energy and low-impact infrastructure. It taps underused water surfaces and avoids major construction. Cities can deploy these pads quickly, which helps air mobility grow sooner.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air taxis may feel far off, yet this solution tackles a real problem. Landing and charging sites remain the missing link. Floating vertiports open the door to fast routes between airports and city centers. They also set the stage for quick regional hops that cut travel times and reduce stress. Tourism operators may even use them to launch new water-to-air experiences.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "What is reward hacking in AI?",
      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful.

      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",

      "The FBI says scammers target Gmail, Outlook and nearly every other inbox this time of year as they push fake messages that trick you into giving up money or sensitive information.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Scammers use realistic emails during the holiday rush, so even normal inbox alerts can hide dangerous threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the FBI is raising the alarm",
      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center notes that Americans lose more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams during the holiday cycle and the months that follow. Credit card fraud pushed losses higher by another $199 million. Complaints usually surge in the early months of the year, which the IC3 ties to holiday activity that happens in November and December.",
      "The agency highlights four major schemes that spike during the season. They include non-delivery scams, where you pay for items that never arrive; non-payment scams, where sellers get nothing after shipping items; auction fraud, where the product is not what the listing claimed; and gift card fraud, where criminals push victims to pay with prepaid cards.",

      "The agency is also tracking a sharp rise in account takeover attacks. Since January 2025, IC3 has received more than 5,100 complaints tied to these scams with reported losses of over $262 million.",
      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results. Once a victim enters their information, scammers log in, lock out the real owner and move money. Many transfers go through cryptocurrency wallets to hide the trail.",
      "Criminals design phishing messages to look urgent, pushing people to act fast and give up sensitive information. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from holiday email scams",
      "You can lower your risk with a few simple habits.",
      "Avoid opening links or files in emails, websites or social media posts you did not expect. Also, use strong antivirus software to catch malware if you accidentally click on something unsafe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If a message asks you to update your password or account information, find the company's phone number yourself and call to verify it.",
      "Scammers create a sense of urgency. Slow down and confirm what you are being told.",
      "Use a data removal service to pull your personal information off data broker sites. These services scan dozens of brokers that publish your phone number, home address, email and even shopping habits. When less of your data is exposed, scammers have fewer details to use when crafting convincing phishing emails or impersonating trusted companies. This makes it harder for criminals to target you with personalized attacks during the holiday shopping rush.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), avoid reusing passwords and update your passwords as soon as you hear about a new scam or data leak that could affect you. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Create alias email addresses for shopping and sign-ups. These aliases forward messages to your primary inbox and help reduce spam. They also limit how much of your real information scammers can access if a retailer or website faces a breach.",
      "The FBI says victims should contact their financial institutions as soon as they notice fraud. Request a recall or reversal and ask for a hold harmless letter or letter of indemnity. Then reset every credential connected to the exposed password, including any account that uses the same login.",

      "Bradley J. Nelson, an author of the paper in Science and a professor of robotics at ETH Zurich, said the team has barely begun to understand what this technology will make possible. He expects surgeons will find many new uses once they see how precise the tool becomes inside the body.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The idea of a grain-sized robot navigating the bloodstream sounds bold, yet the science behind it is moving forward fast. Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Most major platforms have dealt with large-scale data leaks tied to weak or unprotected APIs. You've seen this play out with Facebook, X and even Dell.",
      "The pattern is always the same. A feature meant to make life easier becomes a gateway for bulk data collection.",
      "WhatsApp is now part of that list after researchers managed to scrape 3.5 billion phone numbers by exploiting a simple gap in the app's contact-discovery system.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",

      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "WhatsApp might have fixed the issue, but the bigger problem is still out there. Any platform that exposes an API without proper rate limits is leaving a window open for someone with the right tools and enough time. This scrape shows you how quickly that window can turn into a firehose of personal data. Until API security becomes a priority across the board, you'll keep seeing leaks like this repeat on bigger and bigger scales.",

Clips spread online within hours, and people everywhere claimed the same thing: it looked too human to be a machine.",
      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",
      "The demonstration showed Iron was a real machine with complex systems beneath its flexible skin.",

      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",

      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear. They have not shared when consumers will be able to buy a version suited for daily household tasks. Engineers still need to address safety, privacy and reliability standards before a humanoid can operate inside private homes.",
      "Even so, this moment signals a clear shift: robots that move and react in a lifelike way are no longer far-off ideas. They are stepping into public spaces where people will see them operate up close. This shift could reshape how we all view service work and personal assistance in the years ahead.",

Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself.

It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Attackers often tailor phishing messages using information they find about you. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for them to craft emails that feel convincing. You can use personal data removal services to clean up exposed details and old database leaks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Do not rely on the display name. Always check the full email address. Attackers often tweak domain names by a single letter or symbol. If something feels off, open the site manually instead of clicking any link inside the email.",
      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",

      "Phishing attacks are changing fast, and tricks like invisible characters show how creative attackers are getting. It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

Cybercriminals will often turn to online load boards \u2013 an online marketplace in which companies and truck drivers can share details regarding upcoming shipments \u2013 to determine which vehicles they want to target.",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson says political correctness halted fraud investigations as more than $1B in taxpayer funds vanished with some possibly reaching al-Shabaab.",
      "A series of sprawling fraud schemes involving hundreds of millions of dollars stolen from Minnesota taxpayers \u2014 from COVID-relief programs to housing and autism services \u2014 have placed the state\u2019s Somali community under a renewed, intense spotlight, raising uncomfortable questions about whether some who found refuge here are robbing their new neighbors blind.",
      "These swirling fraud cases \u2014 and claims that some ill-gotten gains were diverted to the Somali terrorist organization Al-Shabaab \u2014 have now prompted a House investigation, a Treasury Department probe and mounting political pressure on state leaders, including Democrat Gov. Tim Walz, over why Minnesota failed to safeguard taxpayer money.",
      "The fraud revelations, combined with a string of violent crimes and revived terror concerns involving Somali-linked defendants, have shaken public confidence and raised urgent questions about why Minnesota failed to stop the schemes sooner. The developments have also deepened public unease and revived long-standing questions about assimilation, oversight and public safety in Minnesota.",

Lawmakers say the state\u2019s oversight failures and political sensitivity around Somali-run nonprofits helped fuel the $1 billion welfare fraud scandal now under federal investigation. (Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images; Michael Dorgan/Fox News Digital)",
      "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told Fox News Digital that the fraud scandal represents \"a catastrophic failure of oversight\" under Walz and characterized some of the culprits involved as a \"Somali criminal enterprise crew.\"",
      "\"People can focus on an ethnic group if they want, but the real issue is the lack of leadership and accountability in the state of Minnesota with Tim Walz and his administration. This wasn\u2019t about Somalis; this was about government incompetence and lack of accountability,\" Emmer said.",
      "\"We have been trying to sound the alarm on this fraud\u2026 for more than three years.\"",
      "The centerpiece scandal is the Feeding Our Future case, where approximately $300 million intended to feed low-income children during the pandemic was siphoned away in what federal prosecutors describe as the largest pandemic-relief fraud scheme charged in U.S. history. Some of the shell companies and meal sites were operated by Somali Minnesotans, prosecutors say, though the alleged ringleader \u2014 Aimee Bock \u2014 is a White American.",
      "That sprawling case has now grown to at least 78 defendants, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota.",

      "Prosecutors say criminals also bilked millions of dollars from Minnesota\u2019s Housing Stabilization Services program \u2014 which pays for help finding and keeping housing \u2014 as well as the state\u2019s autism-services program by billing for appointments, therapy and casework that never took place.",
      "Former Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson described the scams as \"schemes stacked upon schemes\" that drained tens of millions of dollars from Medicaid. At least some of those defendants also have ties to the Somali community.",
      "\"It feels never-ending,\" Thompson said in September, when announcing that eight people had been charged with defrauding the housing stabilization services program of around $8.4 million in total. \"I have spent my career as a fraud prosecutor and the depth of the fraud in Minnesota takes my breath away.\u00a0The fraud must be stopped.\"",
      "Thompson said the eight were part of the \"first wave\" of prosecutions in the case. The fraudsters, in many instances, spent the cash on luxury cars, lavish lifestyles and purchasing property at home and in places like Kenya.",

      "State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, the lead Republican on the state Senate's Human Services Committee, told Fox News Digital he believes the Feeding Our Future scandal grew to historic levels because state leaders were afraid to investigate Somali-run nonprofits and unwilling to confront obvious fraud.",
      "\"Concerns of political correctness halted the Walz administration from doing the investigations they needed to protect Minnesota\u2019s tax dollars,\" Rasmusson said.",
      "He said state DHS dysfunction \"from the time that Gov. Walz took office\" created an environment where criminals were able to exploit human-services programs for years.",
      "\"The administration has been asleep at the wheel,\" he said.",
      "A widely circulated DHS whistleblower account alleged that staff who raised internal fraud concerns were ignored, reassigned or sidelined \u2014 which tracks with Rasmusson\u2019s account.",
      "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer criticized Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for his handling of the widespread fraud. (Getty Images)",
      "Bock, the founder and executive director of Feeding Our Future, and Salim Said, a local restaurant owner, were found guilty of their roles in the scheme, with prosecutors stating that they splashed their cash on luxury homes and cars, as well as their lavish lifestyles.",
      "They claimed to have served 91 million meals, for which they fraudulently received nearly $250 million in federal funds, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota. It's unclear how many Somalis were involved in the scheme, as prosecutors don't release the nationalities of defendants.",
      "One witness reportedly claimed that Said disclosed a gang affiliation and threatened to kill that person if they reported the fraud to authorities, Thompson said.",
      "Additionally, five people were also charged with offering a cash bribe to a juror and preparing written arguments for the juror. One argument read, \"We are immigrants: they don\u2019t respect or care about us.\"",
      "In 2021, when the Minnesota Department of Education grew suspicious and tried to stop the flow of funds, Feeding Our Future sued, alleging racial discrimination. A judge ordered the state to restart reimbursements \u2014 a ruling prosecutors said enabled the scheme to escalate.",
      "Prosecutors say Aimee Bock, founder of Feeding Our Future, and Salim Said helped orchestrate one of the largest pandemic-relief fraud schemes in U.S. history. Both were found guilty of diverting federal child-nutrition funds into luxury homes, vehicles and other personal spending, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. (Sherburne County Sheriff\u2019s Office)",
      "The lawsuit drew political support from Somali-American State Sen. Omar Fateh, who appeared at a community celebration of the ruling and later acknowledged receiving \u2014 and returning \u2014 campaign donations from individuals indicted in the case.",
      "While investigating the scandal, federal agents discovered that one scammer, Asha Farhan Hassan, had pocketed about $465,000 but was also operating a much larger scheme: defrauding the state\u2019s autism-treatment program of roughly $14 million. Hassan billed Medicaid for fake therapy sessions, used untrained staff and paid parents $300 to $1,500 a month to keep their kids in the program. She sent hundreds of thousands of dollars abroad, including to purchase real estate in Kenya, prosecutors said.",
      "The scale of program growth stunned federal officials. The Housing Stabilization Services program was projected to cost $2.6 million annually but paid out more than $100 million last year. The autism program\u2019s budget jumped from $3 million in 2018 to nearly $400 million in 2023, according to Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "The unraveling fraud schemes intensified scrutiny of Walz\u2019s administration, with critics arguing basic safeguards were ignored even as theft ballooned.",
      "A recent City Journal article claimed some stolen welfare money has flowed to Al-Shabaab in Somalia through informal \"hawala\" networks. That report has intensified scrutiny and stirred old fears, given that about 20 young Somali-Americans left Minnesota in the late 2000s to join the terrorist group, with one, Shirwa Ahmed, becoming the first known American Islamist suicide bomber when he detonated a car bomb in Somalia in October 2008.",
      "Rasmusson said he was concerned about money ending up with terrorists.",
      "\"Because there\u2019s more than a billion dollars that\u2019s been stolen and a significant portion of those dollars have been directed overseas, there are concerns this money could be either directly or indirectly funding terrorist organizations like al-Shabaab,\" Rasmusson told Fox News Digital.",

      "Former Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, who testified before Congress about Somali-American radicalization, said Minnesota ignored early warning signs once before.",
      "\"We really got a wake-up call in 2010-11,\" Stanek said. \"Young people were going back to Somalia to participate in terrorist training camps and terrorist actions when they had no clear ties back to their culture. They were born here in the U.S. but felt a need or were radicalized to go back.\"",
      "\"Minnesotans had no idea what was even going on until the FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force stepped in.\"",

      "Last year, Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, 23, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to ISIS after twice trying to travel to Somalia.",
      "For many Minnesotans, the fraud cases are only the latest chapter in a longer pattern of violence and instability tied to small pockets of the Somali community. Public unease has also grown recently in response to a string of recent violent crimes tied to the community in the Twin Cities.",

      "During a two-week stretch over the summer, a 15-year-old was killed in a mall shooting, while two high-school graduation ceremonies left a 49-year-old father with a head wound and a 19-year-old man injured. All three incidents involved members of the Somali-American community, according\u00a0to reports, while Emmer said the incidents were gang-related.",

      "In May, Michael Lual Nhial, who had a history of erratic and aggressive behavior, was charged with killing David Chant, a 59-year-old man who used walking sticks to get around and was found beaten to death at a park in Burnsville, a city 15 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.",
      "Stanek said Somali-related violence began surfacing between 2005 and 2010, initially involving first-generation immigrants but later drawing in U.S.-born youth, with most shootings traced back to a small network of repeat offenders \u2014 young men cycling through probation and short jail terms.",
      "Groups such as the Somali Outlaws and 10th Street Gang were never tightly organized criminal syndicates but loose crews of young men whose crimes stemmed more from personal rivalries than organized criminal enterprises, he said.",

      "But community leaders are pushing back, saying Minnesota\u2019s Somali population is overwhelmingly law-abiding and hardworking \u2014 and that a handful of offenders are being used to smear an entire community. They say the above incidents do not define them and that most Somali immigrants in the state are hardworking and deeply patriotic toward the United States.",

Hussein did not defend the crimes but placed their actions in the broader context of American immigrant history \u2014 drawing parallels to Irish and Italian communities once linked to organized crime.",
      "\"We have a history in this nation of identifying crime and associating it with communities \u2014 whether it\u2019s the Italian mafia or Irish gangs,\" Hussein said. \"Crime is an individual act. It\u2019s an act of betrayal of our trust. When someone steals money from food at a school, they\u2019re not stealing from anybody else \u2014 they\u2019re stealing from their own community, from children who need it.

      "European Christmas markets are opening this year under tightened security and rising operational costs, as officials across Germany, France and other parts of Europe respond to what authorities describe as elevated threats to public safety.",
      "In Germany, spending on security for public events \u2014 including Christmas markets \u2014 has increased by about 44% over the past three years, according to a new survey by the Federal Association of City and Town Marketing. Berlin\u2019s main market launched this season behind concrete barriers, enhanced video surveillance, and an expanded private security presence. Several smaller municipalities warn that the added requirements may force them to scale back or cancel markets next year.",
      "\"The requirements have become increasingly stringent,\" David Russ, head of production at Berlin\u2019s Gendarmenmarkt, told Reuters. The heightened measures, he said, allow visitors to feel secure: \"I can just let go of everything here \u2014 I feel safe.\"",

      "While many towns receive some public funding to operate holiday markets, smaller municipalities and private organizers often shoulder most of the expense. Local officials have begun calling on Germany\u2019s 16 federal states to take on a larger share of the financial burden, arguing that counter-terrorism measures extend beyond the responsibility of local event planners.",
      "The upgrades follow last December\u2019s SUV attack at the Magdeburg Christmas market, which killed six people and injured more than 300. Since then, many German cities have reinforced infrastructure, revised crowd-control plans, and increased surveillance at large seasonal gatherings.",

      "France has moved in a similar direction. Authorities canceled the annual New Year\u2019s Eve concert on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es after police raised concerns about crowd management and what the Interior Ministry described as a \"very high\" terror threat level. The ministry has classified Christmas markets and other winter festivities as \"high-risk\" events, prompting cities to deploy additional officers, introduce new screening points and impose access restrictions where needed.",
      "\"The real question is why European governments are tolerating a situation where they must deploy extraordinary security just so people can safely celebrate a tradition that has been central to European life for centuries,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society told Fox News Digital. \"They\u2019re responding to the threat, but they\u2019re not pushing back against the radical extremists causing it. Why are Europeans forced to navigate layers of security instead of authorities making life difficult for the people who are spreading hatred and posing the threat?\"",
      "Visitors walk through the Magdeburg Christmas market after the opening in Magdeburg, Germany, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025.\u00a0 (Matthias Bein/dpa via AP)",
      "\"Europe needs an aggressive strategy that targets the radicals \u2014 imprisoning them, deporting them if they\u2019re not citizens \u2014 because you can\u2019t secure your way out of this forever,\" Mendoza continued. \"Every year the security will increase unless the root causes are addressed. Europeans are increasingly fed up with what\u2019s happening to their societies, and if current leaders won\u2019t deliver transformative change, voters will eventually choose leaders who will.\"",
      "Other European countries are also reinforcing their holiday operations. According to The Sun, the iconic Christmas market in Salzburg, Austria \u2014 which draws roughly 1.5 million visitors each year \u2014 is now monitored by round-the-clock private security and a network of 33 dedicated cameras. Elsewhere in Austria, including Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s home region of Styria, some markets have been canceled entirely because organizers say they cannot afford the mandated security measures.",

      "In Prague, large concrete blocks have been placed along popular embankments and around key foot-traffic areas, while police have increased patrols to monitor potential targets. In Budapest, additional plain-clothes officers are circulating through crowds to identify suspicious behavior and improve response speed.",
      "Ben Cohen, a senior analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that authorities are treating the holiday season with heightened seriousness. \"The threat level is certainly the same as last year. Arguably, it's more acute now, which is why the authorities in Germany and France are increasing security measures at Christmas markets and fairs this year. Over the last year, both countries have cracked down on Islamist activity, so they will be especially on their guard at this time of year.\"",
      "\"More broadly,\" he added, \"both Christian and Jewish festivals are seen as soft targets by jihadists, as evidenced by the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur in October. Christmas and Easter carry the same risks and so extra vigilance and a strong but discreet armed police presence is definitely warranted.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday weighs whether to drive the final nail into the coffin of the long-standing concept of independent federal agencies that operate at arm\u2019s length from the president.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday appeared poised to side with President Donald Trump and allow him to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, a provocative move aimed at upending the long-standing concept of independent federal agencies.",
      "In a significant case on the structure of the federal government, the conservative-majority court heard oral arguments on whether Trump had the authority to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter notwithstanding a law enacted by Congress to insulate the agency from political pressures.",
      "The 1914 law that set up the FTC says members can be removed only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has already signaled, with strong opposition from the three liberal justices, that Trump is likely to win the case by allowing Slaughter, a Democrat, to be removed from office while the litigation continues.",
      "A ruling in Trump's favor would have broad repercussions, not just for the FTC but also for a host of other federal agencies set up by Congress with similar removal restrictions, by giving presidents greater authority over them.",
      "In addition to permitting Trump to fire Slaughter, the Supreme Court also allowed firings at some of the other affected agencies, further signaling that the majority favors Trump\u2019s position.",
      "There was little sign during Monday's oral argument that the conservative majority would change its course, although some justices suggested some limitations on the president's removal powers, especially as it relates to the Federal Reserve, which is the subject of separate litigation. The liberal justices remained united against the government's arguments.",
      "In ruling for Trump, the court could overturn a 1935 Supreme Court ruling called Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, which upheld those restrictions on the president\u2019s power to fire FTC members.",
      "In one exchange with Slaughter's lawyer, Amit Agarwal, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch said the Humphrey's ruling was \"poorly reasoned\" and suggested he would be a vote to overturn it.",
      "\"There's no such thing in our constitutional order as a fourth branch of government that's quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" he said, referring to the idea that independent agencies do not fit within any of the three branches of government defined in the Constitution: the executive, Congress and the courts.",
      "Likewise, fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said the Humphrey's ruling is a \"dried husk\" that stands for little because the FTC has changed so much in the intervening 90 years.",
      "He appeared to agree with the Trump administration's view that the agency now exercises more executive powers than it used to, meaning the president, as head of the executive branch, should have more authority over it.",
      "The Supreme Court in 1935 was \"addressing an agency that had very little, if any, executive power, and that may be why they were able to attract such a broad support on the court at the time,\" Roberts said.",
      "Another member of the conservative majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, echoed an argument made by opponents of independent agencies, saying they are not accountable to the people.",
      "\"They're not elected as Congress and the president are and are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries,\" he said.",
      "The justices went back and forth with Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who represented the government, about what limits the justices might impose on a potential ruling in Trump's favor.",
      "In addition to the Federal Reserve, they could exempt certain government bodies that have a mostly adjudicative role from a ruling for the administration, such as the tax courts and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. (Although both are called courts, they are not part of the separate judicial branch.)",
      "\"It seems to me that there are very hard questions ... about what the limits of your logic would be,\" conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Sauer.",
      "The liberal justices all mounted a defense of the long-standing protections for independent agency members.",
      "\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.",
      "Trump fired Slaughter and the commission\u2019s other Democratic appointee in March. The FTC, which is responsible for consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, currently has just two of five commissioners, both Republican-appointed.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has sought to dramatically remake the federal government by downsizing agencies whose missions he does not favor, withholding Congress-approved spending he opposes and firing thousands of career federal employees.",
      "The MAGA movement and allied business interests have long targeted federal workers and the agencies where they work as a shadowy, unaccountable deep state.",
      "Government bodies set up by Congress to be independent of the president have been a particular focus of the Trump administration. Many of those agencies wield considerable regulatory power and have long been loathed by business interests.",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business group in the nation, is among the organizations that filed a brief backing the administration over Slaughter\u2019s firing.",
      "Trump\u2019s legal team has fully embraced a conservative legal argument called the \u201cunitary executive theory,\u201d which asserts that the president has the exclusive authority under Article 2 of the Constitution to exert executive power, including making regulatory decisions.",
      "Trump has fired, without cause, members not just of the FTC, but also many other agencies that have power over vital health, safety, labor and environmental issues, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Surface Transportation Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.",
      "The administration has also gone further afield, asserting the power to fire officials in bodies set up by Congress that are not under the executive branch, including the Library of Congress.",
      "Just last week, the administration added Trump\u2019s name to the sign on the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, a private corporation created by Congress. Trump removed various board members upon taking office, with an appeals court allowing him to do so despite ongoing litigation.",
      "The FTC firing dispute is one of a flurry of cases in which the Supreme Court has faced considerable criticism over how it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump via emergency orders without hearing oral arguments or issuing detailed rulings.",
      "One significant exception in the firings context is Trump\u2019s effort to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. In a May order, the court suggested that the Federal Reserve is different from other agencies because it is \u201cuniquely structured.\u201d",
      "The justices will hear arguments in Cook\u2019s case in January."

      "Habba was sworn in on March 28, but interim appointments are capped at 120 days. Trump nominated her to be the permanent U.S. attorney on June 30, but the \u201cSenate did not act\u201d on her nomination, U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann noted.",
      "On July 22, judges of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey invoked their statutory power to appoint a new U.S. attorney \u2014 Habba\u2019s deputy.",
      "The Justice Department then \u201cconceived a multi-step maneuver\u201d to keep Habba on the job, the judge said, with Bondi firing Habba\u2019s successor and appointing Habba as \u201cSpecial Attorney to the Attorney General\u201d and then to the opened deputy spot \u2014 which allowed her to become acting U.S. attorney.",
      "The judge found the machinations weren't legal and were way of sidestepping the Senate confirmation process, and that Habba \"must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases.\u201d",
      "A panel of 3rd Circuit judges agreed in a ruling last week that Habba should be disqualified, and that if allowed to stand, the way she was appointed would allow DOJ to fill such posts \"indefinitely.\"",
      "\"This should raise a red flag,\u201d the ruling said.",
      "In her statement Monday, Habba said judges have become \"weapons of the politicized left.\"",
      "Habba's appointment had been challenged by some criminal defendants who argued she did not have the authority to oversee their cases. While Brann paused his ruling from taking effect until Habba's appeal was decided, the dispute caused headaches throughout the federal courts in the state, with some judges delaying trials for fear Habba's involvement could lead to cases being overturned.",
      "Habba is not the only U.S. attorney whose appointment has been challenged.",
      "A federal judge last month dismissed criminal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after having found that Lindsey Halligan, another former Trump lawyer who was prosecuting the cases, had been unlawfully appointed as acting U.S. attorney for Eastern District of Virginia.",

    "story": [
      "More parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, a study published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found. It\u2019s a trend that experts worry could have deadly consequences.",
      "Babies are born with very low levels of vitamin K, a nutrient the body needs for blood to clot, leaving them at risk for severe bleeding early in life. In the early 1960s, hospitals in the United States began giving newborns shots of the vitamin within the first six hours of birth to prevent bleeding, including bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or brain.",
      "Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and the leader of the study, said he and his co-authors noticed a rise in parents turning down the shot in their own practices, prompting the research.",
      "Still, Scott said, he wasn\u2019t fully expecting the results.",
      "\u201cThe increase is not surprising, but the degree to which it did increase did catch me off guard,\u201d he said.",
      "The study analyzed electronic medical record data from Epic Systems\u2019 Cosmos database, which included whether an infant received a vitamin K shot. The study included more than 5 million babies born in 403 hospitals in all 50 states, from 2017 through 2024. The researchers found that about 4% of babies \u2014 about 200,000 \u2014 born in this time frame didn\u2019t get vitamin K shots. The percentage rose from less than 3% in 2017 to more than 5% in 2024. The trend was highest among non-Hispanic white babies.",
      "The rate really started increasing from 2019 to 2020, and accelerated during and after the Covid pandemic, the study found.",
      "Scott said there haven\u2019t been any large policy changes regarding vitamin K shots from hospitals, nor changes in recommendations from medical organizations. That means the rise in babies not getting vitamin K shots is almost certainly due to parental refusal, he said.",
      "Reports of a trend go back before 2017. A 2016 study in the journal Hospital Pediatrics looked at why parents refuse the shot.",
      "Widespread misinformation on social media and rising vaccine skepticism are likely contributing to an uptick in the number of parents refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns, said Dr. Tiffany McKee-Garrett, an associate professor of pediatrics at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "\u201cParents are equating vitamin K injections to vaccines,\u201d McKee-Garrett said, adding that a vitamin K shot is not a vaccine, but a supplement derived from a plant.",
      "Dr. Ivan Hand, director of neonatology at NYC Health + Hospitals Kings County in Brooklyn, has also noticed the trend in his practice.",
      "\u201cI think this comes from general mistrust in authority that started probably in the later part of the 2010s,\u201d said Hand, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research.",
      "In 2022, Hand co-authored an American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on parents refusing vitamin K shots for newborns.",
      "Newborns who don\u2019t get a vitamin K shot are more than 80 times more likely to have bleeding from vitamin K deficiency than those who get the shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bleeding can happen up to six months after birth.",
      "\u201cWe are creating a population of newborns who are at risk of bleeding,\u201d Scott said, adding that this could include anything from bruising, to losing blood when the umbilical cord is cut, to gastrointestinal bleeding. \u201cBleeding into the brain is what we really worry about, essentially a stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can ultimately cause death.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the drop in the number of infants getting the shot that doctors are seeing correlates to a rise in the number of cases of bleeding from vitamin K deficiency in infants.",
      "Hand said he has not seen an increase in his practice, but added that he only sees infants just after they are born. Scott said he believes further research will find an increase in bleeding events.",
      "\u201cWe know unequivocally that when infants do not receive vitamin K, they are at increased risk of bleeding,\u201d he said, adding that at CHOP, there has not only been an increase in vitamin K refusal, but also an increase in bleeding.",
      "In Houston, McKee-Garrett has heard reports of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, something that was extremely rare for decades after the U.S. began widely giving vitamin K shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a preventable disease, so we shouldn\u2019t be seeing it at all,\u201d Hand said.",
      "In some countries, babies are given oral doses of vitamin K supplements. However, these formulas can be inconsistent and each baby\u2019s digestive system absorbs different amounts of the nutrient, Hand said, adding that breast milk is also not a good enough source of vitamin K to prevent deficiency. Oral vitamin K supplements also need to be given multiple times, whereas the vitamin shots only need to be given once. Studies in Europe have also shown that while oral vitamin K supplementation may be effective in the first week of life, it may be much less effective at preventing late-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can occur up to 6 months of age.",
      "\u201cThat late-onset bleeding, the bleeding that occurs internally, has a 20% mortality rate,\u201d McKee-Garrett said. Some studies have found it to be as high as 50%.",
      "Because vitamin K shots have been widely given in the U.S. for more than 60 years, Hand said parents may not understand the risk of forgoing the prophylactic.",
      "\u201cThese treatments have been so effective that people don\u2019t understand the consequences. They have never seen babies with severe bleeding, so they think it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see it because we are treating these kids.\u201d"

When we met at 15, that\u2019s what we set out to do, and we\u2019re both just so grateful that we\u2019ve had the journey that we\u2019ve had.

Babies in your family \u2014 there\u2019s nothing that tops it. \u2026 Our goal was never to be the biggest stars in the world.

    "summary": "Paramount is launching a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros.",
    "story": [
      "Paramount is launching a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery after it lost to Netflix in a high-stakes bidding war, the company announced Monday, setting the stage for a corporate drama worthy of \u201cSuccession.\u201d",
      "Paramount said it would offer $30 per share for the media conglomerate, which owns the Warner Bros. film studio, the cable channel HBO, the streaming service HBO Max and a portfolio of cable brands.",
      "In a federal securities filing, Paramount said the hostile bid will be backed in part by funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates as well as Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law.",
      "The bid comes after Netflix agreed last week to buy a large part of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share. Netflix\u2019s takeover would not include the Warner-owned cable channels, which include CNN and TNT.",
      "The offer lays the groundwork for what could become a public and contentious battle for Warner Bros., a process that had already included appeals to Trump, who said he intends to play a role in any merger.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s board of directors has already approved its deal with Netflix, but Paramount\u2019s move to go directly to shareholders \u2014 a maneuver known in the business world as a hostile bid \u2014 will push what had been private negotiations into the public realm.",
      "Paramount\u2019s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is the latest head-spinning twist in a saga that has riveted Hollywood, where film and television executives are growing increasingly uneasy about studio consolidation, contracting content spending and the rise of generative artificial intelligence.",
      "In a news release, Paramount said its offer to Warner Bros. shareholders \u201cprovides a superior alternative to the Netflix transaction,\u201d warning that a deal with the streaming giant risks entangling the studio in a complex regulatory process.",
      "\u201cWBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\u201d Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOur public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment.",
      "Ellison acquired Paramount earlier this year in an $8 billion deal that housed the studio\u2019s assets under his company Skydance. He is the son of Larry Ellison, a billionaire technology magnate with close ties to Trump.",
      "Unlike Netflix\u2019s bid, Paramount\u2019s offer would be a all cash, backstopped by the Ellison family\u2019s fortune. The company also said it has a $54 billion funding commitment from Bank of America, Citi and private equity firm Apollo Global. The total value of the deal would be more than $108 billion.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really here to to finish what we started,\u201d Ellison told CNBC shortly after announcing the bid.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine the No. 1 streamer with the No. 3 streamer, that creates a company that has unprecedented market power, north of 400 million subscribers,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThe next largest competitor is Disney, with just under 200 million. That\u2019s bad for Hollywood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe we have the superior offer, we\u2019re taking that directly to shareholders and we think that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d Ellison said.",
      "Major corporate acquisitions are already complicated affairs, and when companies are willing to launch hostile bids and outbid each other, they can turn combative and litigious. But the competition for Warner Bros. Discovery has been further complicated by Trump\u2019s political involvement.",
      "While such acquisitions are always subject to government regulatory approval, it is exceedingly rare for a president to take a public role in a private transaction.",
      "On Sunday, Trump said Netflix buying Warner Bros. could be an antitrust \u201cproblem.\u201d He added that he will \u201cbe involved\u201d in the approval process for that deal.",
      "The president also said that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos had recently visited him in the Oval Office to discuss the deal, but that Trump made no promises.",
      "Asked about Trump on CNBC, Ellison said that he\u2019s \u201cincredibly grateful for the relations that I have with the president.\u201d He added that he believes Trump \u201cbelieves in competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had great conversations with the president about this,\u201d Ellison also said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to speak for him in any way, shape or form.\u201d",
      "In a Truth Social post published just minutes after Paramount announced its hostile bid, Trump blasted the company over Sunday\u2019s installment of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which featured an interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a firebrand conservative who has become a fierce critic of the president.",
      "\u201cMy real problem with the show, however, wasn\u2019t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cTHEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\u201d",
      "The president was referring to the $16 million Paramount paid to settle a lawsuit from Trump over an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Trump accused CBS of having deceptively edited the segment \u2014 a claim the network denied.",
      "CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s post.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery hung up a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign earlier this year and announced plans to split into two publicly traded entities \u2014 one for streaming and studio assets, the other for cable networks. The offers from media giants then came rolling in.",
      "In the event Netflix\u2019s bid is approved, Warner-owned cable brands like CNN, TBS and TNT would be housed under a separate public company.",
      "Comcast, the corporation that owns NBC News, similarly plans to spin off cable brands such as MS Now (formerly MSNBC) and CNBC into a separate public company.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped about 6% at the opening of trading, while Netflix shares fell 1.3% and Paramount shares advanced about 4%.",

      "Jamie Lee Curtis may have grown up the child of Hollywood royalty, but she says she's forged her career with a different mindset.",
      "The daughter of screen legends Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Jamie Lee Curtis was just 19 when she made her big-screen debut in John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic \"Halloween.\" Curtis went on to show off her comedy chops in a starring role on the ABC sitcom \"Anything But Love\" and in box office hits including \"Trading Places\" (1983), \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988) and \"Freaky Friday\" (2003).",
      "Now, nearly five decades into her career, Curtis, who turned 67 in November, is hotter ever. She won her first Academy Award in 2023 for her role as a dour IRS auditor in the surreal comedy \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" and then scored an Emmy the following year for a dramatic guest-starring role on \"The Bear.\"",
      "\"Nothing I have done actively has generated the amount of work I\u2019m doing now. There is no formula for this,\" Curtis told TODAY\u2019s Willie Geist in the Dec. 7 edition of Sunday Sitdown.",
      "\"I was lucky because my vanity was not my meal ticket,\" she continued, noting her parents' fame in the 1950s and '60s was hinged on their good looks.",
      "\"My parents were both known first and foremost for being beautiful. And talented,\" said Curtis. \"Neither one of them wanted to acknowledge the deep, dark, truthful mirror of aging and so they both tried to fend it off.\"",

      "\"And I think that may be the secret key is I don\u2019t give a s---,\" she added.",

      "In August 2023, Rachel Reid received news that changed her life. She was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.",
      "Four days later, she checked her Instagram direct messages and found a message from Canadian actor, writer and producer Jacob Tierney. In it, he inquired about her 2019 romance novel \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "They met over a Zoom call the next day. Tierney presented his vision for the show \u2014 \u201cwhich is exactly the show that everybody\u2019s seeing,\u201d Reid says.",
      "\u201cGetting that message at that time was pretty huge for me. It was exactly what I needed,\u201d the author tells TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cNot to be a bummer,\u201d she adds with a laugh. \u201cBut, like, it was great timing.\u201d",
      "More than two years later, she says she\u2019s doing OK amid her diagnosis and is determined to stay \u201coptimistic,\u201d especially as she looks into the future. After all, she now has a hit show on her hands.",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has become a phenomenon since it hit HBO Max in the U.S. on Nov. 28. Social media is filled with fan edits of the show\u2019s two leads: Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams, and Ilya Rozanov, played by Connor Storrie. The romance series reached HBO Max\u2019s top 10 TV shows within a week of its premiere.",
      "It\u2019s also led to renewed interest in Reid\u2019s book.",
      "\u201cIt feels, like, not real,\u201d Reid says. \u201cThe No. 1 book in the Kindle store is a sexually explicit gay hockey romance.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d is the second book in Reid\u2019s \u201cGame Changers\u201d book series, each of which spotlights a different couple against the backdrop of pro hockey.",
      "A lifelong Montreal Canadiens fan, Reid says the series started with her imagining what it would like for an NHL player to come out and be \u201chappy, safe and fulfilled by doing that.\u201d (The NHL has never had an out active player.)",
      "\u201cAnd then I just thought, OK, well if that happened, then what happens for other players? What\u2019s the ripple effect of that? And that became the rest of the series,\u201d she says.",
      "Shane and Ilya are part of that \u201cripple effect.\u201d Their story is told in 2019\u2019s \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d the second book in the series, and revisited in book six, titled \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d which published in April 2022.",
      "Below, Reid discusses her experience being \u201ckept in the loop\u201d throughout the process of developing \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d for TV, the first time she met actors Williams and Storie and if she\u2019d ever return to writing about Shane and Ilya.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Yeah, that was a pretty good day. I had actually been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease three or four days before that. So getting that message at that time was pretty huge for me. It was exactly what I needed.",
      "It all went pretty quickly. The next day, we had a Zoom call, and he laid out his whole vision for the show, which is exactly the show that everybody\u2019s seeing. I was just thrilled. I was trying to keep my cool about it, but afterward, I was definitely like, oh, my God. He\u2019s a pretty big deal in Canada, so I knew if he really wanted to do this, it would happen.",
      "Mostly I was just, like, kept in the loop. Jacob wrote all the scripts. I was not involved in writing them, but I did read them all. He sent them all to me \u2014 even early drafts, he just wanted my opinion. I think my approval was very important to him, which is very touching and nice.",
      "I went to visit set a few times. I don\u2019t know anything about filmmaking, so I wasn\u2019t really looking to interfere or anything. And I trusted Jacob completely, right from that first phone call. And the scripts were so good, so I didn\u2019t have any worries, really.",
      "I didn\u2019t expect to be so \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say, like, respected, but it\u2019s kind of that. I know other authors who have had their works adapted, and they did not have this experience that I had. Like either their works never really ended up being adapted at all, they were just optioned, and then then it never happened. Or, it was done in a way that they were very much not in the loop. I think a disappointing adaptation would be worse than no adaptation at all, probably.",
      "But for me, just the whole thing was a dream. And you can even see with the way that the promotion of the show is going, everybody\u2019s still mentioning the book, mentioning me, crediting me for so much. It\u2019s really nice. I wasn\u2019t expecting any of that.",
      "The first two, I love that they released them together because each one has so much going on. They\u2019re action packed, and I feel like they could have just done one at a time and still had everybody hooked, but giving everybody two to talk about, it\u2019s been fun.",
      "I have seen rough cuts of the rest of the episodes. I haven\u2019t seen the final. I said I wanted to wait and just watch it with everyone else, but the rough cuts were incredible. I truly do think the episodes get better and better, and the first two are very strong.",
      "I met them on set when I visited back in May (2025). That was my first time ever on a film set.",
      "I met Hudson first. He was filming the scene that we see in Episode 1, where he\u2019s turning on and off a lamp, waiting for Ilya to come to the hotel room, so there\u2019s no dialogue. Then I met him after very briefly, because he was very busy that day. I think he was in every scene that was being shot. He gave me a hug. It was definitely surreal, because I was just like, you really do seem like the character in so many ways.",
      "But when I got home from that trip, he sent me a lovely DM, saying how much he loved playing this character and that really meant a lot to me. So definitely endeared me to him right away.",
      "Connor, I met on set. He sort of stays in the Ilya voice all day when he\u2019s on set. So I basically met him as Ilya, which was kind of a lot to process for me. It wasn\u2019t until I went back and visited the set again and I got to sit down, have a beer with them, and meet him as Connor \u2014 totally different person.",
      "They\u2019re both just so wonderful. I told both of them when I was in Toronto last week, that just them being themselves is better marketing for the show than you could ever pay for. They\u2019re just so authentically themselves in every interview, they legitimately are nuts about each other, they\u2019re best friends. They say that all the time. They\u2019re just lovely people.",
      "I think I have to see them that way if I want to ever write anything with them again, because that is difficult. But their performances are so strong \u2014 I was telling Connor, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t remember what Ilya used to look like. Like, I can\u2019t see him in my head anymore. So that\u2019s tricky.",
      "I think the way Hudson plays Shane, that\u2019s kind of changed some of the story stuff for me. I was like, jeez, he\u2019s really in love with him, really quickly. You can see it on his face. So, yeah, that\u2019s a little bit different, but I like it.",
      "They play them the way they should be portrayed, which is very young and boyish and playful. I think sometimes in romance novels, no matter how old a character is, whether they\u2019re in college or whatever, we picture this rugged man. They\u2019re often kind of written that way, and I feel like maybe even I did that, too, with these characters. But when you see them actually brought to life onscreen, it\u2019s like, oh yeah, they\u2019re so young.",
      "Jacob took it very seriously. Like more seriously than romance ever gets taken. I hope it\u2019s going to change the way romance gets filmed. I don\u2019t think anybody thought you could actually take a high heat romance and really film it, you know? And he did. And I get the same feeling watching this that I get from reading a high heat romance. There\u2019s nothing different about it, it\u2019s all right there. I think that\u2019s really brave.",
      "I\u2019m constantly blown away by the fearless performances that Connor and Hudson have given us. But I do think this could be a big change for the way that romance gets filmed, but also maybe the way that romance as a genre gets viewed. I\u2019ve seen quite a few people online, especially men, who didn\u2019t seem to know that these books had this much sexiness in them. They assumed they were sort of Hallmark level. If they think that this is a very compelling study of a relationship \u2014 that\u2019s what romance is. It\u2019s deep character work, it\u2019s a study. I hope that people learn that and think about it more because there\u2019s some great writing in the romance genre and I don\u2019t think it gets respected very much. So God love Jacob Tierney for changing that.",
      "Yeah, but it\u2019s important to the story. It has to be because Scott is the ripple effect. I really love what Jacob did with this episode, and it was one of the first things he described to me about his vision when we spoke on the phone the first time \u2014 he really wanted to do this, this bottle episode.",
      "I know people are a little bit like, \u201cBut Shane and Ilya,\u201d but honestly, it\u2019s so good and it\u2019s so important to their story. And you\u2019ll see why later if you haven\u2019t read the books, it\u2019s all going to make sense.",
      "Yes, it is a huge risk to take the third episode of a six-episode series and make it about different characters. But I do think it was the right decision, and I really am proud of this episode, and I hope people like it. It really is a great, great episode, and I think it just enhances the overall story. And it\u2019s very sexy, if that helps.",
      "I was really touched that Jacob wanted to include that. Obviously, that\u2019s my first book. So sometimes, you think that one can be left out. But I mean, he took the best parts of it and made it into a nice episode, which I really liked.",
      "I was nervous about watching it the first time, because I think everybody has negative feelings about their first book. I always wish I could go back and and redo it, but that\u2019s kind of what happened here. Jacob took it and condensed it, and I was like, oh, it\u2019s pretty good when you cut out all the stuff that I don\u2019t like. (Laughs.)",
      "Nope. That had to be changed.",
      "I\u2019ll say this \u2014 their first time having intercourse, the decision was made to move that to the second episode to not have everything in the first episode. So because of that, the snowstorm was added to the first episode to delay their meeting. And then the Vegas rooftop happened. And then, yes, two seasons go by where Ilya is just relentlessly texting Shane.",
      "In the book, they are hooking up at that time because they\u2019ve already had intercourse. But obviously we can\u2019t skip that first time. Jacob said this is all my fault, because I didn\u2019t describe what happened in those two seasons in the book. But I was like, no, it\u2019s your fault for moving it to the second episode.",
      "That\u2019s really probably one of the biggest changes. There\u2019s not too many big changes, but that was just mainly just because of that weird kind of having to move that scene to the second episode.",
      "I have story ideas for them that I\u2019ve been working on. They never leave my head. I think my other characters do, but those guys stay with me.",
      "I definitely left them in \u201cThe Long Game\u201d at kind of an interesting point that probably people would like to see more of. So I do have story ideas. Some of them I\u2019m working on, I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with them, but there\u2019s going to be something. You\u2019ll see something for sure.",
      "I\u2019m doing OK. It mostly affects the right side of my body, which is my dominant side. So it does make writing and using a computer challenging. It makes signing books challenging. My plan next year is to do a lot, a lot of events, a lot of traveling, all of it, because I can. I\u2019m optimistic, because there\u2019s a lot of new treatments, a lot of talk of a possible cure. I feel like I\u2019m very early stages. I\u2019m 45, and that\u2019s pretty young for Parkinson\u2019s. But for the most part, yeah, I\u2019m mostly fine. I just shake a lot.",
      "It gave me something positive to focus on over the last two years, because otherwise I probably would have gotten very sad, but instead, I\u2019ve just been very excited. And then I thought maybe there\u2019d be an adrenaline drop after the premiere and all that stuff. But it\u2019s just been so fun. The response to the show has been so much bigger than any of us imagined.",
      "Maybe that drop comes next year, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but probably not, because I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll be, like, another season.",
      "New episodes of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d drop Fridays on HBO Max leading up to its season finale on Dec. 26."

      "But the choice of Cloud Dancer, which Pantone described as a \u201cbillowy\u201d white, has instead sparked heated controversy.",
      "People online have blasted the shade for being \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d and possibly not a color at all. After hearing the description of the color read during TODAY\u2019s Dec. 4 unveiling, Al Roker retorted \u201cotherwise known as white.\u201d",
      "Others have denounced Cloud Dancer as tone deaf and \u201cwhite washing,\u201d expressing other controversial takes.",
      "Read on to learn all about the controversy over Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year.",
      "What Is the Pantone Color of the Year?",
      "The Pantone Color Institute has been choosing an annual color of the year since late 1999 when it deemed Cerulean Blue 2000\u2019s Color of the Year, WWD reported. It called the soft blue shade the \u201cColor of the Millennium\u201d and said it inspired hope.",
      "The institute\u2019s color experts \u201ccomb the world looking for new color influences\u201d to choose its star shade each year, according to Pantone\u2019s website.",
      "Each year\u2019s color is influenced by everything from movies and fashion to art and travel destinations, and more. Colors are also inspired by lifestyle trends, new technologies, sports and socio-economic conditions.",
      "Additionally, a Pantone spokesperson tells TODAY.com, \u201cThe Pantone Color of the Year selection process is driven by the color/colors that are bubbling up across design and tying this to the zeitgeist.  The emotional resonance inherent in the color is key to the selection process.\u201d",
      "Other companies like Benjamin Moore and WGSN also choose an annual color of the year. The paint company chose Silhouette AF-655, a \u201cluxurious burnt umber with delicate notes of charcoal\u201d as its 2026 color. WGSN opted for Transformative Teal, the color \u201cfor a period of change and redirection.\u201d",
      "What Is Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year?",
      "When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as its 2026 pick, it described the color as \u201ca billowy, balanced white\u201d that\u2019s \u201cimbued with a feeling of serenity.\u201d",
      "Like a blank slate, the \u201cethereal\u201d Cloud Dancer is a symbol of a \u201ccalming influence in a frenetic society\u201d and signifies our desire to make a fresh start, the company stated.",
      "The color also hints at \u201cour search for balance between our digital future and our primal need for human connection,\u201d said Laurie Pressman, the Pantone Color Institute\u2019s vice president.",
      "Why Is the Choice Controversial?",
      "Though Pantone described Cloud Dancer as a serene color, it inspired a red-hot response after it was chosen as 2026's Color of the Year.",
      "While some people \u2014 including wedding planners on TikTok \u2014 celebrated the choice, many others found Cloud Dancer oddly bleak, or worse.",
      "\u201cYour choice is about as inspired as mayonnaise,\u201d one person wrote next to Pantone\u2019s announcement about Cloud Dancer on Instagram.",
      "\u201cPantonedeaf,\u201d another added, while one person commented, \u201cIt seems as if this selection, and the content created around it, was conceived in a vacuum completely removed from our collective social and political present. I\u2019d hope a brand that has this much cultural impact wouldn\u2019t operate with such a glaring blind spot.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving unseasoned chicken,\u201d jabbed another.",
      "When a Washington Post reporter asked for feedback about Cloud Dancer in a TikTok video, users didn't hold back.",
      "One person called the color \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cdystopian,\" writing, \u201cThe color of the year is no color. Just another example of the life being sucked out of us all.\u201d",
      "Another said its \u201clack of color\u201d was a \u201crecession indicator,\u201d joking, \u201cPantone can\u2019t afford color this year and neither can anyone else.\u201d",
      "With headlines all year reporting on the rise of white nationalism in the United States, many critics saw the choice of Cloud Dancer as either \u201ctone deaf\u201d or biased.",
      "\u201cSO\u2026 you all sat down and had some meetings. Rolled around some ideas. And in all those meetings, not a single one of you\u2026 in this moment where white supremacy is in the news everyday\u2026. thought, \u2018maybe now isn\u2019t the right time for this,\u2019\u201d one person wrote on Pantone\u2019s Instagram.",
      "\u201cWas \u2018klanrobe white\u2019 taken?\u201d added someone else.",
      "How Has Pantone Responded to the Controversy?",
      "Pressman addressed speculation that proclaiming white the color of the year could raise some eyebrows in an interview with Washington Post.",
      "\u201cSkin tones did not factor into this at all,\u201d Pressman said, noting Pantone has been asked similar questions in the past about other color picks. \u201cWith Peach Fuzz and then with Mocha Mousse, people were weighing in and asking if this was about skin tones. And I think we were going, \u2018Wow, really?\u2019 Because for us it\u2019s really about, at such a basic level, what are people looking for that color can hope to answer?\"",
      "During a Dec. 4 launch event, Pantone\u2019s president, Sky Kelley, said she knew Cloud Dancer would be a \u201cpretty controversial\u201d choice.",
      "Pantone\u2019s pick, she said in a speech caught on video by CNET, \u201csparks a conversation about color that everyone can participate in.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt Pantone, we don\u2019t dictate that conversation, we facilitate it.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, a Pantone spokesperson also explained the meaning behind the color\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cCloud Dancer visually represents a space to create, like a blank page ready for you to turn your inspiration into reality,\u201d the spokesperson said, in part. \u201cIt gives us the ability to become receptive both to what can be and what\u2019s ahead as Cloud Dancer suggests the inner peace we feel after clearing the noise around us.\u201d",
      "Explaining that the name plays a major role to \u201cconjure up a feeling,\u201d the spokesperson said that Cloud Dancer \u201creflects a universally shared experience: wherever we are in the world, we all look up to the buoyant clouds for inspiration, wonder, and to spark imagination.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cIn the simple act of looking up, we\u2019re connected by the drifting lightness of clouds. That universality is a huge part of why Cloud Dancer was selected as the Pantone Color of the Year 2026.\u201d"

      "\"In order for you to be confident, you got to be prepared,\" the real estate agent and Telemundo journalist tells TODAY.com. The Netflix reality show's second season is streaming now.",
      "After a few appearances on Season 1, now, Suero is taking the spotlight in the newest episodes, showing how she brings her bilingual, Dominican culture and go-getter one-liners to Ryan Serhant\u2019s real estate company, SERHANT.",
      "After immigrating to the U.S. at the age of 13 with her father, Suero put herself through college, earning a business and journalism degree. She says she worked multiple jobs, including eventually at Bloomingdale's, where one client told her that if Suero \u201ccan sell a cream to my husband, you can sell anyone a building.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s now been in the real estate game for eight years, four of them with SERHANT, on Nile Lundgren\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a little immigrant girl that came to this country with lots of dreams,\u201d Suero expresses in the sixth episode of Season 2.",
      "Suero tells TODAY.com that her stable real estate job, as well as coming in third place in the reality beauty pageant show \u201cNuestra Belleza Latina\u201d and landing a correspondent gig at Telemundo\u2019s \u201cEn Casa Con Telemundo,\u201d has since afforded her the opportunity to bring her mother to the states.",
      "In Season 2 of \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d Suero brings charisma, a hard work ethic, and saz\u00f3n to the table \u2014 as well as some famous faces...and some confrontations.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t like drama, but the drama comes to me!\u201d Suero says.",
      "Below, she chats with TODAY.com about what's really real about the real estate show, how she handles haters and more.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Thank you, and this is why I went to the Bronx, too, in the show. When I started in the (real estate) business, I wasn\u2019t going back and forth with Spanglish. Then when I (started working) in the Bronx, I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I can speak Spanish here.\u201d Finally, when I came to SERHANT... I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I feel comfortable here.\u201d I think I can truly be Genesis and show my Dominican, Latina essence in this place. I can be loud, I can scream. I can be intense, because you got to be intense to make it happen in New York. New York is not an easy city.",
      "I have always been like this. What you see on the show, what you're getting in this interview, is me.",
      "Well, I\u2019m glad that you went to my website and checked my SERHANT (page), because you can see all my deals. You can look up my license, you can see my client testimonials, which are there. And there\u2019s so many testimonials that need to be published that haven\u2019t, because I\u2019m running around. I\u2019ve been at SERHANT for four years, doing deals and moving on. I haven\u2019t even had the chance to sign the company's deal wall yet, because I do the deals, move on, follow up with my clients, and film \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d all at the same time also working for Telemundo. I\u2019m constantly moving. So it's real.",
      "I really don't like drama, but the drama comes to me! (Laughs.) If it comes to me, it's giving me a (story)line. But this specific drama caught me off guard. And as you can see, I proved her wrong, because I did not touch that client.",
      "I have worked so hard for many years, at Dominican restaurants, at the supermarket, at Bloomingdale's. In real estate, that kind of accusation is a little frightening. When someone comes to you with those accusations, knowing that you did not do that...I have all the proof. If you\u2019re going to accuse someone, you got to make sure that you got all the proof before you point fingers, because you don\u2019t know how hard the other person has been building their castle, brick by brick. So it's a real storyline. And I\u2019m there, debunking it.",
      "As an immigrant woman in New York, it\u2019s very hard to give people the time of day \u2014 your space, your energy, to make you feel down. But when it comes to something that you have been building for so many years \u2014 once again, I will go back to being an immigrant woman. As someone who has started from the bottom and then you get people that have had half of the struggle that you have endured in this wonderful country, you tend to question yourself. \u201cAm I presenting myself correctly to the world with what I\u2019m building? Am I speaking correctly, since English is my second language? Are they understanding my personality? Do they know about my culture?\u201d And the more they did it, honestly, it got to a boiling point where I felt a little overwhelmed.",
      "And now, it is time to show the world that behind the strong Dominican-Latina, there is a woman that has lots of feelings. Any human when others attempt to bring her down, to demean the work that she has done for years, it will hurt her, because real estate and my career at Telemundo are my babies. I'm gonna protect them from everyone. Como una mam\u00e1 leona. Voy con u\u00f1as y dientes...",
      "(In Spanish) But you get up \u2014 and I think we should be a little mischievous too. I\u2019m going to show them how I feel, but I\u2019m also going to f--- with them.",
      "I'm very close with Jessica Markowski, Jade (Shenker), Nile, of course, Ryan, and Peter (Zaitzeff).",
      "I want to tell you something. Liz, you as a fellow Latina, if they don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s their problem. I like all of them (laughs). There\u2019s nothing I can do to change your feelings if that\u2019s how you feel. I can control my emotions. I cannot control yours.",
      "I have interviewed Nicky Jam in the past, and we had great chemistry. He wanted to buy a building next to my office many years ago and he didn\u2019t. So when he started searching again, his publicist Kanessa Tixe contacted me. I said, \u201cGreat, this is the perfect client for me to show my lovers, \u2018my haters,\u2019 what I bring to the table.\" So it is not fake news or a storyline, but a real client who is qualified. It was also a way to show the world that Latinos are buying real estate.",
      "Latinos are not only spending on clothes and looking nice. Latinos now are building generational wealth, and one of the many assets that can help you build generational wealth is real estate, among many others. But Nicky Jam has decided to go the real estate route. He has many places in Miami and Latin America, and I am blessed that he decided that I was the broker he was going to work with in New York... He trusts me, a fellow Latina who has the knowledge and who can explain things to him in English and Spanish. It cannot get better than that!",
      "A lot of people get scared of the price tag. As a woman that came to this country thinking that all these luxury buildings were either offices or owned by the government or tourist attractions, when I learned that you can live inside these properties and how much they cost, I had to work on realizing that I belonged there, too.",
      "Although I wasn\u2019t born in this country and I\u2019m not from a big real estate family in New York, I know that I belong in those price ranges. What I did was I paid my dues.",
      "I started building my career and working very hard from selling properties of $100,000 to selling million-dollar properties. I did not let the price tag bring my confidence down and take my seat out of that table. I knew I could have a seat at that table.",
      "That is a question that many people ask me. With English being my second language and me having an accent, and it's very easy to mispronounce things... But I think Latinos are born with a flame inside.",
      "Latinos are born with a sparkle that gets ignited by having the opportunity to come to this country that offers people \u2014 and hard working and ambitious people \u2014 a better life, a better education. I think we are born with our spark... That comes out as being confident because we're not afraid of anything because we have gone through so much, and the only option we have is to be confident and to show the world that we can take on any challenge and make it happen. Doesn't matter the field, real estate, medicine, teacher, finance, politicians, designers...we just have it inside us."

I don't run a nonprofit bed and breakfast/candy cane factory with my beautiful three daughters, Holly, Tinsel and Popcorn String.

      "\"I was testing you. You've got the role! Ladies and gentlemen, (meet) Harry, the official 'Late Show' Prince of Christmas,\" Colbert said.",
      "Viewers and social media users got a kick out of the skit and weighed in on Instagram, calling it \"precious,\" \"hilarious\" and \"adorable.\"",
      "The Hallmark Channel even gave it the seal of approval, commenting, \"Prince Harry, how did you know we were looking for a horse-riding helicopter-flying American Hallmark Prince? No audition needed, you\u2019re hired!\""

    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

      "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Two of the main organizers of a marathon in Iran have been arrested after pictures circulated on social media showing women competing without the mandatory headscarf.",
      "\u201cOne of those arrested is an official in the Kish free trade zone,\u201d the Islamic republic\u2019s judiciary said in a statement Saturday on its official website Mizan Online, referring to the area on the island off Iran's southern coast that offers tax exemptions and customs duty relief for businesses and foreign companies.",
      "The second person arrested \u201cworks for the private company that organized the race,\u201d the judiciary added.",
      "The marathon was held Friday on Kish Island and drew more than 5,000 participants, local media reported.",
      "Images of female runners also spread online. Some showed them documenting the marathon and posing with their medals after they finished the 26.2-mile race. Some were without a hijab, while others wore headband-style coverings that sat across the forehead and scalp but did not conceal their ponytails or braids.",
      "Right after the race the island\u2019s public prosecutor told Mizan Online that warnings about the need to follow national laws, religious norms and professional rules in holding the marathon had been ignored.",
      "The organizers \u201cdid not take these warnings seriously\u201d and violated \u201cpublic decency\u201d by allowing women to compete without the legally required headscarf, or hijab, Ali Salemizadeh said.",
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, a conservative-dominated body that sets the country\u2019s cultural and educational policies, also criticized the race in a statement reported by the state-run broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).",
      "Calling the behavior \u201cshame breaking and organized,\u201d it said security and judicial bodies should identify and deal firmly with such movements to prevent similar cases from happening again.",
      "The hijab has been compulsory for women in Iran since the early 1980s, accompanied by stringent dress code regulations mandating modest, loose-fitting clothing in public.",
      "However, enforcement of these laws has been less consistent after nationwide protests following the death of Mahsa Amini on Sept. 16, 2022. The 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman died in a hospital three days after she was detained by the country\u2019s morality police for allegedly not adhering to the rules on headscarves for women and clothing restrictions.",
      "The intense crackdown that followed has largely stifled the protest movement, with new detentions and legislation.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News earlier this year, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said forcing women to wear the hijab and recent crackdowns in his country were wrong. \u201cHuman beings have a right to choose,\u201d he said.",
      "And speaking at Beheshti University in the capital, Tehran, on Sunday, Pezeshkian said that hijab regulations shouldn\u2019t be imposed through coercion, according to the IRIB.",
      "\u201cThe issue of hijab is not a simple matter and cannot be resolved through compulsion or confrontation,\u201d the broadcaster quoted Pezeshkian as saying. He added that the government must act \u201cpersuasively,\u201d rather than rely on force.",
      "However, his more moderate stance has sparked backlash from more hard-line factions in the Iranian government, a theocratic structure that is ultimately ruled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "Amin Khodadadi reported from Tehran and Elmira Aliieva from London."

      "The flooding last week damaged at least 300 to 400 works in one of the Egyptian antiquities libraries in the museum, Francis Steinbock, the deputy general administrator, told French broadcast station BFM TV.",
      "The flooding led to a burst pipe and affected one of the three rooms of the library in the Egyptian antiquities department, he said.",
      "A complete count of affected works is underway, he said.",
      "Steinbock described some of the works as books \u2014 some several hundred years old and dating to the late 19th century. He said that some of the books were wet and that work is underway to dry them, including dehumidifying them page by page with the help of Buffard paper and modifying plants.",
      "Some of the works are visual periodicals and archaeology journals that are consulted by Egyptologists, Louvre staff members and researchers, he said.",
      "He noted that the area of the pipe break is part of museum spaces that will undergo a major renovation of the ventilation and heating system starting in September.",

      "Sudan is facing what the World Food Program has called \u201cthe humanitarian crisis of our time,\u201d as tens of millions struggle through sieges, blockades and aid shortages that have pushed entire cities into famine.",
      "What began as a power struggle between rival generals more than two years ago has since plunged Sudan into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced millions from their homes, with mass killings leaving bloody sand visible from space and ruined infrastructure.",
      "Sudan \u201cis the largest humanitarian crisis in the world today,\u201d Leni Kinzli, the WFP\u2019s Sudan communications officer, told NBC News on Sunday. \u201cIt can no longer be forgotten or ignored, simply because the severity and the scale is one that has really not been seen at this level.\u201d",
      "At least 21.2 million people \u2014 roughly 45% of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 are now facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the internationally recognized system for assessing famine and food insecurity. Famine conditions have been confirmed in Darfur\u2019s el-Fasher and Kadugli, where \u201cpeople have endured months without reliable access to food or medical care,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has said.",
      "Kinzli described a landscape where even relatively calm areas remain fragile, while other regions edge deeper into hunger. She said WFP can reach 4 million to 5 million people with food and nutrition support each month and has the capacity to assist 8 million, but \u201cthe resources we have available are not keeping pace with the need.\u201d",
      "Aid delivery remains extremely difficult in violence-ridden areas, where conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to shape the crisis.",
      "That includes el-Fasher, which was under siege by the RSF for more than 18 months, during which time \u201cabsolutely no\u201d aid supplies were able to get in, added Kinzli. The RSF eventually overran the Sudanese army\u2019s last major stronghold in Darfur in October.",
      "In South Kordofan, a drone attack by Sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten on Thursday, killing 50 people, including 33 children, according to a local doctors' group.",
      "United Nations aid teams in Sudan issued a joint statement on Thursday warning that the violence \u201cis restricting access to food, medicine and essential supplies, and is limiting farmers\u2019 access to their fields and markets, heightening the risk of famine spreading across the Kordofan states.\u201d",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned: \u201cWe must not allow Kordofan to become another el-Fasher. It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in el-Fasher.\u201d",
      "And on the ground, conditions are already bleak.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing pretty much the same exact things in the state of South Kordofan,\u201d said Dr. Mohamed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for Sudan Doctors Network. The RSF is \u201cdoing the same siege, the same blockade, they are not allowing food or medicine to get into the cities,\u201d he told NBC News, adding that between Sept. 20 and Oct. 20 of this year, 23 children died from severe malnutrition.",
      "For the past three months, Sudanese civilians have endured RSF attacks, Elsheikh said, including widespread atrocities and human rights violations, with civilians executed arbitrarily and key infrastructure \u2014 such as hospitals, clinics, schools and homes \u2014 deliberately targeted by airstrikes.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network has documented 19 cases of rape committed by RSF forces against women who fled the fighting in el-Fasher and arrived at the al-Afad camp in al-Dabbah, said Elsheikh.",
      "Fighting in Sudan began in April 2023, when the Sudanese military, led by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, clashed with his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti, who leads the RSF.",
      "Both men had previously led counterinsurgency operations against uprisings in the region, a conflict that in 2005 contributed to Omar al-Bashir becoming the first sitting head of state indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.",
      "Burhan and Dagalo were part of the military establishment that ousted al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest. Two years later, they agreed to share power following a coup that brought down the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.",
      "However, their alliance broke down spectacularly over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, full-scale fighting erupted, dragging Sudan deeper into conflict and a humanitarian crisis.",
      "With no resolution in sight, the war is becoming only more entrenched and chaotic, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, told NBC News. What began as a two-sided struggle has splintered into a tangle of local battles, reopening old regional grievances and eroding whatever central authority once existed, she said.",
      "Both sides have shifted \u201cfrom trying to win this war to trying not to lose,\u201d she added, noting that as the fighting regionalizes, it has produced \u201csmaller fronts, smaller conflicts, which has complicated the chain of command,\u201d making even a negotiated ceasefire nearly impossible to enforce.",
      "Nearly 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, and they have been displaced within the country or are living in neighboring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "Funding for the regional response is less than 10% of what is needed, it said, making it impossible to cover basic needs.",
      "But where funding is available, and where fighting has abated, some areas have shown signs of recovery.",
      "Last year, there were 10 areas confirmed to be suffering from famine, said Kinzli, but \u201cnow there are only two.\u201d Around 3.4 million people who were previously at \u201ccrisis\u201d levels are no longer classified as such, reflecting limited stabilization in parts of Khartoum, Al Jazirah and Sennar, where some families have begun to return.",
      "While these gains remain narrow and uneven, and the situation remains dire, \u201cthis shows that when we have access and funding, we can reverse famine and improve the situation,\u201d Kinzli added. \u201cThe humanitarian response can really make a difference if and when we are able to deliver.\u201d"

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 As smoke quickly filled the corridors of a 31-story tower in Hong Kong last week, Rhodora Alcaraz found herself trapped alone with a 3-month-old baby.",
      "The 28-year-old migrant worker had arrived in the Chinese territory from the Philippines only a day earlier to work for a family living in a high-rise housing estate. When a massive fire ignited in the middle of the afternoon, tearing across seven of the estate\u2019s eight buildings, Alcaraz shielded the baby in her arms and was rescued by firefighters just in time, along with her employer\u2019s elderly mother.",
      "Hong Kong, an international financial hub of 7.5 million people, is home to hundreds of thousands of domestic helpers like Alcaraz, mostly women from low-income Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.",
      "The bravery of Alcaraz and other domestic helpers during the Nov. 27 blaze at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po, which killed at least 159 people, has put a spotlight on the critical role they play in the city, where they work for low wages and often live in cramped homes alongside employers who heavily rely on them for housework and caregiving.",
      "At least 10 domestic helpers were killed in the fire, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.",
      "\u201cWe are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire,\u201d Chris Sun, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for labor and welfare, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "He added that families of the domestic helpers who died will receive about 800,000 Hong Kong dollars ($100,000) in condolence and compensation payments.",
      "The Tai Po fire, the deadliest in Hong Kong in almost 80 years, has shocked and angered the public amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight. Authorities say the rapid spread of the five-alarm fire was caused by the use of highly flammable materials around the buildings during renovations.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, John Lee, said this week that a judge-led independent committee would be set up to \u201creview\u201d the fire, which displaced thousands of people from their homes. Almost two dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and fraud in separate investigations.",
      "Alcaraz was still recovering in the hospital and was seen wearing purple scrubs and a mask in a picture posted by Philippines Sen. Imee Marcos.",
      "\u201cI salute you, Rhodora, and all overseas foreign workers who continue to sacrifice for their families even while far from home,\u201d she said in a Facebook post Sunday after visiting Alcaraz in the hospital.",
      "While authorities and aid agencies announced several support measures for affected residents, including transitional housing and a donor-supported reconstruction fund that has raised about 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($360 million), the fire creates additional uncertainty for domestic helpers, who live in Hong Kong on dedicated visas and are entitled to far fewer rights than a typical resident.",
      "A helper\u2019s salary starts at about $650 a month.",
      "Even with an additional food allowance of about $160, they still earn below the minimum wage in Hong Kong, which at about $5.40 an hour amounts to $860 a month for a 40-hour workweek. They are also ineligible for permanent residency, which in most cases can be obtained by living in the city for seven years.",
      "Many domestic helpers are mothers themselves, sending most of their earnings to their children back home to support their education.",
      "\u201cThey have deep trauma now. Whenever they pass by the building, they always cry. Some had friends who died in that building,\u201d said Sring Sringatin, a domestic helper in Hong Kong who is chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union.",
      "Sringatin said helpers from Wang Fuk Court were still residing with their employers, either in temporary shelters or alternative housing. Previously, they would often share a room with the family\u2019s children. Now that their employers are homeless, accommodating helpers has become even more difficult, according to Sringatin and other aid workers who have met with affected helpers.",
      "It is also unclear whether employers whose homes have been destroyed will be able to pay their salaries on time, even as the workers \u2014 who are so embedded with families that they often act as the primary caregivers to children and elderly relatives \u2014 continue providing care.",
      "\u201cThey just follow the families if there is care to be given,\u201d said Johannie Tong, a community relations officer for the nonprofit group Mission for Migrant Workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a default for them. The disaster has happened, but they are still working. They don\u2019t have this question, whether I should work,\u201d said Tong, who visited some of the displaced workers over the past week in government-run temporary shelters that journalists could not access.",
      "Before the fire, workers got little time to themselves. In most cases they worked six days a week, meeting fellow workers on Sundays at parks and other public places to sing karaoke, do each other\u2019s nails or enjoy picnics. Now they are not only traumatized, but they may also be facing more pressure at work and feeling isolated at a time when they are far away from their families, Tong and Sringatin said.",
      "\u201cThey are trying their best to perform their duties, but at the same time they need to be strong, because as a domestic worker there is this feeling that they don\u2019t have anyone in here,\u201d Sringatin said.",
      "Tong said her charity was trying to determine what kind of long-term help workers might need, including immigration assistance or support for their families back home. In the short term, she said, there are ample donations at their center in Hong Kong\u2019s Jordan neighborhood, where workers on Monday were sorting through clothes, toiletries, medicines and more.",
      "Mission for Migrant Workers said it had obtained a SIM card for Alcaraz to use to communicate with her family back in the Philippines.",
      "\u201cSince she hasn\u2019t recovered her voice yet, she just gave a thumbs-up and smiled to express her joy and appreciation,\u201d the charity said Wednesday."

      "LONDON \u2014 Europe faces \u201ccrunch time\u201d on the war in Ukraine, a former European president told NBC News, as the continent battles internal division, Russian threats and open hostility from the United States.",
      "Leaders on the continent are feeling \u201cgenuine fear and distrust regarding the United States,\u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who led Estonia for a decade until 2016, told NBC News in an interview Thursday. But he also warned that Europe\u2019s internal division \u201cultimately shows the weakness\u201d of the bloc, and he feared what might happen \u201cunless we start getting our act together.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours before European powers held urgent negotiations Friday on how to keep Ukraine\u2019s war effort alive and before President Donald Trump published his National Security Strategy that spelled out in black and white Washington\u2019s dissatisfaction toward many of its partners across the pond.",
      "Trump had already left Europe out of this week\u2019s negotiations between his envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finding itself sidelined, the European Union is trying to formulate its own proposal: using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Even that, however, is facing opposition from Belgium, fearing Russian retaliation.",
      "Putin on Thursday reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met. He spoke after his predecessor, the hawkish Dmitry Medvedev, said using Russian money to aid Ukraine would be tantamount to a \u201ccasus belli\u201d \u2014 or an act justifying war \u2014 a common Kremlin refrain of his during the 45-month conflict.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time, I think, for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d said Ilves, who served two stints as foreign minister before taking Estonia\u2019s top job.",
      "For Europe, this is about more than just Ukraine; they worry any peace that favors Putin will embolden him to attack and meddle elsewhere on the continent, which has seen an uptick in drone incursions and cyberattacks over the past year.",
      "His war machine is making slow progress on the battlefield but suffering heavy casualties. Kyiv, meanwhile, is running low on money and resources, while suffering a manpower shortage and facing allegations of governmental corruption."

    "story": [
      "The European Commission said Friday it was fining Elon Musk\u2019s social media app X with the equivalent of $140 million, saying that it had breached the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook \u2014 a move that will likely draw the ire of the American government.",
      "The European Commission found that X violated the Digital Services Act, a sweeping 2022 law that requires internet companies to aggressively combat hate speech and misinformation.",
      "The law \u2014 one of the most far-reaching attempts to fight problematic material online \u2014 mandates that companies set up policies and procedures to remove posts deemed illegal by countries within the 27-country union.",
      "The penalty drew swift condemnation from Vice President JD Vance even before the European Commission announced it.",
      "\u201cRumors swirling that the E.U. commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a post on X that the fine \u201cisn\u2019t just an attack on @X, it\u2019s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.\u201d",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment, but several hours before the European Commission released details on the fine, he shared an X post from Preston Byrne, which advocated for the passage of a U.S. bill that would allow companies and individuals to sue foreign entities in American court over claims of foreign censorship.",
      "Called the GRANITE Act and written by Byrne, an attorney and head of compliance at a cryptocurrency company, it has been filed or is being considered in several state legislatures but does not appear to have been introduced formally at the federal level.",
      "The European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive branch, has said its laws do not target any nationality and that it is defending its digital and democratic standards.",
      "After the fine was issued, Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission\u2019s tech chief, said it was proportionate and calculated based on the nature of the infringements, their gravity in terms of affected E.U. users and their duration.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to underline that DSA is having nothing to do with censorship,\u201d Virkkunen told reporters, according to The Associated Press. Forthcoming decisions on companies which have been charged with DSA violations are expected to take a shorter time than the two years for the X case, she added.",
      "But Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission criticized the decision in a post on X. \u201cOnce again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEurope is taxing Americans to subsidize a continent held back by Europe's own suffocating regulations.\u201d",
      "The proposed penalty nearly two years in the making came after regulators said in late 2023 that they had opened proceedings into X over suspected failure to combat content disinformation and manipulation. X was the first company to face such an investigation when the probe started.",
      "At the start, regulators said the proceedings were about several issues including the alleged dissemination of illegal content \u201cin the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d and a suspicion that X had a \u201cdeceptive design\u201d in how it handed out blue verification checks to paying users.",
      "Musk, the wealthiest person in the world by some measures, has had rocky relations with European leaders even aside from the investigation into X. In January, the leaders of four European countries, including France and Germany, denounced his influence and warned that Musk should not involve himself in their nations\u2019 domestic politics.",
      "Musk, a former close ally of President Donald Trump, has helped to fuel a wave of far-right candidates across Europe and the globe, although many of his candidates have fallen short of winning power.",
      "X could appeal the commission\u2019s findings in European courts.",
      "In April, after rumors spread that the commission was on the verge of issuing a penalty against X, the company said it was prepared to fight.",
      "\u201cIf the reports that the European Commission is considering enforcement actions against X are accurate, it represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech,\u201d the company said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cX has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe,\u201d the company said."

      "\u201cNo medical intervention was required and the pendant passed naturally,\u201d police said in a statement.",

      "The man accused of swallowing the pendant underwent a medical assessment following his arrest and was monitored by police around the clock in the hope that it would emerge on its own.",
      "\u201cAn officer is assigned to constantly monitor the man,\u201d Auckland Central Area Commander Inspector Grae Anderson said Wednesday before the pendant had been recovered.",
      "\u201cGiven this man is in Police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\u201d he said."

      "Alfonso Morales, secretary-general of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, said \u201cthe situation in Gaza, despite the ceasefire and the approval of the peace process, and Israel\u2019s use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.\u201d",

I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he\u2019d like to make a deal.\"",
      "Following the meeting with Putin in Moscow, Witkoff and Kushner invited Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, to a meeting in Miami on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Umerov accepted, the official said, and negotiations for a potential peace deal will continue in Florida on Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X that world powers need to keep pressuring Russia about the conflict.",
      "\"Right now, the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war, and current diplomatic activity in negotiations must be backed by pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everything depends on this combination \u2014 constructive diplomacy plus pressure on the aggressor. Both components work toward peace.\"",
      "Some European nations have expressed extreme disquiet at apparently having been sidelined in talks, however.",
      "\u201cFor any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\u201d the E.U.\u2019s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters last month.",
      "Lithuania\u2019s national security adviser, K\u0119stutis Budrys, told journalists in Brussels last month that Europe\u2019s security \u201cmust not be discussed without Europe.\u201d",
      "Russia wanted \u201cto push out Americans from Europe and to review the security architecture\u201d on the continent, he added.",
      "Lithuania sits between the Russian territory of Kaliningrad and Belarus, a staunch Kremlin ally, and the Soviet Union occupied it until the end of communism in 1990. It and fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia have long feared an emboldened Russia.",
      "European leaders were also blindsided by Trump\u2019s 28-point plan last month, which was seen as leaving not just Ukraine, but also the whole continent vulnerable.",
      "Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" said William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was when Colin Powell was absent in 2003, which was attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "Asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during the ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies, and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite having been sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",
      "He added that \"it may seem that the Europeans are powerless in the face of Trump\u2019s style of leadership\" but that \"we already have seen the so-called 'peace plan' change radically over the past days, with Ukrainian and European concerns increasingly reflected.\"",
      "Before he met with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts, from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he said.",
      "There was no real expectation of a breakthrough heading into the talks in Moscow, as the Kremlin did not show any intention of easing off on its hard-line demands.",
      "Still, Moscow called the five-hour conversation \u201cuseful\u201d and said some points could be agreed on, while Putin viewed others \u201cnegatively.\u201d The parties also discussed the issue of territories \u2014 a key and very sensitive point for Ukraine \u2014 and some American proposals on that looked \u201cmore or less acceptable\u201d to the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",
      "Also Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiha, said the U.S. team had invited the Ukrainian delegation to \"continue our talks in America in the near future.\""

    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, for a \"constructive\" five-hour meeting Tuesday, but more work needs to be done, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin, said in a video the Kremlin posted online.",
      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "He added: \u201cOnly Putin can end this war on the Russian side. \u2026 We have tried to bring both sides together and see what proposals we could come up with that both sides could live with. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make it work.\u201d",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin simply doesn\u2019t want a deal that\u2019s anything short of what it wants,\u201d such as a watered-down security guarantee for Ukraine and territorial concessions by Kyiv, said Michael A. Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
