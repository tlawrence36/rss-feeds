    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is coming back to the White House, but don't expect another \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d or much fire and fury in book publishing in general",
      "NEW YORK -- As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling \u201cFire and Fury\u201d or her own blockbuster, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat else is there to learn?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.\u201d",
      "For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.",
      "Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d former national security adviser John Bolton's \u201cThe Room Where it Happened\u201d and Bob Woodward's \u201cFear.\u201d Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's \u201cA Handmaid's Tale,\u201d which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.",
      "But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family \u2014 they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's \u201cWho Could Ever Love You\u201d and Woodward's \u201cWar\u201d were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been there many times, with all those books,\u201d HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books \u2014 perhaps analyzing the recent election \u2014 because \u201cthere's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,\u201d one that would welcome \u201can intelligent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the reboot of any hit TV show,\u201d says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cYou\u2019re not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it\u2019s replacing.\u201d",
      "In the days following Trump's victory, \u201cThe Handmaid's Tale\u201d and George Orwell's \u201c1984\u201d returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny,\" a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and Hegseth's \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d \u2014 and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.",
      "First lady Melania Trump's memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.",
      "\u201cThe Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,\u201d says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. \u201cAfter Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.\u201d",
      "Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers \u2014 most recently Hachette Book Group \u2014 have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists \u2014 if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.",
      "A new \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a \u201cknown peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.\u201d",
      "A publicist for Wolff said he was declining comment.",
      "Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller \u201cRage,\u201d told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how \u201cout of control he gets,\u201d Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.",
      "\u201cHe wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.\u201d",
      "___",
      "1. \u201cToo Much and Never Enough,\u201d by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies",
      "2. \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff: 936,116 copies",

      "5. \u201cRage,\u201d by Bob Woodward: 549,685 copies",
      "These figures represent total sales provided by Circana, which tracks about 85% of the print market and does not include e-book or audiobook sales."

      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original, writes Associated Press Film...",
      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original.",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens in theaters Wednesday, was originally put into development as a streaming series before it was rerouted the big screen. Curiously, though, it\u2019s not scale or spectacle lacking here. Directors David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller have made an often dazzlingly animated film that is, visually, a step up from 2016\u2019s \u201cMoana.\u201d",
      "But in a story that brings in a literal boatload of new characters, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that \u201cMoana 2\u201d got caught in the crosswinds \u2014 too blown between shifting studio imperatives to really find its own way.",
      "That\u2019s a shame because the original \u201cMoana\u201d is about the lightest, most joyful animated movie Disney has made in a decade \u2013 with the possible exception of \u201cEncanto,\u201d which likewise bounced to the buoyant rhythms of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. (Miranda is crucially absent in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d though \u201cHamilton\u201d director Thomas Kail is currently developing a live-action \u201cMoana.\u201d)",
      "Photorealistic remakes have been the more dominant providence of the Magic Kingdom in recent years, a trend that\u2019s made more whimsical, imagination-filled animations like \u201cMoana\u201d all the more exceptional. Here was a movie that somehow balanced Pacific Island cultural authenticity with the cartoony delights of a demigod turned accidental shark and Jemaine Clement as a singing, flaunting giant crab. Talk about win win.",
      "Such inventiveness is harder to come by in the perfectly earnest but not especially inspired \u201cMoana.\u201d It opens with a visibly grown Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho, returning) engaged in a search for evidence of Pacific Islanders beyond her home island. She is by now a mythic figure, herself, to her people, idolized by youngsters for her courage and for being \u201csuper-besties\u201d with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson, also back).",
      "When Moana turns up an artifact with evidence of a two-peaked island, Motufetu, fabled as the once binding center of their ancestors, she sets out to find the cursed island and reunite the disparate people of Oceania. This time, though, Moana is sailing with a more crowded boat.",
      "Some of the old sidekicks \u2014 the rooster Heihei (with noises courtesy of Alan Tudyk) and the pig Pua \u2014 are back. But Moana decides she needs human help this time, and brings along a crew featuring the uber Maui fan Moni (Hual\u0101lai Chung), the engineer Loto (Rose Matefeo) and the curmudgeonly older farmer Kele (David Fane).",
      "Each of these characters has one generic note to play, and while you could see the need to add in more personalities for a series (Moana also now has a cute little sister, voiced by Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda), they are effectively dead weight in \u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "To me, the iconic image of these films is Moana as a solo adventurer, leaning against the wind in her camakau and setting an unknown course. Sure, Maui is inevitably her buddy-comedy partner in adventure, but Moana and her canoe should permit passengers no more than John Wayne did on his horse.",
      "After an encounter with the coconut brigade of the Kakamora, Moana and Maui eventually reunite via a giant clam, where Maui has been trapped by Matangai (Awhimai Fraser, having fun), a mysterious, bat-adorned figure who\u2019s a kind of villain for the movie. She\u2019s more interesting than some recent Disney antagonists and gets probably the best song (\u201cGet Lost\u201d) in a movie that mightily misses Miranda\u2019s touch. (The songs are by Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.)",
      "That scene and the climactic one, with a sea of tornadoes spinning across stormy waters, are vividly drawn \u2014 enough, surely, to delight younger moviegoers. Coming fast on the heels of \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the most salient selling points of \u201cMoana 2\u201d may be its comparatively nimble running time. At 100 minutes, it\u2019s a full hour shorter than \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Ironically, \u201cMoana 2\u201d \u2014 beefed up from a would-be series \u2014 has brevity in its favor. But the hopes for \u201cMoana 2\u201d should go beyond mere placeholder. Only a few times does the banter between Moana and Maui really remind you of the fun that characterized the original. In one such moment, Moana corrects Maui after he calls her \u2014 perhaps confusing Moana for many other Disney protagonists \u2014 a princess. His comeback? \u201cWell, a lot of people think you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/peril. Running time: 100 minutes. Two stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "After almost a year of testimony, closing statements began in the YSL gang and racketeering trial that included rapper Young Thug",
      "ATLANTA -- Prosecutors said Monday that the last two defendants in a long-running gang and racketeering trial committed murder on behalf of an Atlanta street gang co-founded by rapper Young Thug.",
      "But defense attorneys said the state slapped together cherry-picked social media posts and song lyrics with unreliable witness testimony to paint a misleading narrative about young men from tough upbringings who tried to escape poverty through music.",
      "It\u2019s now up to a jury to decide whether to convict Shannon Stillwell and Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, on gang, murder, drug and gun charges. The original indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.",
      "The trial for six of those defendants began a year ago. Four of them, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty last month. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after weeks of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",
      "The trial has been plagued by problems and delays. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker, who took over the case in July after the original judge was recused, often lost patience with prosecutors.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d in an Atlanta barbershop. Prosecutors say Thomas was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged with the 2022 murder of Shymel Drinks in retaliation for the murders of two YSL associates days earlier, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, co-founded a criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they said was associated with the national Bloods gang. Young Thug's record label is also known as YSL, for Young Stoner Life. Kendrick was featured on two popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d and another Young Thug song that prosecutors played during their closing.",
      "Doug Weinstein, Kendrick's defense attorney, said it was wrong for prosecutors to target the defendants \u2014 all Black \u2014 for their music and lyrics.",
      "Prosecutor Simone Hylton said the case was about \u201creal bodies,\u201d not a \u201csong over a beat.\u201d",
      "\"We are targeting gang members who decided to wreak havoc on communities in Fulton County,\" Hylton said. \u201cAnd those communities that they violated, those communities were communities of color.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Christian Adkins said YSL was a violent gang that operated through \u201cdeception, intimidation, destruction and death.\u201d",
      "He pointed to social media posts in which he said showed members admittedly killed people in rival gangs and said their clothes and tattoos were \u201cwalking billboards\u201d for YSL.",
      "Weinstein and Stillwell's defense attorney, Max Schardt, said prosecutors threw a bunch of separate alleged crimes, many from around a decade ago, into an indictment without showing that they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"The state has spent the past year with a hammer in their hand banging on a square peg that they call evidence,\" Schardt said.",
      "But \u201cthat square peg does not fit in that round hole,\u201d he said.",
      "Alleged YSL affiliates said during the trial they lied to police to avoid long prison sentences. Schardt theorized one of those witnesses killed Thomas. He framed Stillwell, Kendrick and others as a part of his string of lies to avoid the threat of prison, Schardt said.",
      "But Hylton said that witnesses and others lied on the stand when they were in front of the people \u201cthey snitched on,\u201d not to the police.",
      "Before he got \u201csucked up in this targeting of Jeffery Williams,\u201d Weinstein said Kendrick was focused on the rap career that helped him move on from his troubled past after plans to play football at the University of Georgia fell through.",
      "His client wasn\u2019t even in the car used in the drive-by shooting that killed Thomas, Weinstein said. But prosecutors said Kendrick was the one who alerted his counterparts about Thomas' whereabouts before he was murdered.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just as guilty as the ones who pulled the trigger,\u201d Hylton said.",
      "Schardt said surveillance footage showed Stillwell drove away from Drinks' car before he was shot, and there was no gunshot residue found in Stillwell's vehicle. Hylton said the footage proved Stillwell fled the scene at 90 miles per hour through a red light after shooting at least three rounds into Drinks' Nissan.",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Tuesday. If they do not reach a verdict Wednesday, they will return after Thanksgiving.",

      "Each year has something new in store. In 2019, Wrapped included a summary of users\u2019 streaming trends for the entire decade. Last year, Spotify matched listeners to a Sound Town based on their artist affinities and how it lined up with those in other parts of the world.",
      "So far, the streaming platform has kept the highly anticipated release date of Wrapped under \u2026 er, wraps.",
      "In past years, it\u2019s been released after Thanksgiving, between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6.",

      "Other major streaming platforms such as Apple Music and YouTube Music have developed their own versions of Wrapped in recent years.",

      "Bravo said in a press release Tuesday that the upcoming season would feature \u201ca new group of close-knit SUR-vers who are as complicatedly involved with one another as their iconic predecessors.\u201d",
      "The series debuted in 2013 as a spinoff to \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d executive produced and starring Vanderpump, a restaurateur. It focused on the personal lives of select staff at her West Hollywood restaurant, SUR, with Vanderpump in the role of both boss and maternal figure.",
      "With in-fighting, cheating scandals, changing alliances and non-stop drama, the cast seemed destined to be followed by reality TV cameras.",

The Toms, as they're known, branched off with different owners for a second bar called Schwartz & Sandy's \u2014 on Monday, they announced that venture would be closing its doors.",
      "In 2023, the show reached a different level of attention and wider audience with the revelation of what became known as \u201cScandoval\u201d: It was revealed that Sandoval, who lived with his longtime partner and co-star, Ariana Madix, had been having an affair with another cast member, Rachel \u201cRaquel\u201d Leviss.

It was followed by a three-part reunion that took place weeks after the discovery.",
      "The cast, sans Leviss, returned to filming for Season 11 with Sandoval attempting to make amends with the others. Madix would film in group scenes with Sandoval but refused to interact with him 1:1, leading to friction within the group. During this year's reunion, Madix tearfully said to Sandoval, \u201cI just want you away from me.\u201d Shortly after, it was revealed the show was \u201con pause.\u201d",
      "While many key \u201cVanderpump\u201d cast members have not released statements or did not immediately respond to requests for comment, a few shared complicated feelings online.",
      "\u201cim feeling at peace with closing this chapter and im excited for everything that is to come,\u201d Madix posted on Instagram. \u201ci don\u2019t know that these were the best days of our lives, but they were definitely something special.\u201d",
      "The scandal and its fallout, though, made Madix America\u2019s sweetheart. She received a plethora of endorsement deals, was cast on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and on Broadway as Roxie Hart in \u201cChicago.\u201d She also was named the new host of \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d Earlier this year, Madix opened a sandwich shop in Los Angeles called Something About Her with another \u201cVanderpump\u201d star, Katie Maloney.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag. But I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d said Maloney, whose rocky relationship with now-ex-husband Tom Schwartz was chronicled in the series, in an Instagram story. \u201cThank you for the memories and the love the last 11 years.\u201d",
      "\"I have such mixed feelings right now. It\u2019s no secret I do not like change. This is the exception,\u201d Lala Kent posted on Instagram. Kent previously told The Associated Press she benefited from Scandoval with the sale of merch. She \u2014 along with current and former cast members \u2014 also devoted episodes of their individual podcasts to dissecting the drama.",
      "Kent, Shay and Schwartz will make appearances on the second season of the successful \u201cVanderpump\u201d spin-off, \u201cThe Valley,\u201d which will air next year. That show stars Kristen Doute, a former \u201cVanderpump\u201d star who along with Stassi Schroeder was fired in 2020 for racially profiling a Black co-worker. Two others, Max Boyens and Brett Caprioni, were also let go at the time over tweets with racial slurs.",
      "Bravo will also air a retrospective for the original show in 2025."

      "Her secret weapon is a 47-year-old northern governor who occasionally sings more traditional \u201cbanda\u201d songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the ideas we came up with was in Durango,\u201d said Sheinbaum. \"We talked about it with the governor, I don\u2019t know if you knew, but he is a \u2018banda\u2019 singer.\u201d",

      "It follows a similar filing in New York on Monday, in which Drake alleges UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify and other streaming services.",
      "The two court moves have taken the bitter beef between the two hip-hop superstars to a whole new level, with the parent company of the labels for both men now pulled directly into the fight.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing in Bexar County alleges UMG engaged in \u201cirregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia. The petition, a precursor to a potential lawsuit, seeks depositions from corporate representatives of both companies.",
      "The filing takes aim at UMG for allegedly knowing that \u201cthe song itself, as well as its accompanying album art and music video, attacked the character of another one of UMG\u2019s most prominent artists, Drake, by falsely accusing him of being a sex offender, engaging in pedophilic acts, harboring sex offenders, and committing other criminal sexual acts.\u201d",
      "The filing points out that \"the song calls Drake a \u2018certified pedophile,\u2019 a \u2018predator,\u2019 and someone whose name should \u2018be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.\u2019\"",
      "The petition says Drake could sue UMG for defamation, among other claims.",
      "A UMG representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the new filing.

We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns.\"",

      "That changed when Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year.",

      "ATLANTA -- Deliberations are underway in Atlanta after a year of testimony in the gang and racketeering trial that originally included the rapper Young Thug.",
      "Jurors are considering whether to convict Shannon Stillwell and Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, on gang, murder, drug and gun charges. The original indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.",
      "Opening statements in the trial for six of those defendants happened a year ago. Four of them, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty last month. The rapper was freed on probation. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after more than a week of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",
      "Both seemed to be in good spirits Tuesday morning after closings wrapped the previous night. Kendrick was chatting and laughing with Stillwell and his lawyers before the jury arrived for instructions.",
      "The jury started deliberating Tuesday afternoon and was dismissed at 5 p.m. Jurors are expected to resume deliberations Wednesday morning. If they don\u2019t reach a verdict by 3 p.m. Wednesday, the judge will send them home for the Thanksgiving weekend and they will return Monday morning.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d in an Atlanta barbershop.",
      "Prosecutors painted Stillwell and Kendrick as members of a violent street gang called Young Slime Life, or YSL, co-founded in 2012 by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams. During closings on Monday, they pointed to tattoos, song lyrics and social media posts they said proved members, including Stillwell, admitted to killing people in rival gangs.",
      "Prosecutors say Thomas was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged in the 2022 killing of Shymel Drinks, which prosecutors said was in retaliation for the killing of two YSL associates days earlier.",
      "Defense attorneys Doug Weinstein and Max Schardt said the state presented unreliable witnesses, weak evidence and cherry-picked lyrics and social media posts to push a false narrative about Stillwell, Kendrick and the members of YSL.",
      "Schardt, Stillwell's attorney, reminded the jury that alleged YSL affiliates said during the trial that they had lied to police. Law enforcement played a \u201csick game\u201d by promising they would escape long prison sentences if they said what police wanted them to say, Schardt said. He theorized that one of those witnesses could have killed Thomas.",
      "The truth is that their clients were just trying to escape poverty through music, Schardt said.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",
      "Young Thug\u2019s record label is also known as YSL, an acronym of Young Stoner Life. Kendrick was featured on two popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\" and \u201cSlatty,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence in the trial.",
      "Weinstein, Kendrick\u2019s defense attorney, said during closings it was wrong for prosecutors to target the defendants for their music and lyrics. Prosecutor Simone Hylton disagreed, and said surveillance footage and phone evidence supported her case.",
      "\u201cThey have the audacity to think they can just brag about killing somebody and nobody\u2019s gonna hold them accountable,\u201d Hylton said.",
      "The trial had more than its fair share of delays. Jury selection took nearly 10 months, and Stillwell was stabbed last year at the Fulton County jail, which paused trial proceedings.",
      "Judge Paige Reese Whitaker took over after Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July because he had a meeting with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present.",
      "Whitaker often lost patience with prosecutors over moves such as not sharing evidence with defense attorneys, once accusing them of \u201cpoor lawyering.\u201d But the trial sped up under her watch.",
      "In October, four defendants, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty, with the rapper entering a non-negotiated or \u201cblind\u201d plea, meaning he didn't have a deal worked out with prosecutors.",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others are pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",

      "One of the first real signs that \u201cQueer\u201d is going to be an unconventional movie is when Daniel Craig in a linen suit saunters through Mexico City during the early \u201950s and the soundtrack blasts a song by Nirvana",
      "One of the first real signs that \u201cQueer\u201d is going to be an unconventional movie is when Daniel Craig in a linen suit saunters through Mexico City during the early '50s and the soundtrack blasts a song by Nirvana.",
      "It's a pretty nifty way to explain this story of a man unmoored by time, geography and himself. Craig plays William Lee, an American hiding out in Mexico who spends his time going from bar to bar, knocking back tequila or mescal.",
      "Why is he hiding out? For one thing, he's a junkie and Mexico is more permissive about heroin use than the States at this time. He's also gay when being gay was abhorrent and Mexico was, again, more permissive. Lee is part of a wealthy expat contingent that fritters away the days stewed in liquor and gossip.",
      "He doesn't just sound like a William S. Burroughs hero, he's partly Burroughs himself \u2014 \u201cQueer\u201d was a confessional novella written long before his breakthrough novel \u201cNaked Lunch.\u201d So buckle up. You're going to see some weird stuff.",
      "\u201cQueer\u201d is best when it's a character study of Lee, who in Craig's hands is charming, selfish, arrogant, abrasive, foppish and sometimes unable to read a room. It's a million miles from 007, even if Lee carries a pistol. Craig allows us to see the yearning for real love that Lee numbs with shot glasses and needles. That Nirvana song is \u201cCome as You Are.\u201d",
      "One day that real love suddenly appears in the form of the younger Eugene Allerton (a superb, icy Drew Starkey), who unlocks something in Lee. Could Eugene be the one to make Lee whole? Could they ride off into the sunset? Don't be silly. This is a Burroughs story.",
      "Eugene is on-again, off-again, sometimes loving Lee and sometimes preferring a woman's company. Part of Eugene seems to dislike Lee or being seen with him. Lee's voracious need \u2014 shown with vigorous lovemaking scenes \u2014 is overpowering.",
      "One scene has the two men walking down a street and Eugene subtly shakes off the older man's hand on his shoulder. \u201cIs he a queer?\u201d Lee asks a friend. \u201cI can't tell.\u201d One drunken night he approaches his source of adoration and confesses he wants to speak without speaking. He soon will try.",
      "Director Luca Guadagnino and screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, who teamed up for \"Challengers,\" face enormous challenges in adapting Burroughs's words to the screen and yet they manage it, lyrically.",
      "There is a single-take scene in which Lee assembles the equipment necessary to inject himself with heroin and the camera watches as he gets high, slowing his body down to become a sort of pathetic statue at the kitchen table.",
      "Symbols \u2014 a wriggling bug, snakes and mirrors \u2014 combine with trippy techniques meant to show Lee's interior life, like his arm superimposed onto a scene tenderly touching his paramour when, in reality, it is hanging still. And there is a late moment of surreal beauty as the lovers climb into each other\u2019s bodies, hands under the skin.",
      "\u201cQueer\u201d \u2014 broken up into three chapters and an epilogue \u2014 gets trippier in the later stages, when Lee and Eugene leave Mexico in search of a South American plant that apparently gives users telepathic powers. Lee is clearly trying to find a shortcut into the soul, bypassing the messiness of human interactions. \u201cYou think it can fix things for you,\u201d he is told.",
      "But this part isn't well integrated with the first half, almost like a movie fragment, and the filmmakers fumble an attempt to deal with the death of Burroughs' wife, Joan Vollmer. Guadagnino seems to unnecessarily channel Stanley Kubrick as the movie wobbles to its end, with scenes filled with deafening sound, then pregnant silence and an artificial momentousness.",
      "The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is vibrant but it gets a chef's kiss with the addition of songs by Prince, New Order and Lydia Mendoza, mixed with contemporary songs by Benny Goodman, Eddie Cantor, Frankie Lane and Cole Porter.",
      "The weight of it all comes down to Craig, and he's a wonder in a fedora, dirt stains on his linen pants. \u201cQueer\u201d is a reminder of how good an actor he is and how brave he can be \u2014 naked, needy and noxious. You'll be shaken and stirred.",
      "\u201cQueer,\u201d a A24 release that hits theaters Wednesday, is rated R for \u201cstrong sexual content, graphic nudity, strong drug content, language and brief violence.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Since exiting the role of James Bond, Daniel Craig has seemed eager to push himself in further directions",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Daniel Craig is sitting in the restaurant of the Carlyle Hotel talking about how easy it can be to close yourself off to new experiences.",
      "\u201cWe get older and maybe out of fear, we want to control the way we are in our lives. And I think it\u2019s sort of the enemy of art,\u201d Craig says. \u201cYou have to push against it. Whether you have success or not is irrelevant, but you have to try to push against it.\u201d",
      "Craig, relaxed and unshaven, has the look of someone who has freed himself of a too snug tuxedo. Part of the abiding tension of his tenure as James Bond was this evident wrestling with the constraints that came along with it. Any such strains, though, would seem now to be completely out the window.",
      "Since exiting that role, Craig, 56, has seemed eager to push himself in new directions. He performed \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Broadway. His drawling detective Benoit Blanc (\u201cHalle Berry!\u201d) stole the show in \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d And now, Craig gives arguably his most transformative performance as the William S. Burroughs avatar Lee in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s tender tale of love and longing in postwar Mexico City, \u201cQueer.\u201d",
      "Since the movie\u2019s Venice Film Festival premiere, it\u2019s been one of the fall\u2019s most talked about performances \u2014 for its explicit sex scenes, for its vulnerability and for its extremely un-007-ness.",
      "\u201cThe role, they say, must have been a challenge or \u2018You\u2019re so brave to do this,\u2019\u201d Craig said in a recent interview alongside Guadagnino. \u201cI kind of go, \u2018Eh, not really.\u2019 It\u2019s why I get up in the morning.\u201d",
      "In \u201cQueer,\u201d which A24 release Wednesday in theaters, Craig again plays a well-traveled, sharply dressed, cocktail-drinking man. But the similarities with his most famous role stop there. Lee is an American expat living in 1950s Mexico City where he, in sweaty, rumpled linen suits, cruises for younger men while juggling an increasingly debilitating drug habit. (No matter what you\u2019ve heard, the most truly unexpected sight in \u201cQueer\u201d is Daniel Craig as an awkward suitor.)",
      "Lee, though, is thunderstruck with infatuation for a poised and prim young man named Allerton (Drew Starkey). The film, adapted by \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, proceeds as a love story but also as a profound romantic mystery.",
      "Allerton is enigmatic and aloof, and it\u2019s unclear how much he\u2019s embraced his homosexuality. Their evolving relationship is a constant confusion to Lee. \u201cQueer\u201d becomes consumed not just with the question of their unsettled love, but of the tantalizing possibilities of liberation and the painful, long-term sacrifices of repression.",
      "The film, classically filmed on soundstages in Rome\u2019s Cinecitt\u00e0, is populated with expansive windows and doorways that seem to ask: What doors to yourself, or to life, are you willing to walk through?",
      "\u201cMaybe another portal is his open chest. He just goes, \u2018Please come in, come in,\u2019\u201d says Craig. \u201cIt applies to art. It applies to everything. Letting one's self go. If you don\u2019t do it, how can you ever know? That tragedy of not doing that is greater than the embarrassment of doing it. We\u2019re defined by those moments in our lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cQueer\u201d could be such a defining moment for Craig. For his performance, he\u2019s widely expected to land his first Oscar nomination. For Guadagnino, making \u201cQueer\u201d is especially long in coming. He first read the book \u2013 written in the early \u201850s but, by Burroughs\u2019 own wishes, not published until 1985 \u2013 when he was 17.",
      "For years, Guadagnino, the Italian filmmaker of \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d and \u201cChallengers,\u201d contemplated \u201cQueer\u201d as a movie; he even once drafted his own script. In Lee, he saw a poetic figure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really interested in the repression of others,\u201d Guadagnino says. \u201cI realize many, many times I go back to the theme. The idea of being so vulnerable and ready to be. He doesn\u2019t have a sense of pride or a protection of social codes.\u201d",
      "While they were making \u201cChallengers,\u201d released earlier this year, Guadagnino approached Kuritzkes about adapting Burroughs\u2019 novel. There were considerable hurdles. Burroughs never completely finished the novel, so the filmmakers resolved to finish it for him, writing into the movie an extended third-act ayahuasca trip. But adapting \u201cQueer\u201d also meant leaving room for its unspoken spaces.",
      "\u201cThere is so much in the movie that is about the way Lee looks at Allerton and the way Allerton looks at him, and looks away,\u201d says Kuritzkes. \u201cA lot of that stuff is in the book, but when you\u2019re making the movie, you realize the way Daniel\u2019s face registers Drew\u2019s face tells you what would be communicated in 15 pages of prose.\u201d",
      "Guadagnino, convinced Craig was right for the role, approached the actor with the script. In Craig, Guadagnino saw someone, he says, who was \u201copen to play.\u201d Within days, Craig, long an admirer of Guadagnino\u2019s films, was in.",
      "\u201cI just recognized so many things within him,\u201d Craig says. \u201cSomeone who is both repressed and open, and the complicated relationship with love.\u201d",
      "Though it inverts the presentation of masculinity many associate with Craig, Lee of \u201cQueer\u201d is more in line with some of the actor\u2019s earlier work, like 1998\u2019s \u201cLove Is the Devil.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting, too, that Craig's other major post-Bond movie role, Benoit Blanc, is also gay. (Hugh Grant plays his subtly suggested partner.)",
      "For \u201cQueer,\u201d there was extensive preparation, on accent and movement and Burroughs\u2019 own tortured history. But after months of research, the characterization only really emerged once shooting began.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how nervous I was. It was terrifying,\u201d Craig says. \u201cBut something clicked that day, the first day. And Luca said, \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019 I was very nervous to try to expose it, but it became a kind of unfolding of the character. I kind of introduced myself to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Daniel loves the camera in a way that is intimate,\u201d adds Guadagnino. \u201cBecause he knows the camera cannot lie and you can\u2019t lie to the camera. The love you feel from the camera, to me, is not the love of vanity. It\u2019s the love of recording the truth.\u201d",
      "Starkey, the 31-year-old \u201cOuter Banks\u201d actor, was met with the very different challenge of playing a character with few words on the page and a cryptic presence. He theorized that Allerton is in retreat because it\u2019s \u201cas if you\u2019ve lived your whole life and never seen your own reflection, and someone puts a mirror in front of your face.\u201d",
      "\u201cA question I asked early on was: Is Allerton aware of the game that he\u2019s playing? Is he aware that he may have some power over Lee, and does he like it?\u201d says Starkey. \u201cLuca\u2019s answer to that was: \u2018That\u2019s a very good question.\u2019\u201d",
      "When \u201cQueer\u201d premiered in Venice, much of the reception focused on the film\u2019s steamy sex scenes with Craig and Starkey. Guadagnino laments the temptation of the press to be \u201csalacious.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t help themselves,\u2019 he says. \u201cBut we are practical people. People make love. People laugh. People sleep. People inject heroin.\"",
      "\u201cOur job is only to make that as truthful as possible, and not shy away from it, not be coy about it,\u201d adds Craig.",
      "\u201cAnd can we just clear the table forever? When we were shooting the sex scenes it was so funny,\u201d says Guadagnino. \u201cWe had fun. It was fun, light and then, done, let\u2019s move on to the next.\u201d",
      "As intimately as Craig and Starkey would be working together, they decided to let their relationship unfold naturally.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t, like, grab coffee and have a list of ice-breakers or something,\u201d Starkey says. \u201cWe just started working. We jumped into movement rehearsals and that was a great way to learn how to be free with the other person. It never felt like there any walls up.\u201d",
      "Not having walls up was, in many ways, the abiding nature of \u201cQueer.\u201d And for Craig, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of his career. He and Guadagnino are already planning another film together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any grand plan for my career. It\u2019s been OK \u2019til now. It\u2019s been going along,\u201d Craig says, with a grin. \u201cThen something comes along like this and you find a group of people to have this wonderful experience with. It makes me go: I want to keep acting. I never wanted to give up, but if I could get this again, I\u2019d love to do it.\u201d"

      "Drake has begun legal action against Universal Music Group, alleging the company conspired to falsely pump up the popularity of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "Drake alleged in a court filing Monday that Universal Music Group falsely pumped up the popularity on Spotify and other streaming services of Kendrick Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us,\" a song that viciously attacked Drake amid a bitter feud between the two hip-hop superstars.",
      "The petition in a New York court by the rapper's company Frozen Moments LLC demands the preservation and divulgence of information that might be evidence in a potential lawsuit against UMG, which is the distributor for the record labels of both Drake and Lamar.",
      "In allegations that UMG calls \u201coffensive and untrue,\u201d the filing says the record company \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 in order to make that song go viral, including by using \u2018bots\u2019 and pay-to-play agreements.\u201d It said the company and Spotify \u201chave a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship\u201d and alleges that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.",
      "The petition also says UMG has fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \"in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\"",
      "Universal Music Group said in a statement in response that the \"suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May as part of a flurry of dueling tracks by the two artists, includes the lyrics, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young, You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d It has gotten more than 900 million plays, according to figures listed on Spotify.",
      "Spotify representatives declined immediate comment, but in a statement on a previous case, the company said it \u201cinvests heavily in automated and manual reviews to prevent, detect, and mitigate the impact of artificial streaming on our platform,\u201d and in broader public statements has said it has gone to great lengths to mitigate the effects of bad actors on streaming numbers and royalties.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre's biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year. The move to court, while not yet a lawsuit, still represents a major escalation of the feud and involves some of the biggest business partners of both men."

      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Colosseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint also was notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2014 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 also were higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2014 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2014 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film. In its second week of release, the Amazon MGM Studios release grossed $13.3 million to bring its two-week global haul to $117 million. At a cost of $250 million to make, \u201cRed One\u201d is the season's biggest flop, though it could recoup some value for Amazon if it's more popular once it begins streaming.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \"Wicked,\" $114 million.",
      "2. \u201cGladiator II,\u201d $55.5 million.",

      "\u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d is the debut story collection of the British author Naomi Wood",
      "Naomi Wood, an English author not yet well known in the U.S., has written three historical novels, including the well-regarded \u201cMrs. Hemingway,\u201d about the four wives of Ernest Hemingway. During the Covid lockdowns, when her kids were confined at home and she had less time to herself, she turned to the short story form. The result, \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d is an astonishingly good debut collection that often incorporates the bizarre, life-altering reality of the pandemic into the plots.",
      "The main characters tend to be 30-something women trying to have it all. Kids, relationships, satisfying careers \u2014 the \u201cseductive slipstream of productivity.\u201d They also strive to be good citizens of an ailing planet and have sex with their partners more than once in a blue moon.",
      "In \u201cComorbidities,\u201d which won the 2023 BBC National Short Story Award, a couple with young children tries to spice up their marriage by making a sex tape. In an abundance of caution, the man pauses the action to read up on digital security and adjust his devices. Hours later, when the glow has worn off, the woman has a panic attack, worrying it might somehow end up in the \u201cdeadly slime of the internet.\u201d",
      "Her female protagonists happen to be a lusty bunch, enjoying sex in flavors that some might consider kinky. But once the little ones arrive, everything changes. Fathers might leave, but these mothers wouldn\u2019t dream of it. \u201cThey\u2019re the grand love affair, in the end. The kids. No one else,\u201d says a character in the story \u201cA/A/A/A.\u201d",
      "But don\u2019t think for a minute that they\u2019re selfless or saintly. Feminism has freed them to enter the 21st century labor market and take on high-powered jobs, where they prove to be just as scheming, selfish and manipulative as the men.",
      "\u201cRecently, I had started to notice my bad energy, and I began to follow it, wondering where it would take me,\u201d says the main character in \u201cWedding Day.\u201d And where was that? To a scheme to disrupt her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wedding by insisting he leave the party early to bring their daughter home for her bedtime. But revenge is bittersweet because once he is back in the apartment they used to share, she is overcome with painful memories of their powerful erotic attraction.",
      "For all their flaws \u2014 and they have lots of them \u2014 the women in these delectable stories are insanely fun to be with because they are so fully imagined and true to the way we live now.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new stage musical about Louis Armstrong on Broadway opens with the jazz icon in a rehearsal room alongside an anonymous piano player. Keep an eye on the guy on keys.",
      "Audiences may not know it, but there are actually two Armstrongs onstage at that moment \u2014 the actor playing the great trumpeter and one of his real-life descendants. In an act of casting kismet, the piano player is Brandon Louis Armstrong, the music giant's great-great nephew.",
      "\u201cThat moment always feels like I get to \u2014 as Brandon \u2014 speak to my great-great uncle from beyond,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to just spend a moment in conversation with him and ask if he\u2019s OK and hear his voice.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong is making his Broadway debut in \u201cA Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical,\u201d playing multiple parts, including a piano player, a teacher and as an understudy for Louis Armstrong himself.",
      "\u201cI was cautious about how I\u2019d be able to step into this world and connect with part of my family history and my lineage,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful and so thankful and so happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\u201d \u2014 starring Tony Award-winner James Monroe Iglehart and sometimes James T. Lane in the title role \u2014 is a stage bio of one of jazz's most influential figures, a musician know for \u201cHello, Dolly,\u201d \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d and \u201cA Wonderful World.\u201d",
      "The musical looks behind his wide smile to dig into his rise from poverty, his four marriages and battles with racism from the Klansmen of New Orleans to the thugs of Chicago to Hollywood\u2019s bigots. He emerges from it a transcendent force, warts and all.",
      "\u201cThe messaging behind it is that jazz is the choices that we make in between the notes,\u201d says the younger Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making the right choice every time. It\u2019s about making a choice and allowing yourself to be present wherever those choices may lead you.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong was born and raised in Los Angeles. His home was always filled with music, but no one in his immediate family is a musician or wanted to perform.",
      "\u201cI grew up with a lot of jazz playing in the household, a lot of gospel, a lot of R&B, a lot of hip-hop. My mom was also really big into like '80s hair metal bands and stuff like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d go from listening to Motown to like listening to Guns n' Roses and then Kenny Rogers. It just was always a tapestry of music.\u201d",
      "He was enchanted by his high school show choir and got invited to join \u2014 all boys got in because muscles were needed to lift the girls \u2014 and was later stunned by seeing a regional theater production of the classic musical \u201cRagtime.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so moved by it, I just was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m the person sweeping the floors when it\u2019s over. I just want to be a part of whatever that is\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "He graduated from The American Musical and Dramatic Academy and after some local stage work \u2014 including playing Donkey in \u201cShrek\u201d \u2014 landed on the third national tour of \u201cHamilton,\u201d which kicked off in 2019 in Puerto Rico starring Lin-Manuel Miranda.",
      "Armstrong didn't lean into his family name to get ahead. Press interviews when he broke out didn't even mention his famous pedigree. \u201cI never, surprisingly, thought to ever lead with that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this particular show, it's inescapable.\u201d",
      "Iglehart, also a co-director, recalls Armstrong walking into the rehearsal room and stating his name. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018How cool.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m related.\u2019\u201d He got the job based on his voice and acting \u2014 not his name.",
      "\u201cWe really did it on talent,\u201d says Iglehart. \u201cI always feel like who's ever the most talented person for the show, that should be who is in it. But then the fact that it was his lineage, we kind of felt that it was like a sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\" has been a way to honor not only Louis Armstrong but also Brandon's grandfather, Louis Henry Armstrong, who told stories about his proud lineage and would often pick Brandon up after school blasting jazz music, much to his teenage embarrassment.",
      "\u201cI just think in those moments how unbelievably proud he would be of something like this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the best kind of therapy every night.\u201d",
      "While there is an actual Armstrong in the cast, fellow actors and creatives haven't pulled Brandon aside to ask him about what Louis would think about a line or a scene. That's because Louis Armstrong left many rich writings about his thoughts.",
      "\u201cSo much of the heartbeat of what it is that our show is beating with \u2014 and I prefer it this way \u2014 is the heartbeat that\u2019s being told through Louis\u2019 voice, as opposed to someone coming in and arbitrarily putting themselves into him,\" the younger Armstrong said.",
      "In addition to the rehearsal piano player, serving in the ensemble and playing the New Orleans music teacher who recognized Louis Armstrong's talent, Brandon knows that one day he will be asked to go on as his great-great uncle.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern I think when it happens is just trying not to cry all the way through the show,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cSomehow the universe has paved out this road for me that has landed me here, getting to literally take the stage and carry that baton.\"",

      "\u201cDead Air: The Night that Orson Welles Terrified America\u201d by William Elliott Hazelgrove is a history of the 1938 radio adaptation of \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d",
      "Long before Donald Trump used the term \u201cfake news\u201d to complain about coverage he didn't like, Orson Welles mastered the art of actual fake news.",
      "Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d is the focus of William Elliott Hazelgrove's \u201cDead Air: The Night That Orson Welles Terrified America.\u201d",
      "The book serves as an enjoyable history of the radio drama, with a fair share of fascinating details about its production and historical context. But it falls short on exploring the legendary reports of mass hysteria among listeners who believed they were hearing an actual Martian invasion unfold.",
      "In appropriately cinematic detail, Hazelgrove chronicles Welles' rise and manic working style \u2014 even including a hilarious account of a scuffle that broke out between Welles and Ernest Hemingway and ended with the pair toasting each other over whiskey.",
      "The book highlights what made Welles' production particularly powerful, airing at a time when millions remained unemployed from the Great Depression and the nation was on edge about the threat of Nazi Germany. He details how Welles took advantage of those fears, including using an actor who sounded like Franklin D. Roosevelt for a part in his broadcast.",
      "\u201cA bottled-up sense of panic was in the air and people could almost smell the fear,\" he writes. \u201cOrson Welles would open that bottle and let the fear run wild.\u201d",
      "The book's biggest flaw is Hazelgrove's exploration of just how wild that fear ran. Hazelgrove too easily dismisses the modern reappraisal that reports of a widespread panic were exaggerated, and shows little skepticism about news accounts from then that were largely based on anecdotal reports.",
      "Hazelgrove also makes an unconvincing argument that there were deaths that can be attributed to the panic over the broadcast. He even stretches to speculate that a car accident reported on the night of the broadcast could have been related without any evidence to back that up.",
      "There' no doubt that Welles' drama had a major impact on pop culture, and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d will have an enduring legacy. Hazelgrove's book misses an opportunity to fully revisit the reports of the panic it caused.",

      "According to the website, Shen Yun, along with Fei Tian Academy of the Arts and Fei Tian College \u2014 which were also named as defendants \u2014 were founded by followers of the Falun Gong faith.",

      "The lawsuit said she contracted measles when she was 14 but was not permitted to see a doctor. Instead, the lawsuit said, she was told to meditate to feel better and was required to work while she recovered.",
      "Chang was terminated from Shen Yun in 2020 when she was 24 years old and was returned to Taiwan, where she was diagnosed with clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit."

      "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit",
      "BERLIN -- Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin's \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit, in her memoirs published Tuesday.",
      "Merkel, 70, appears to have no significant doubts about the major decisions of her 16 years as German leader, whose major challenges included the global financial crisis, Europe\u2019s debt crisis, the 2015-16 influx of refugees and the COVID-19 pandemic. True to form, her book \u2014 titled \u201cFreedom\u201d \u2014 offers a matter-of-fact account of her early life in communist East Germany and her later career in politics, laced with moments of dry wit.",
      "Merkel served alongside four U.S. presidents, four French presidents and five British prime ministers. But it is perhaps her dealings with Russian President Putin that have drawn the most scrutiny since she left office in late 2021.",
      "Merkel recalls being kept waiting by Putin at the Group of Eight summit she hosted in 2007 \u2014 \u201cif there's one thing I can't stand, it's unpunctuality.\u201d And she recounts a visit to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that year in which Putin's labrador appeared during a photo opportunity, although Putin knew she was afraid of dogs.",
      "Putin appeared to enjoy the situation, she writes, and she didn't bring it up \u2014 keeping as she often did to the motto \u201cnever explain, never complain.\u201d",
      "The previous year, she recounts Putin pointing to wooden houses in Siberia and telling her poor people lived there who \u201ccould be easily seduced,\u201d and that similar groups had been encouraged by money from the U.S. government to take part in Ukraine's \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d of 2004 against attempted election fraud. Putin, she says, added: \u201cI will never allow something like that in Russia.\u201d",
      "Merkel says she was irritated by Putin's \u201cself-righteousness\u201d in a 2007 speech in Munich in which he turned away from earlier attempts to develop closer ties with the U.S. She said that appearance showed Putin as she knew him, \u201cas someone who was always on guard against being treated badly and ready to give out at any time, including power games with a dog and making other people wait for him.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne could find this all childish and reprehensible, one could shake one's head over it \u2014 but that didn't make Russia disappear from the map,\u201d she writes.",
      "As she has before, Merkel defends a much-criticized 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine that she helped broker and her government's decisions to buy large quantities of natural gas from Russia. And she argues it was right to keep up diplomatic and trade ties with Moscow until she left power,",
      "Merkel concluded after first meeting then-Sen. Obama in 2008 that they could work well together. More than eight years later, during his last visit as president in Nov. 2016, she was one of the people with whom she discussed whether to seek a fourth term.",
      "Obama, she says, asked questions but held back with an opinion, and that in itself was helpful. He \u201csaid that Europe could still use me very well, but I should ultimately follow my feelings,\u201d she writes.",
      "There was no such warmth with Trump, who had criticized Merkel and Germany in his 2016 campaign. Merkel says she had to seek an \u201cadequate relationship ... without reacting to all the provocations.\u201d",
      "In March 2017, there was an awkward moment when Merkel first visited the Trump White House. Photographers shouted \u201chandshake!\u201d and Merkel quietly asked Trump: \u201cDo you want to have a handshake?\u201d There was no response from Trump, who looked ahead with his hands clasped.",
      "Merkel faults her own reaction. \u201cHe wanted to create a topic of discussion with his behavior, while I had acted as if I were dealing with an interlocutor behaving normally,\u201d she writes. She adds that Putin apparently \u201cfascinated\u201d Trump and, in the following years, she had the impression that \u201cpoliticians with autocratic and dictatorial traits\u201d beguiled him.",
      "Merkel says she tried to help then-Prime Minister David Cameron in the European Union as he faced pressure from British Euroskeptics, but there were limits to what she could do. And, pointing to Cameron's efforts over the years to assuage opponents of the EU, she says the road to Brexit is a textbook example of what can arise from a miscalculation.",
      "After Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, an outcome she calls a \u201chumiliation\u201d for its other members, she says the question of whether she should have made more concessions to the U.K. \u201ctortured me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI came to the conclusion that, in view of the political developments inside the country at the time, there would have been no acceptable possibility for me to prevent Britain's way out of the European Union from outside,\u201d Merkel says.",
      "Merkel was the first German chancellor to leave power at a time of her choosing. She announced in 2018 that she wouldn't seek a fifth term, and says she \u201clet go at the right point.\u201d",
      "She points to three 2019 incidents in which her body shook during public engagements as proof. Merkel says she had herself checked thoroughly and there were no neurological or other findings. An osteopath told her that her body was letting off the tension it had accumulated over years, she adds.",
      "\u201cFreedom\u201d runs to more than 700 pages in its original German edition, published by Kiepenheuer & Witsch. The English edition is being released simultaneously by St. Martin's Press."

      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

      "The detection of bird flu virus this week in a batch of unpasteurized milk sold in California underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks of the products",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the nation's top health job, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk across America. But the detection of bird flu virus in unpasteurized milk sold in California stores underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume that raw milk, unpasteurized milk, has potential infectious agents that can cause serious illness in the people who drink it,\" said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher who has investigated foodborne illness outbreaks.",
      "Raw Farm LLC, of Fresno, California, voluntarily recalled one lot of \u201ccream top\u201d whole raw milk after Santa Clara County health officials found the bird flu virus in a sample last week. State health officials said the county has been testing raw milk sold in stores as \u201ca second line of consumer protection.\u201d",
      "No illnesses have been traced to Raw Farm products, which have a lot code of 20241109 and a best-by date of Nov. 27. But officials with California's health department warned consumers not to drink the milk and said retailers should remove it from their shelves. On Tuesday, Los Angeles County health officials warned that \u201cmany retailers\u201d there may have sold recalled raw milk contaminated with the virus.",
      "Here's what else you need to know about raw milk and bird flu:",
      "It\u2019s not a surprise that the virus was found in raw milk sold in stores, Osterholm said.",
      "Bird flu, also known as Type A H5N1 influenza, was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March and has been spreading widely. In California, more than 435 dairy herds have seen infections \u2014 more than all other U.S. states combined. And high levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows.",
      "About 20% of samples of pasteurized milk sold in stores were found to contain viral remnants of the virus, according to tests conducted earlier this year by government scientists. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the bird flu virus and also bacteria such as E. coli, listeria and salmonella, which are known to make people sick.",
      "Officials with California's Department of Food and Agriculture have been conducting weekly tests of raw milk in bulk tanks from the state's dairies. Additional tests conducted at Raw Farm sites in California were negative for the virus, but officials said they would begin testing for bird flu twice a week.",
      "Few tests of unpasteurized milk products from stores have been conducted, so it's possible that other raw dairy products may contain the virus, Osterholm said.",
      "\u201cIt is still really unclear how much testing is going on,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe're flying blind.\u201d",
      "To date, there's no evidence that people have been infected with the bird flu virus by drinking raw milk. At least 55 people in the U.S. are known to have been infected by the virus this year, but nearly all were dairy or poultry workers who developed mild illness after close contact with infected animals.",
      "Tests have shown that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu became very sick and barn cats on farms that drank milk from infected cows suffered brain damage and died, noted Nicole Martin, a microbiologist and associate director of the Milk Quality Improvement Program at Cornell University,",
      "\u201cI don't think we know yet whether people can contract H5N1 from consumption of raw milk, but we have enough evidence that would suggest that folks need to be a little more cautious right now,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Nearly 4.4% of U.S. adults, or about 11 million people, report that they drink raw milk at least once each year. About 1% of adults say they consume raw milk each week, according to a 2022 FDA study.",
      "Proponents of raw milk cite perceived health benefits and better taste as key reasons for consumption. Raw Farm advertises its products as \u201cunprocessed and complete\u201d with vitamins, minerals, enzymes and beneficial bacteria.",

      "Nebraska has moved closer to allowing medical marijuana",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Three weeks after Nebraska voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana the state moved a step closer to allowing it Tuesday when a judge ruled that the petitions that put the question on the ballot were valid.",
      "The decision by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong was a victory for advocates of medical marijuana, but opponents are likely to appeal it to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTo prevail in this action, the plaintiff and Secretary had to show that more than 3,463 signatures on the Legalization Petition and 3,357 signatures on the Regulatory Petition are invalid. The Plaintiff and Secretary are well short,\u201d Strong wrote. Fewer than 1,000 signatures on each petition were shown to be invalid.",
      "A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general said the office\u2019s lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering whether to file an appeal.",
      "Medical marijuana supporters didn't immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday after the ruling was released.",
      "More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalization at the polls Nov. 5. The results are scheduled to be certified Dec. 2.",
      "Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers argued that problems with the way thousands of signatures were gathered meant the ballot initiatives shouldn\u2019t have been put to voters. One person who circulated petitions in Grand Island was criminally charged with falsifying at least 164 signatures. Evnen, Hilgers and former state Sen. John Kuehn also raised questions about whether other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana argued in court that even if some of the signatures gathered were flawed, the group still had well over the 86,499 needed. The Secretary of State's office certified nearly 90,000 signatures on both the petition to allow marijuana for medical use and the one to set up a commission to regulate it.",
      "The judge agreed that the state wasn't able to show any widespread fraud. Instead the ruling pointed primarily to the one petition circulator who was charged and raised questions about whether some other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Strong said she reviewed thousands of messages that top two organizers of the petition campaign exchanged that filled more than 800 pages and only found one mention of notarizing petitions outside of the petition circulator's presence.",
      "This year marked the third time Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana tried to get the issue on the ballot and the first time it made it there.",
      "In 2020, the group came close after meeting signature requirements. But opponents sued, arguing that advocates violated state rules requiring ballot measures to focus on a single question. Instead, the measure posed two separate questions: whether residents should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes, and whether private companies should be allowed to grow and sell it.",
      "The state Supreme Court prevented the questions from going to voters.",
      "In 2022, organizers failed to collect enough signatures in time to get the question on the November ballot.",
      "Voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida all rejected measures to legalize recreational marijuana use this year. But dozens of states have previously legalized it for either medical or recreational use, most recently in Ohio last year. In May, the federal government also began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug."

      "Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $35 billion proposal from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $ 35 billion proposal  from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The rule, unveiled Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department, would require Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound for a large segment of Americans who are obese.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal, which would not go into effect until after Trump takes office, will have support from his new administration \u2014 including from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an opponent of the drugs whom the president-elect has tapped to serve as head of HHS.",
      "Here's what to know about the drugs and the Biden administration's proposal:",
      "The weight-loss drugs, also called anti-obesity medications or GLP-1s, mimic the hormone known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The drugs include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro.",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But a slice of \u201cnonresponders\u201d did not lose significant body weight.",
      "Private health insurers have limited coverage of the drugs. Medicare has been barred from covering them under a law that says the program cannot pay for weight-loss products. Coverage through Medicaid, meanwhile, has varied from state to state.",
      "That's meant the drugs \u2014 which can cost upwards of $1,000 monthly \u2014 have been largely unaffordable for many.",
      "The rule announced Tuesday affects Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for roughly 70 million of the nation\u2019s poorest people, and Medicare, the health insurance program for about 67 million older Americans.",
      "Under the proposal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, would reinterpret the federal law, to consider the drugs as a treatment for obesity diseases.",
      "The nation's top health agency estimates as many as 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "And the proposal would cost a lot of money \u2014 at least $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "The drugs are popular \u2014 with a majority of Americans telling health firm KFF in a poll earlier this year that Medicare should cover the drugs. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, too, has lobbied for coverage of the drugs.",
      "But support is mixed in Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Kennedy has railed against the idea of Medicare or Medicaid covering the drugs. Instead, he's told Congress that they should expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships through the government-sponsored health care programs.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is poised to take the helm of CMS, has said the drugs can be a helpful tool. In a video posted to Instagram last year, Oz praised some of the benefits of the drugs, but said the long-term effects should be further studied.",
      "\u201cI think these new generation of medications offer us a huge opportunity,\u201d Oz said.",
      "Trump or Kennedy could ultimately ignore Biden's proposal and not implement it.",
      "Some lawmakers praised the move on Tuesday, while others expressed skepticism.",
      "Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican who sponsored a bill to have Medicare cover the weight-loss drugs, has argued that covering the drugs and other obesity treatments could save taxpayers in the long run.",
      "\u201cI am encouraged to see the Administration support our efforts to help make Americans healthier by allowing Medicare coverage of new, physician prescribed and FDA approved anti-obesity medications,\" Wenstrup said in a statement.",
      "He called for the Congress to pass a law that would help pay for dietitians, nutritionists and behavioral therapy to treat obesity.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, warned that unless the government required drugmakers to lower the price of the medications Medicare premiums would \u201cskyrocket\" under the plan.",
      "It's good for more Americans to have access to these drugs, which have proven effective, but Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition and obesity expert at Harvard University, hopes that it doesn't become the primary way obesity is treated in America.",
      "He worries that not enough investment is being made to figure out what is driving climbing obesity rates across the U.S., and the role that healthy foods and exercise might play in solving that epidemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to treat the problems that we now face with drugs, but let\u2019s not stop there,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cLet\u2019s identify what\u2019s causing the problem, and ultimately rely on these drugs \u2014 which have side effects \u2014 less and less over time.\u201d",
      "Dr. Andrew Kraftson, who treats obese patients at the University of Michigan, is happy that more of his patients might be able to afford these drugs, which he has prescribed for patients and has had successful results. But he, too, would like to see more research and guidance from the government on prescribing the medications.",
      "Kraftson also worries about some of the side effects for elderly patients. The drugs, he points out, can lead to muscle loss, which is a bigger problem for older Americans who are at risk of falling, for example.",
      "\u201cI'm advocating for their thoughtful use,\u201d Kraftson said. \"Because if you have a senior and you just write a prescription and the visit takes five minutes, is that an appropriate level of care? Have we defined that well?",

      "The settlement stems from a lawsuit the Justice Department filed earlier this year that said Maine unnecessarily segregates children with behavioral health disabilities in institutions. Investigators said at the time that the state's actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the children's right not to be confined away from their families.",
      "The Justice Department said the settlement requires Maine to make changes that help children remain with families or foster families and avoid emergency department stays and institutions. The department said the changes must also help children move out of institutions and instead receive services at home.",
      "Maine Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement that her administration and the Maine Legislature have invested $260 million on improvements to children's behavioral health services. The total number of Maine children in residential treatment has lowered from 290 to 192 for in-state care and 250 to 69 for out-of-state care, she said."

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky's attorney general has expanded an opioid-related lawsuit to target another big pharmacy benefit manager that he claims contributed to the state's deadly addiction crisis.",
      "OptumRx has been added as a new defendant in the suit that was filed two months ago, Attorney General Russell Coleman said Tuesday. His claims against Optum and its affiliated organizations are similar to those initially made against Express Scripts, which remains a defendant in the case.",
      "The Republican attorney general accused Optum of playing a central role in what he called the reckless promotion, dispensing and oversupply of opioids. OptumRx controls a pharmacy network consisting of about 67,000 retail pharmacy locations nationwide, the suit said.",
      "Kentucky was ravaged by the addiction crisis, resulting in some of the nation\u2019s highest overdose death rates.",
      "\u201cThese groups pushed a profit-fueled agenda at the expense of Kentucky families, who are left with empty seats at the dinner table,\u201d Coleman said in a release.",
      "Optum did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. When it was sued in September, Express Scripts responded that it has long worked to combat opioid overuse and abuse and would \u201cvigorously contest these baseless allegations in court.\u201d",
      "Coleman initially filed the legal action in a state court, but the two sides are wrangling over whether it should be in state or federal court, his office said. He wants the case heard in state court.",
      "Coleman has accused the defendants of using deceptive marketing to boost sales of highly addictive drugs. They also dispensed opioids through mail-order pharmacies without effective controls in violation of Kentucky and federal law, he said.",
      "He is seeking, among other things, civil penalties for each willful violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, plus any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.",
      "\u201cDefendants have hidden their conduct through non-transparent business practices and by requiring each entity with whom they conduct business, such as opioid manufacturers, to enter into confidentiality agreements or otherwise keep their agreements confidential,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, run prescription drug coverage for health insurers and employers that provide coverage. They help decide which drugs make a plan\u2019s formulary, or list of covered medications. They also can determine where patients go to fill their prescriptions.",
      "PBMs have drawn the ire of politicians, patients and others for years. PBMs say they play an important role in controlling drug costs and pass along most of the discounts they negotiate to their clients.",
      "Government lawsuits against pharmacy benefit managers are the latest frontier \u2013 and maybe the last big one \u2013 in years of litigation over the opioid-related drug epidemic in the U.S.",
      "Drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacy chains have already faced stacks of lawsuits and settled many of them, with most of the money required to be used to fight the overdose and addiction crisis.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. A decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight annual decline, but state leaders say fatalities remain tragically high and the fight against the drug epidemic is far from over. Nearly 2,000 Kentuckians died last year from drug overdoses."

      "The legislation passed 102 votes in favor to 13 against. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.",

      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",

      "\u201cWe need to continue to do our global work at CDC to make sure we are stopping outbreaks at their source,\u201d Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. \u201cWe need to keep that funding up. We need to keep the expertise up. We need to keep the diplomacy up.\u201d",
      "Cohen, 46, will be leaving office in January after about 18 months in the job. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday night said he picked Dave Weldon, a former Congressman from Florida, to be the agency\u2019s next chief.",
      "Cohen said she hasn\u2019t met Weldon and doesn\u2019t know him. She previously voiced concern about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaccine advocate and CDC critic nominated to oversee all federal public health agencies.",
      "The CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. The staff is heavy with scientists \u2014 60% have master\u2019s degrees or doctorates.",
      "The last eight years have been perhaps the most difficult in the agency's history. The CDC once enjoyed a sterling international reputation for its expertise on infectious diseases and other causes of illness and death. But trust in the agency fell because of missteps during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, political attacks and resistance to infection-prevention measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has four political appointees, out of about 13,000 employees. The rest serve no matter who is in the White House, with civil service protections against efforts to fire them for political reasons.",
      "Trump said during the campaign that he wants to convert many federal agency positions into political appointments, meaning those employees could be hired and fired by whoever wins the election.",
      "There\u2019s also a proposal to split the agency in two: one to track disease data, and another focused on public health but with a limited ability to make policy recommendations.",
      "And then there\u2019s a current budget proposal in Congress that would cut the agency\u2019s funding by 22%. It would also eliminate the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses, suicides and and shooting deaths.",
      "Cohen said there\u2019s reason to be proud of the agency\u2019s work in recent years. The CDC has built partnerships to improve the availability of testing for different infections and to watch for signs of disease outbreaks by monitoring wastewater. There are emerging threats, as always, but no new, full-fledged public health emergencies, she said.",
      "The day after the Nov. 5 election, Cohen emailed CDC employees to urge them to keep going.",
      "\u201cWhile the world may feel different with changes ahead \u2014 our mission has not changed,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She said she\u2019s not aware of any wave of worried CDC scientists heading for the doors because of the election results.",
      "\u201cThere is a difference between campaigning and governing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to go into this in a way that we\u2019re passing the baton.\u201d",
      "Cohen said she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do next, other than spend time with her family in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her family maintained its residence while she ran the agency.",
      "Next year, for the first time, the CDC director will be subject to Senate confirmation, which could make for a gap before Trump's pick takes the helm. CDC Deputy Director Dr. Debra Houry has been assigned to help manage the transition.",
      "Aside from administration transition, the CDC has to face several looming threats.",
      "Officials this month confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "There\u2019s also the ongoing stream of bird flu cases, most of them mild illnesses seen in farmworkers who were in direct contact with infected cows or chickens. CDC officials say they believe the risk to the public remains low and that there\u2019s no evidence it\u2019s been spreading between people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re yet at a turning place. But does that mean it couldn\u2019t change tomorrow? It could,\u201d she said.",

      "There\u2019s no place like home for the holidays",
      "NEW YORK -- There's no place like home for the holidays. And that may not necessarily be a good thing.",
      "In the wake of the very contentious and divisive 2024 presidential election, the upcoming celebration of Thanksgiving and the ramp-up of the winter holiday season could be a boon for some \u2014 a respite from the events of the larger world in the gathering of family and loved ones. Hours and even days spent with people who have played the largest roles in our lives. Another chapter in a lifetime of memories.",
      "That's one scenario.",
      "For others, that same period \u2014 particularly because of the polarizing presidential campaign \u2014 is something to dread. There is the likelihood of disagreements, harsh words, hurt feelings and raised voices looming large.",
      "Those who make a study of people and their relationships to each other in an increasingly complex 21st-century say there are choices that those with potentially fraught personal situations can make \u2014 things to do and things to avoid \u2014 that could help them and their families get through this time with a minimum of open conflict and a chance at getting to the point of the holidays in the first place.",
      "For those who feel strongly about the election's outcome, and know that the people they would be spending the holiday feel just as strongly in the other direction, take the time to honestly assess if you're ready to spend time together in THIS moment, barely a few weeks after Election Day \u2014 and a time when feelings are still running high.",
      "The answer might be that you're not, and it might be better to take a temporary break, says Justin Jones-Fosu, author of \u201cI Respectfully Disagree: How to Have Difficult Conversations in a Divided World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to assess your own readiness,\u201d he says, \u201cEach person is going be very different in this.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that it's not about taking a permanent step back. \u201cRight now is that moment that we\u2019re talking about because it\u2019s still so fresh. Christmas may be different.\u201d",
      "Keep focused on why why you decided to go in the first place, Jones-Fosu says. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s a relative there you don\u2019t get to see often, or a loved one is getting up in age, or your kids want to see their cousins. Keeping that reason in mind could help you get through the time.",
      "If you decide getting together is the way to go, but you know politics is still a dicey subject, set a goal of making the holiday a politics-free zone and stick with it, says Karl Pillemer, a professor at Cornell University whose work includes research on family estrangement.",
      "\u201cWill a political conversation change anyone\u2019s mind?\" he says. \u201cIf there is no possibility of changing anyone\u2019s mind, then create a demilitarized zone and don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
      "Let\u2019s be honest. Sometimes, despite best efforts and intentions to keep the holiday gathering politics- and drama-free, there\u2019s someone who\u2019s got something to say and is going to say it.",
      "In that case, avoid getting drawn into it, says Tracy Hutchinson, a professor in the graduate clinical mental health counseling program at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "\u201cNot to take the hook is one of the most important things, and it is challenging,\u201d she says. After all, you don\u2019t have to go to every argument you\u2019re invited to.",
      "If you risk getting caught up in the moment, consider engaging in what Pillemer calls \u201cforward mapping.\u201d This involves thinking medium and long term rather than just about right now \u2014 strategy rather than tactics. Maybe imagine yourself six months from now looking back on the dinner and thinking about the memories you'd want to have.",
      "\u201cThink about how you would like to remember this holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to remember it with your brother and sister-in-law storming out and going home because you\u2019ve had a two-hour argument?\u201d",
      "Things getting intense? Defuse the situation. Walk away. And it doesn't have to be in a huff. Sometimes a calm and collected time out is just what you \u2014 and the family \u2014 might need.",
      "Says Hutchinson: \u201cIf they do start to do something like that, you could say, `I\u2019ve got to make this phone call. I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m going to take a walk around the block.'\""

      "Food safety experts say safely serving a holiday feast takes planning and know-how",
      "Ready or not, the holidays are here. It's a time when many Americans accustomed to preparing simple meals find themselves responsible for safely serving multi-dish feasts.",
      "It's no easy task. Outbreaks of some types of food poisoning tend to rise in November and December, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tainted turkey, undercooked stuffing and germ-laced gravy from holiday buffets have all led to past illnesses \u2014 and even deaths \u2014 CDC investigators have found.",
      "It can be tricky for occasional cooks to prepare big meals in a way that avoids the common hazards that can make people sick, said Donald Schaffner, a food science expert at Rutgers University.",
      "\u201cCooking takes longer with big masses of food. Cooling takes longer with big masses of food,\u201d said Schaffner, who co-hosts the food-safety podcast \u201cRisky or Not?\u201d",
      "Together with podcast co-host Benjamin Chapman, a food scientist at North Carolina State University, Schaffner outlined common ways to keep holiday meals both festive and safe.",
      "Nearly 90% of U.S. hosts plan to serve turkey on Thanksgiving this year, according to the turkey producer Butterball.",
      "But raw turkey can harbor illness-causing bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and other germs. It must be handled safely to prevent those bugs from contaminating refrigerator surfaces, sinks and kitchen counters.",
      "A frozen bird must be thawed first. There are several accepted methods, including in the refrigerator, in the microwave or in cold running water, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cAll of these methods pose risks,\u201d he cautioned.",
      "A frozen turkey needs about 24 hours for every 4 to 5 pounds of weight to thaw in a refrigerator, according to the Agriculture Department. If you use a microwave or the cold water method, the bird must be cooked immediately. For details about safe turkey handling, check out the thawing and cooking calculators created by the USDA.",
      "And don\u2019t wash the turkey. It\u2019s a bad idea to rinse it in the sink, even though many cooks still insist on the practice, often out of habit, said Chapman.",
      "\u201cAnything that hits that surface and generates spray is going to basically spread contamination around your kitchen,\u201d he said.",
      "Instead, pat the turkey dry with paper towels and toss them, or use a kitchen towel and disinfect it in the laundry.",
      "Turkey needs to reach a cooked temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before serving. The best way to tell if it\u2019s cooked is to use a tip-sensitive digital thermometer inserted in the innermost section of the thigh, not touching the bone.",
      "Don\u2019t rely on the plastic pop-up thermometers stuck in some commercial turkeys. Chapman\u2019s past research shows that those buttons can activate well before the bird is actually done.",
      "At the same time, don\u2019t determine doneness by relying on signs such as golden-brown skin, whether the meat is no longer pink or whether the juices run clear.",
      "\u201cNone of those are great indicators of temperature,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "How you handle the rest of the meal \u2014 mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans or yams \u2014 is just as important as the main dish. It\u2019s crucial to avoid the so-called danger zone of temperatures between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where bacteria can easily grow.",
      "The key is to keep hot foods piping hot and cold foods cold \u2014 and to refrigerate everything promptly, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cThe recommendation is that you get those leftovers into the refrigerator within two hours of when they came off of the stove,\u201d he said.",
      "Make sure to refrigerate dense foods like sliced turkey, cooked sweet potatoes or gravy in shallow containers to help them cool down fast. Schaffner\u2019s recent research showed that foods cooled in containers at a depth of no more than 2 inches posed little risk of growing dangerous germs.",
      "One key way to avoid food poisoning is through scrupulous cleaning in the kitchen.",
      "Wash your hands before preparing food and after touching raw poultry. Use separate cutting boards, knives and other utensils when handling raw meat and fresh foods such as vegetables and salads.",
      "Pay close attention to any surface that may be contaminated. It\u2019s important to clean first with soap and water and then sanitize with a disinfectant \u2014 a two-step process.",

      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft. It's not as timely as rideshare; Johnston said she's had to wait up to 45 minutes \u2014 even after scheduling it at least 24 hours in advance.",
      "\u201cIt makes me mad because hey, I have things I have to do,\u201d she said.",
      "In recent years, 36 transportation programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C., have bolstered paratransit offerings with Uzurv, a rideshare company that specializes in door-to-door service for people with disabilities. The company says it immediately bans drivers who discriminate against disabled riders.",
      "Portland, Oregon, lost a third of its cab fleet because of a drop in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after, TriMet, the city\u2019s public transit operation, signed a contract with Uzurv.",
      "It's been an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution that Eileen Collins Turvey, TriMet's director of accessibility programs, is satisfied with \u2014 so much so that she hopes to make it an on-demand service next year.",
      "But first, she wants to be able to expand all paratransit contractors\u2019 ability to serve wheelchair users.",
      "\u201cWe need to get beyond the floor of the ADA,\u201d she said.",

      "Extreme weather is making power outages longer and more frequent across the U.S. People with health conditions who depend on medical devices powered by electricity are particularly vulnerable",
      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "An officer at Vang Vieng's Tourism Police office, who refused to give his name, told The Associated Press on Friday that a \u201cnumber of people\u201d had been detained in the case but that no charges have yet been filed. Staff at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, which was still operating but not accepting new guests, confirmed that the manager and owner were among those taken in for questioning.",
      "Tourist police offices are common in Southeast Asia and are set up specifically to help with incidents involving tourists and other foreigners.",

      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

      "BERLIN -- The smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and hot bratwurst are wafting through the air across the German capital again, as the city's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening their doors this week. But the annual tradition that Germans have cherished since the Middle Ages \u2014 and successfully exported to much of the Western world \u2014 has become a pretty diverse affair, at least in Berlin.",
      "The city of 3.8 million, which takes pride in its tolerance and diversity, offers Christmas markets for pretty much every taste these days. Nowadays, almost 40% of Berliners have immigrant roots, and the city's LGBTQ+ community is considered one of the biggest in the country.",
      "So it comes as no surprise that popular Christmas markets include a LGBTQ+ one offering rainbow pierogi and entertainment by drag queens, a Scandinavian market selling moose goulash and reindeer salami and a market tempting revelers with naughty gift ideas, along with a historical market that takes visitors back to medieval times.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to do something for the LGBTQ+ community and offer something positive in a safe environment where everyone\u2019s welcome, no matter what background,\u201d said Middleton, who moved to Berlin from London three years ago \u201cfor love.\"",
      "Middleton was busy selling gay-themed Christmas shirts next to stalls offering suggestive candles and soaps in neon colors.",

      "\u201cYou can meet lots of friends, relax, enjoy a mulled wine and simply kick off the Christmas season,\u201d said Marco Klingberg, who visited the market with friends on Monday night.",
      "Klingberg, a police officer and member of the LGBTQ+ police organization in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, pointed out that despite the city's reputation as a gay-friendly city, attacks on members of the community are a concern, and it was great to have a protected environment for celebrating.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s a safe space,\u201d he said.",
      "Security is an issue not only at the LGBTQ+ market, where all visitors undergo a bag check before entering. Groups of police officers were patrolling most markets on Monday night, as memories of a deadly terror attack on a Christmas market eight years ago are still fresh for many Berliners.",
      "On Dec. 19, 2016, an Islamist attacker plowed through a crowd of Christmas market-goers with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more in the German capital. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.",
      "Despite increased surveillance, visitors at the Scandinavian-themed Lucia market in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood were hanging out in crowds on the compound of a former brewery. Kids enjoyed merry-go-rounds while their parents stood in line for Finnish honey and Icelandic mulled wine infused with hard liquor, or chatted and warmed up at fire pits.",
      "\u201cI've been coming here every year since kindergarten times,\u201d said Mathilda Schmidt, 21, pointing to kids cheering as they jumped on a trampoline. She was standing in line with her boyfriend for a bratwurst and potato pancakes.",
      "At Humboldt Forum Christmas market near the Spree river, vendors were offering more exotic dishes including jerk chicken with cooked bananas at a Jamaican food stand, Argentinian empanadas, French salamis and Hungarian langos, a deep-fried flatbread.",
      "While the city's biggest markets are open for weeks and usually close only the day before Christmas Eve, smaller markets often open for a weekend or a day.",
      "They include the Kinky Christmas market in the Kreuzberg neighborhood that invites visitors on Dec. 1 only, seeking those who may find traditional markets \u201ctoo overwhelmingly contemplative and traditional.\u201d Over 20 stalls will offer sexy \u201cfashion, accessories, jewelry, toys and all kinds of naughty gift ideas,\u201d the city of Berlin says on its website.",
      "While Berliners seem to nonchalantly enjoy the variety of Christmas market offerings, they were fiercely united in their complaint about the increasing price of mulled wine \u2014 with one small cup now selling for up to seven euros ($7.36)."

      "In 2000, Israel withdrew its forces from most of southern Lebanon along a U.N.-demarcated \u201cBlue Line\u201d that separated the two countries and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, which most of the world considers occupied Syrian territory. U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, increased their presence along the line of withdrawal.",
      "Resolution 1701 was supposed to complete Israel\u2019s withdrawal from southern Lebanon and ensure Hezbollah would move north of the Litani River, keeping the area exclusively under the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers.",
      "Up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers would help to maintain calm, return displaced Lebanese and secure the area alongside the Lebanese military.",
      "The goal was long-term security, with land borders eventually demarcated to resolve territorial disputes.",
      "The resolution also reaffirmed previous ones that call for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon \u2014 Hezbollah among them.",
      "\u201cIt was made for a certain situation and context,\u201d Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told The Associated Press. \u201cBut as time goes on, the essence of the resolution begins to hollow.\u201d",
      "For years, Lebanon and Israel blamed each other for countless violations along the tense frontier. Israel said Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force and growing arsenal remained, and accused the group of using a local environmental organization to spy on troops. Lebanon complained about Israeli military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there was no active conflict.",
      "\u201cYou had a role of the UNIFIL that slowly eroded like any other peacekeeping with time that has no clear mandate,\u201d said Joseph Bahout, the director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy at the American University of Beirut. \u201cThey don\u2019t have permission to inspect the area without coordinating with the Lebanese army.\u201d",
      "UNIFIL for years has urged Israel to withdraw from some territory north of the frontier, but to no avail. In the ongoing war, the peacekeeping mission has accused Israel, as well as Hezbollah, of obstructing and harming its forces and infrastructure.",
      "Hezbollah\u2019s power, meanwhile, has grown, both in its arsenal and as a political influence in the Lebanese state.",
      "The Iran-backed group was essential in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power when armed opposition groups tried to topple him, and it supports Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen. It has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles pointed at Israel, and has introduced drones into its arsenal.",
      "Hanna says Hezbollah \u201cis something never seen before as a non-state actor\u201d with political and military influence.",
      "Israel's security Cabinet approved the ceasefire agreement late Tuesday, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. The ceasefire is set to take hold at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday.",
      "Efforts led by the U.S. and France for the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah underscored that they still view the resolution as key. For almost a year, Washington has promoted various versions of a deal that would gradually lead to its full implementation.",
      "International mediators hope that by boosting financial support for the Lebanese army \u2014 which was not a party in the Israel-Hezbollah war \u2014 Lebanon can deploy some 6,000 additional troops south of the Litani River to help enforce the resolution. Under the deal, an international monitoring committee headed by the United States would oversee implementation to ensure that Hezbollah and Israel\u2019s withdrawals take place.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the committee would work or how potential violations would be reported and dealt with.",
      "The circumstances now are far more complicated than in 2006. Some are still skeptical of the resolution's viability given that the political realities and balance of power both regionally and within Lebanon have dramatically changed since then.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re tying 1701 with a hundred things,\u201d Bahout said. \u201cA resolution is the reflection of a balance of power and political context.\u201d",
      "Now with the ceasefire in place, the hope is that Israel and Lebanon can begin negotiations to demarcate their land border and settle disputes over several points along the Blue Line for long-term security after decades of conflict and tension."

It was to go into effect early Wednesday with a two-month initial halt in fighting. The deal requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops return to their side of the border.",
      "Civilians on both sides will continue to pay the price \u2014 in the coming hours, months and years. In Lebanon, Israeli forces have blown up entire villages.

      "Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel returned fire, and the two sides have been exchanging barrages ever since.",
      "Israel escalated its campaign in mid-September, launching airstrikes that killed top Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his deputies. It is widely thought to have been behind an attack earlier that month in which pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members exploded, killing several people, including civilians, and wounding thousands.",
      "Israeli ground troops invaded at the start of October and have been battling Hezbollah in a belt of towns and villages near the border.",

      "Israel has approved a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting linked to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel approved a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon's Hezbollah militants on Tuesday that would end nearly 14 months of fighting linked to the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The ceasefire, starting at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday, would mark the first major step toward ending the regionwide unrest triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable.",
      "Hours before the ceasefire with Hezbollah was to take effect, Israel carried out the most intense wave of strikes in Beirut and its southern suburbs since the start of the conflict and issued a record number of evacuation warnings. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities.",
      "Another huge airstrike shook Beirut shortly after the ceasefire was announced. \u201cThe last stages have been the most scary,\u201d said Ahmad Khateeb, who fled to the city\u2019s seaside promenade with relatives.",
      "There appeared to be lingering disagreement over whether Israel would have the right to strike Hezbollah if it believed the militants had violated the agreement, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted was part of the deal but which Lebanese and Hezbollah officials have rejected.",
      "Israel's security Cabinet approved the U.S.-France-brokered ceasefire agreement after Netanyahu presented it, his office said. U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington, called the agreement \u201cgood news\u201d and said his administration would make a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "The Biden administration spent much of this year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza but the talks repeatedly sputtered to a halt. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East without saying how.",
      "Still, any halt to the fighting in Lebanon is expected to reduce the likelihood of war between Israel and Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas and exchanged direct fire with Israel on two occasions earlier this year.",
      "Netanyahu presented the ceasefire proposal to Cabinet ministers after a televised address in which he listed accomplishments against Israel\u2019s enemies across the region. He said a ceasefire with Hezbollah would further isolate Hamas in Gaza and allow Israel to focus on its main enemy, Iran.",
      "\u201cIf Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack,\u201d he said. \u201cFor every violation, we will attack with might.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance.",
      "Biden said Israel reserved the right to quickly resume operations in Lebanon if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the truce, but that the deal \"was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office said Israel appreciated the U.S. efforts in securing the deal but \u201creserves the right to act against every threat to its security.\u201d",
      "Lebanon\u2019s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire and described it as a crucial step toward stability and the return of displaced people.",
      "Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday it had not seen the agreement in its final form.",
      "\u201cAfter reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,\u201d Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah\u2019s political council, told the Al Jazeera news network.",
      "\u201cWe want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state,\" he said, referring to Israel's demand for freedom of action. \u201cAny violation of sovereignty is refused.\u201d",
      "Even as ceasefire efforts gained momentum in recent days, Israel continued to strike what it called Hezbollah targets across Lebanon while the militants fired rockets, missiles and drones across the border.",
      "An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in central Beirut \u2014 the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.",
      "Israel also struck a building in Beirut's bustling commercial district of Hamra for the first time, hitting a site around 400 meters (yards) from Lebanon\u2019s Central Bank. There were no reports of casualties.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck targets linked to Hezbollah's financial arm.",
      "The evacuation warnings covered many areas, including parts of Beirut that previously were not targeted. Residents fled. Traffic was gridlocked, with mattresses tied to some cars. Dozens of people, some wearing pajamas, gathered in a central square, huddling under blankets or standing around fires as Israeli drones buzzed overhead.",
      "Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a major presence, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where the U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, is headquartered.",
      "UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said peacekeepers will not evacuate.",
      "The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",
      "Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have exchanged barrages ever since.",
      "Israel escalated its bombardment in mid-September and later sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire so tens of thousands of evacuated Israelis could return to their homes.",
      "More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members.",
      "Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to  evacuate in the country\u2019s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive in Lebanon.",

    "story": [
      "Witnesses say a powerful rebel group has seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government",
      "BANGKOK -- A powerful rebel group has seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government, according to witnesses.",
      "The apparent loss of Kanpaiti to the Kachin Independence Army leaves Myanmar's military in control of only one town with a border crossing, Muse, and deprives it of potential profits from the mines that provide China with rare earth minerals critical for electric motors and wind turbines, as well as high-tech weapons and a broad range of electronics.",
      "Neither Col. Naw Bu, the KIA's spokesperson, nor Thet Swe, spokesperson for the military, responded to multiple requests for comment, but several local media outlets reported that Kanpaiti fell last week. The ongoing civil war and military restrictions make travel for journalists nearly impossible, but the reports were confirmed by witnesses by telephone.",
      "Video clips circulating on social media, which could not be independently verified, showed what was said to be a KIA member raising the group's flag at the tunnel through the mountain to China. Other clips showed a vast quantity of weapons allegedly captured by the KIA.",
      "The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minority groups in its border regions which have struggled for decades for more autonomy.",
      "The once-mighty armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, have suffered a series of unprecedented defeats over the past year, especially in areas to the east near the Chinese border and in the western state of Rakhine, after an alliance of three powerful militias launched a coordinated offensive on Oct. 27, 2023.",
      "Since then, other militias organized along ethnic lines have joined in, including the KIA in the northern state of Kachin.",
      "In Kachin's so-called Special Region 1, where Kanpaiti is located, the KIA since late September has been increasing assaults on a rival ethnic militia, the New Democratic Army-Kachin, which is allied with the government military and had provided border guard forces.",
      "The NDA-K also controlled the web of small, unlicensed operations where heavy rare earth elements are mined, then sold directly to China\u2019s big state-owned mining conglomerates or through intermediaries.",
      "There are more than 300 unregulated mines in the area, producing most of the $1.4 billion in rare earths for sale to China last year \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities,\u201d according to a report issued by London-based environmental group Global Witness in May.",
      "It's not clear how much of the profits flowed to the military government, and how much directly to the NDA-K, however, and while the loss of any revenue stream would be bad for the military, the fall of Kanpaiti is not necessarily a game changer for the overall conflict, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project.",
      "\u201cThis is another series of embarrassing losses for the regime, but may not significantly affect the regime\u2019s ability to wage war,\u201d he said. \u201cChina had already shut most of the border to dissuade the KIA\u2019s offensives, and the regime is thought to primarily generate revenue through other means than rare earths.\u201d",
      "China was able to use its close ties to the regime and the Three Brotherhood Alliance groups to broker a ceasefire in January in northern Shan state, where much of the fighting has been. Hostilities resumed five months later after the ethnic alliance said the military had violated the ceasefire and has shown no signs of stopping, despite intense pressure from Beijing.",
      "China has likewise been pushing the KIA in Kachin to end the fighting, which has stopped cross-border trade, to little end.",
      "In its September push, the KIA was able to quickly seize four towns in Kachin, with the exception of Kanpaiti, including the NDA-K headquarters of Pang War.",
      "KIA forces advanced toward Kanpaiti on Nov. 20, and since consolidating control have called for the hundreds of residents who fled to return, a local community leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest.",
      "The report was confirmed by a spokesperson for Kachin Human Rights Watch, which is not affiliated with the New York-based watchdog group of a similar name, and a resident who saw the KIA troops enter the town. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest by authorities.",
      "Multiple Kachin-based news outlets and other Myanmar media reported that 300 government troops were able to escape by fleeing into China, then crossing back into Myanmar at the regime-controlled border town of Muse.",
      "Kachin Human Rights Watch's spokesperson said he had reports of regime soldiers fleeing to safety, but did not have further details."

      "Lebanese families with children diagnosed with cancer are now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war",
      "BEIRUT -- Carol Zeghayer gripped her IV as she hurried down the brightly lit hallway of Beirut\u2019s children\u2019s cancer center. The 9-year-old's face brightened when she spotted her playmates from the oncology ward.",
      "Diagnosed with cancer just months before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel erupted in October 2023, Carol relies on weekly trips to the center in the Lebanese capital for treatment.",
      "But what used to be a 90-minute drive, now takes up to three hours on a mountainous road to skirt the heavy bombardment in south Lebanon, but still not without danger from Israeli airstrikes. The family is just one among many across Lebanon now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just a child. When they strike, she asks me, \u2018Mama, was that far?\u2019\u201d said her mother, Sindus Hamra.",
      "The family lives in Hasbaya, a province in southeastern Lebanon where the rumble of Israeli airstrikes has become part of daily life. Just 15 minutes away from their home, in the front-line town of Khiam, Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters clash amidst relentless bombardments.",
      "On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross.",
      "The bombardment hasn\u2019t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed.",
      "More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cHer situation is very tricky \u2014 her cancer can spread to her head,\u201d Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead.",
      "While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 among them were families with children battling cancer.",
      "The Children\u2019s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient\u2019s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center\u2019s fundraising and events executive.",
      "During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.",
      "\u201cThey had no place to go,\u201d she added. \"We\u2019ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.\u201d",
      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",
      "The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad\u2019s already fragile immune system.",
      "Now they\u2019ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home.",
      "The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents\u2019 home was bombed. \u201cAll our memories are gone,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams.",
      "\u201cWhen Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we\u2019d take him there once he finishes treatment.\u201d",
      "She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment.",
      "For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The United Nations in Chad has launched an internal investigation, following an Associated Press report on allegations of sexual exploitation of Sudanese refugees, which included aid workers.",
      "The statement, written days after the AP published the story last week, was seen on Tuesday. It said the seriousness of the allegations cited in the AP's story, warranted immediate and firm measures and that those responsible should be punished.",
      "\u201cRefugees are already vulnerable and traumatized by the events that led them to flee their country and under no circumstances should they be the victims of abuse by those who are supposed to help them,\u201d said Francois Batalingaya, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Chad.",

      "Earlier this month, the AP reported accusations by some Sudanese women and girls that men, including those meant to protect them such as humanitarian workers and local security forces, had instead sexually exploited them in Chad\u2019s sites for displaced people. They said the men offered money, easier access to assistance, and jobs. Such sexual exploitation in Chad is a crime.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them women, have streamed into Chad to escape Sudan\u2019s civil war, which has killed over 20,000 people.",
      "Sexual exploitation during large humanitarian crises is not uncommon, especially in displacement sites. Aid groups have long struggled to combat the issue, citing a lack of reporting by women, not enough funds to respond and a focus on first providing basic necessities.",
      "Experts say exploitation represents a deep failure by the aid community and that people seeking protection should never have to make choices driven by survival.",
      "The U.N. said it raised the risk alert level for protection against sexual exploitation of abuse to four, which is very high, especially since Chad was already classified as a country at high risk. Raising the alert is meant to enable the U.N. to take rapid measures in the next three months, according to an internal email about the AP's article, circulated among aid groups and seen by the AP.",
      "The UN said it's cooperating with local authorities and human rights groups to hold those responsible to account and that refugees\u2019 trust in humanitarians is paramount.",
      "The organization has encouraged anyone with information about exploitation to come forward."

      "The women's rights group successfully challenged that law, arguing that its redefinition of \u201cwoman\u201d went beyond parliament's powers.",
      "Scottish officials then issued guidance stating that the definition of \u201cwoman\u201d included a transgender woman who has a gender recognition certificate.",

      "\u201cNot tying the definition of sex to its ordinary meaning means that public boards could conceivably comprise of 50% men, and 50% men with certificates, yet still lawfully meet the targets for female representation,\" the group\u2019s director Trina Budge said.",
      "The challenge was rejected by a court in 2022, but the group was granted permission last year to take its case to the Supreme Court.",

It is an immutable biological state.\u201d",

      "Pressed on whether Italy would arrest Netanyahu if he stepped foot on Italian soil, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said he believed the warrants were \u201cunenforceable\u201d since Netanyahu is a sitting head of a government that isn\u2019t a member of the court. When asked if that same logic applies to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also the subject of an ICC warrant, Tajani said the situations were different.",
      "\u201cYou have to be very pragmatic because when something in theory isn\u2019t applicable, it runs the risk of being just a political message.\u201d",
      "The G7 meeting of foreign ministers, the last of the Biden administration, was dominated by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Ministers were heartened by indications that a ceasefire might soon be announced between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a deal would also improve prospects for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\u201cBecause one of the things that Hamas has sought from Day One is to get others in on the fight to create multiple fronts, to make sure that Israel is having to fight in a whole series of different places,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as long as it\u2019s thought that that was possible, that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s held back from doing what\u2019s necessary to end the conflict. Now, it seems that the cavalry is not on the way. That may incentivize it to do what it needs to do to end this conflict.\u201d",
      "The G7 ministers were joined by the foreign ministers of the \u201cArab Quintet\u201d \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday there were \u201cno excuses\u201d for Israel to refuse to accept a ceasefire, saying all its security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal.",
      "Borrell said under the proposed agreement, the U.S. would chair a ceasefire implementation committee, with France participating at Lebanon\u2019s request. The outgoing EU foreign policy chief also called for increased pressure on Israel to not give into extremists in the government who were refusing to accept the deal. Speaking on the sidelines of the G7 meeting, he warned that if a ceasefire is not implemented, \u201cLebanon will fall apart.\u201d",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, months of fighting between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah have erupted into a full-blown war in recent months, with Israel killing Hezbollah\u2019s main leaders and sending ground forces into southern Lebanon.",
      "Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded more than 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles in northern Israel and in the fighting on the ground in Lebanon.",
      "Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, also said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries there have been completely impeded.",
      "While the G7 meeting was dominated Monday by the Mideast conflicts, attention turned Tuesday to Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha briefed the ministers on Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure.",
      "In their final statement, the ministers condemned Russia\u2019s use of North Korean troops in Ukraine and its \u201cirresponsible and threatening nuclear rhetoric.\u201d",
      "The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and G7 members are concerned about how the incoming Trump administration will change the U.S. approach.",
      "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours \u2014 comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.",
      "Tensions have heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv\u2019s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory.",
      "The final G7 communique vowed the group\u2019s continued commitment to Ukraine. \u201cOur support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence will remain unwavering,\u201d the ministers said.",
      "Blinken, at his final G7 before the Biden administration leaves office, said he was certain Europe would continue its assistance to Ukraine and that he would do his best in the remaining weeks to do Washington\u2019s part.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re determined to do in the remainder of this administration is to do everything possible to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to be able ... to fight through 2025 if necessary, or if there\u2019s a negotiation, be able to negotiate from a position of strength,\u201d he said.",

Security Council resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said late Tuesday.",

Most of the other hostages Hamas captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack were released during a ceasefire last year.",
      "The prospect of a ceasefire deal in Lebanon has raised desperation among the relatives of captives still held in Gaza, who once hoped that the release of hostages from Gaza would be included. Instead of a comprehensive deal, the ceasefire on the table is instead narrowly confined to Lebanon.",
      "Dozens of Israelis were also demonstrating against the expected cease-fire, gathering outside Israel\u2019s military headquarters in central Tel Aviv.",
      "One of the protesters, Yair Ansbacher, says the deal is merely a return to the failed 2006 U.N. resolution that was meant to uproot Hezbollah from the area. \u201cOf course that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cThis agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.\u201d",

      "The Israeli military spokesman issued a flurry of evacuation warnings for many areas, including areas in Beirut that have not been targeted throughout the war, like the capital\u2019s commercial Hamra district, where many people displaced by the war have been staying.",
      "The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks in Lebanon during the final hours before a ceasefire is reached, sparked panic and sent residents fleeing in their cars to safer areas.",
      "In areas close to Hamra, families including women and children were seen running away toward the Mediterranean Sea\u2019s beaches carrying their belongings. Traffic was completely gridlocked as people tried to get away, honking their car horns as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead.",
      "The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut\u2019s suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck \u2014 a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold.",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 The independent civilian commission of inquiry into the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has found Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly responsible for the failures leading up to the attack, alongside former defense ministers, the army chief and the heads of the security services.",
      "The civil commission presented its findings today after a four-month probe in which it heard some 120 witnesses. It was set up by relatives of victims of the Hamas attack, in response to the absence of any state probe.",
      "The commission determined that the Israeli government, its army and security services \u201cfailed in their primary mission of protecting the citizens of Israel.\u201d It said Netanyahu was responsible for ignoring \u201crepeated warnings\u201d ahead of Oct. 7, 2023 for what it described as his appeasing approach over the years toward Hamas, and for \u201cundermining all decision-making centers, including the cabinet and the National Security Council, in a way that prevented any serious discussion\u201d on security issues.",
      "The commission further determined that the military and defense leaders bear blame for ignoring warnings from within the army, and for reducing the army\u2019s presence along the Gaza border while relying excessively on technological means. On the day of the Hamas attack, the report says, the army\u2019s response was both slow and lacking.",
      "The civil commission called for the immediate establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Netanyahu has opposed launching a state commission of inquiry, arguing that such an investigation should begin only once the war is over.",
      "JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says its ground troops have reached parts of Lebanon\u2019s Litani River \u2014 a focal point of the emerging ceasefire.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the army said it had reached the Wadi Slouqi area in southern Lebanon and clashed with Hezbollah forces.",
      "Under a proposed ceasefire, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border.",

      "The strikes come hours before Israel\u2019s cabinet was scheduled to meet to discuss a proposal to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The proposal calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River.",

Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries have been completely impeded.",
      "\u201cThe two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,\u201d for desperate Palestinians, he said. \u201cHunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.\u201d",

      "A South Korean man has been sentenced to a suspended prison term for deliberately gaining weight to evade military service",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean man has been sentenced to a suspended prison term for deliberately gaining more than 20 kilograms (44 pounds) to evade a tougher role in the country\u2019s military conscription system, a Seoul court said Tuesday.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men must serve in the military for 18-21 months, but individuals with health issues can instead carry out their duties at non-military facilities such as welfare centers and community service centers. If their problems are serious, they are exempted from their military duties.",
      "The Seoul Eastern District Court said it sentenced the man to one year in prison, suspended for two years, for violating the country\u2019s military service act.",
      "The court said an acquaintance of the man received a suspended 1-year prison term for aiding his crime.",
      "Local media reported they are friends, both aged 26, but the court said it couldn\u2019t confirm the reports.",
      "An exam in 2017 found the man suitable to become an active-duty soldier at 169 centimeters (5 feet 6 inches) tall and weighting 83 kilograms (183 pounds). But with the advice of his acquaintance that he could get a social service grade if he was overweight, he doubled his daily food consumption, focused on eating high-calorie food products and quit his part-time job as a delivery worker, according to the court\u2019s public affairs office.",
      "In three physical exams from 2022-2023, the man weighted 102-105 kilograms (225-231 pounds), a weight that made him fit for social service. Just before those exams, he drank a large amount of water as well, according to the court.",
      "It was unclear how the crime was caught and whether the man began serving his military duty before he was tried. The court only said the man had promised to fulfill his military duty faithfully.",
      "The court said both the defendants and prosecutors didn\u2019t appeal the Nov. 13 ruling.",
      "South Korea maintains a military conscription system due to threats from rival North Korea. But exemptions or dodging of military duties is a highly sensitive domestic issue, because the draft forces young men to suspend their studies or professional careers.",
      "Each year, about 50-60 cases of dodging military duties have been reported, according to the Military Manpower Administration. It said common ways to evade military duties include gaining or losing weight excessively or men with health issues not taking necessary medical treatments before physical tests."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A major political storm set off by a bitter feud between the Philippine president and the vice president is testing an Asian democracy that has long been troubled by rowdy politics, poor law enforcement and bareface impunity.",
      "Just over two years ago, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte won in landslide electoral victories on a campaign battle cry of national unity.",
      "But their fragile alliance rapidly floundered over major differences, including their leanings toward either the United States or China, and Marcos\u2019 rejection of the bloody crackdown on illegal drugs launched by his predecessor and Duterte\u2019s father, Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "The hostilities came to a head over the weekend when Sara Duterte told reporters she had arranged for Marcos, his wife and his cousin and speaker of the House of Representatives, to be assassinated if she were fatally attacked herself. Marcos went on TV and declared he was ready to fight back.",
      "Here are the key figures in the unfolding political crisis:",
      "Like her father, ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, the 46-year-old lawyer is a populist politician known for profanity-laced outbursts and temper that often clashed with official decorum. She made the political elites wary but endeared herself to ordinary people in a nation where name recall, political patronage and star-studded campaigns matter more than policy and governance platforms. As a provincial city mayor, Duterte successfully ran as Marcos' running mate in the 2022 race. But soon rifts appeared, including Duterte's opposition to congressional inquiries led by Marcos' allies into the thousands of deaths in the crackdown on drugs during Rodrigo Duterte's presidency 2016-2022. Also being investigated is her alleged misuse of funds while she served as education secretary.",
      "When Duterte's chief of staff was temporarily detained by legislators after refusing to cooperate with the inquiry, Duterte made the threats in an online news conference against Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. She also accused Marcos\u2019 family of responsibility for the 1983 assassination of an opposition leader, which sparked a 1986 pro-democracy uprising that ousted Ferdinand Marcos, the current president's father.",
      "___",
      "Marcos' resounding electoral victory in 2022 was regarded as one of the most stunning reversal of fortunes for his family, which had fled the Philippines following the 1986 army-backed \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt and returned years later. He inherited a battered economy, divisive politics and calls for him help prosecute his predecessor for the drug killings, which are being investigated by the International Criminal Court.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte has accused Marcos of being a weak leader and a drug addict, accusations the president denied. The new course Marcos chartered for the Philippines broke away with Duterte, who built close ties with China and Russia and antagonized the U.S. Marcos broadened defense ties with Washington and began going public with China\u2019s aggressive actions to claim territory in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "In a sign of growing enmity, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos disclosed her ill-feelings toward Sara Duterte in a radio interview in April. Duterte resigned two months later as Marcos' education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. She said last month that her relationship with Marcos had \u201cgone so toxic\u201d she has imagined \u201ccutting his head.\u201d Addressing the country on Monday, Marcos said he would fight the vice president\u2019s \u201ccriminal plot\u201d and uphold the rule of law. \u201cThe truth should not be summarily executed,\u201d Marcos said in Tagalog, using a term associated with Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s drug killings.",
      "___",
      "One of Asia\u2019s most unorthodox contemporary leaders until his six-year term ended in 2022, Duterte, 79 and in frail health, has retained a sizable following and remains one of the president's harshest critics. In his decades-long political career, he carved a name for his profanity-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West while nurturing close ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has accused Marcos, his wife and the House speaker of financial anomalies and once warned Marcos could be ousted like his father if they attempt constitutional reforms to allegedly prolong their grip on power. In a news conference on Monday, Duterte asked the military how long it would continue to support a president \u201cwho\u2019s a drug addict.\"",
      "\u201cThere is a fractured governance \u2026 It is only the military who can correct it,\u201d Duterte said, but clarified that he was not calling for a coup.",
      "___",
      "Widely speculated to be harboring plans to run for the presidency in 2028, House Speaker Martin Romualdez has been accused by Sara Duterte of trying to destroy her reputation to eliminate a future contender. The 61-year-old member of a wealthy clan in the central Philippines, he has played a crucial role as head of the lower chamber, which is dominated by Marcos' allies. He will be key to handling a possible impeachment complaint against the vice president for the alleged misuse of funds. Addressing the House on Monday, Romualdez stressed that Sara Duterte should be held accountable for the death threats against him, the president and his wife. \u201cThe gravity of such a confession demands accountability. It demands answers. It demands that we, as the representatives of the Filipino people, take a stand to protect our democracy from any and all forms of threats,\u201d Romualdez said.",

      "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to sharply raise tariffs on all Chinese imports and close some loopholes Chinese exporters currently use to sell their products more cheaply in the U.S. If enacted, his plans would likely raise prices in...",
      "YIWU, China -- Visitors who bought fridge magnets at Times Square or other tourist hotspots around New York in recent years most likely were purchasing the work of Du Jing or one of her fellow exporters in a small Chinese city that supplies the U.S. and the world with tons of small commodities.",
      "Du and her husband run Yiwu Xianchuang Handicraft Manufacturing in the eastern city of Yiwu, home to the world\u2019s largest wholesale market. Products from here -\u2013 ranging from plushies to glass vases and portable toolboxes -\u2013 are sold in stores and on online platforms around the world, including to U.S. consumers on Amazon.",
      "For years, the United States has been a major destination for Chinese goods, but exporters like those in Yiwu have been reducing their reliance on the world\u2019s largest consumer market as Beijing and Washington feud over trade. Some have moved production to Southeast Asia and other parts of the world to evade U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.",
      "Those trends look to accelerate under President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to sharply raise tariffs on all Chinese imports and close some loopholes exporters currently use to sell their products more cheaply in the U.S. If enacted, his plans would likely raise prices in America and squeeze sales and profit margins for Chinese exporters.",
      "Du, speaking from her booth in the Yiwu wholesale market, the walls covered in colorful magnets and keychains, isn\u2019t sure whether higher tariffs or a worsening U.S. market are to blame. What she knows is sales are down.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. market has shrunk a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me the feeling that it has something to do with their financial situation.\u201d",
      "American customers have been putting a lot of pressure on prices since 2019, frowning at any product that wholesales for more than 25 cents, she said.",
      "In contrast, the Middle East has become a better market, with higher prices and increasingly larger orders, she said.",
      "Elsewhere in the sprawling market, the owner of Yiwu Bixuan Import Export Co. Ltd., echoed her thoughts. Chen Yong's trading company exports glass vases and other home decor, and Chen said business with the U.S. and Europe has suffered over the past few years \u2013 but it has boomed with other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and Russia.",
      "The share of China's exports going to the U.S. dropped from 19% in 2018 to 15% last year, according to China customs data, even as China's overall exports are forecast to reach a record high this year.",
      "Trump has mentioned tariff hikes of 60% or more. On Monday, he said he would impose an extra 10% tariff on goods from China and a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Higher tariffs would force Chen to raise prices or accept lower profit margins, he said. If American customers won\u2019t accept higher prices, the only choice would be to turn elsewhere.",
      "\u201cWe have to wait and see how much he will increase the tariff before knowing how big the impact on us can be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know now.\u201d",
      "A 60% tariff would have a severe impact on Chinese exports to the U.S., said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.",
      "\u201cMany companies will completely halt their trade with the U.S.,\u201d he predicted. \"If the tariffs were not that huge, larger companies could cope better with the situation than medium and small companies. But if it\u2019s 60%, no one can face that.\u201d",
      "Light manufacturing and textiles are among the industries expected to be hit hardest by new tariffs, along with steel and computers, according to a report by Chinese brokerage Caicong Securities.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese products. The tariffs put the brakes on a fairly steady rise in Chinese exports to the U.S. They fell at first, then bounced back as the U.S. economy boomed, before leveling off at $500 billion last year.",
      "The Biden administration kept most of Trump's duties and layered on fresh ones on products such as steel, solar cells and electric vehicles. Biden\u2019s approach has focused on sectors considered strategic, such as artificial intelligence and green energy. Trump\u2019s proposed blanket tariffs could spill over into daily-use goods, pressuring smaller manufacturers like those in Yiwu.",
      "Furniture, toys and games were among the top Chinese export categories to the U.S. last year \u2014 after electronics and machinery \u2014 according to trade data compiled by the United Nations.",
      "Trump has vowed to close loopholes through which Chinese goods bypass U.S. tariffs. One such loophole is an exemption that allows small packages under $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Many of the products sold through Amazon\u2019s third-party marketplace and on the Chinese platforms Temu and Shein qualify for this exemption.",
      "Biden\u2019s administration proposed restricting the tax waiver for goods subject to U.S.-China tariffs, and Trump is expected to move forward with such restrictions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis would be a crushing blow to Chinese exporters who have built business models around those low-value exports,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund.",
      "It would also be \u201ca big loss to low-income American consumers,\" said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. \"Evidence shows that they really benefit from the exemption.\u201d",
      "One workaround for Chinese companies has been moving production abroad. Since Trump started a trade war with China during his first administration, the average U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods have been about 20%, according to Ma Hong, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "To avoid these tariffs, some Chinese companies have shifted their factories to countries like Vietnam and Mexico.",
      "Shenzhen HIHO Luggage and Bag Industry Development Co., Ltd. opened a factory in Indonesia in 2021. The luggage producer employs about 600 workers in Indonesia and has a similar workforce in China, where it runs factories in three provinces.",
      "The company exports about a quarter of its production to the U.S., according to its marketing director, Steven Wang. He believes that some of the company\u2019s clients in Mexico may also be reselling their products to the U.S.",
      "\u201cNo one likes to do business at a loss,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIf Trump imposes any additional tariffs on Chinese goods from ASEAN countries or Mexico, we may need to move the factories somewhere else.\u201d",

      "The latest development came hours after thousands of Khan supporters, defying government warnings, broke through a barrier of shipping containers blocking off Islamabad and entered a high-security zone, where they clashed with security forces, facing tear gas shelling, mass detentions and gunfire.",
      "Tension has been high in Islamabad since Sunday when supporters of the former prime minister began a \u201clong march\u201d from the restive northwest to demand his release. Khan has been in a prison for over a year and faces more than 150 criminal cases that his party says are politically motivated.",

      "Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d former national security adviser John Bolton's \u201cThe Room Where it Happened\u201d and Bob Woodward's \u201cFear.\u201d Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's \u201cA Handmaid's Tale,\u201d which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.",
      "But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family \u2014 they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's \u201cWho Could Ever Love You\u201d and Woodward's \u201cWar\u201d were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been there many times, with all those books,\u201d HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books \u2014 perhaps analyzing the recent election \u2014 because \u201cthere's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,\u201d one that would welcome \u201can intelligent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the reboot of any hit TV show,\u201d says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cYou\u2019re not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it\u2019s replacing.\u201d",
      "In the days following Trump's victory, \u201cThe Handmaid's Tale\u201d and George Orwell's \u201c1984\u201d returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny,\" a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and Hegseth's \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d \u2014 and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.",
      "First lady Melania Trump's memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.",
      "\u201cThe Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,\u201d says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. \u201cAfter Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.\u201d",
      "Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers \u2014 most recently Hachette Book Group \u2014 have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists \u2014 if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.",
      "A new \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a \u201cknown peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.\u201d",
      "A publicist for Wolff said he was declining comment.",
      "Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller \u201cRage,\u201d told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how \u201cout of control he gets,\u201d Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.",
      "\u201cHe wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.\u201d",

      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Brazilian beef was headed back to the shelves of Carrefour-owned grocery stores Tuesday after a brief boycott sparked by remarks from the French company\u2019s chief executive about nations in the South America trade bloc Mercosur.",
      "Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard apologized to Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture for social media posts in which he said that Mercosur nations had an unfair competitive advantage due to lower environmental and sanitary standards. Bompard was seeking to show support for French farmers angered over a potential trade deal with the bloc, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe know that Brazilian agriculture provides high-quality meat, complies with regulations and offers great flavor. If Carrefour France\u2019s communication caused confusion and may have been interpreted as questioning our partnership with Brazilian agriculture or as a criticism of it, we apologize,\" Bompard wrote.",
      "The Brazilian ministry published his letter on its website Tuesday, along with a statement asserting that the country's agricultural practices are \"of exceptional quality and fully compliant with one of the world\u2019s most stringent environmental legislations.\u201d",
      "Atacadao, a Brazilian food warehouse giant owned by Carrefour, said in a statement that it expected beef product restocking to \u201cnormalize\u201d in coming days. Beef giants JBS and Marfrig were among the suppliers that had boycotted the French company.",
      "Since last week, French farmers have protested against negotiations for an  EU-Mercosur trade deal that would increase agricultural imports to EU countries from South America.",
      "French farmers fear it will affect their livelihoods. An initial agreement was reached in 2019, but negotiations have faltered since then due to opposition that also includes some European governments.",
      "Brazil\u2019s agribusiness sector also fears that the pending European Union Deforestation Regulation will outlaw the sale of forest-derived products within the EU\u2019s 27-nation bloc if companies can\u2019t prove their goods are not linked to deforestation. Its scope includes soy and cattle, Brazil\u2019s top agricultural exports. Almost half of the country\u2019s cattle is raised in the Amazon region, where 90% of deforested land since 1985 has turned into pasture, according to MapBiomas, a nonprofit network.

      "Law enforcement officials say they have broken up a shoplifting ring that stole nearly $2 million in merchandise from well-known stores and resold the items in New York City as well as in the Dominican Republic",
      "NEW YORK -- A shoplifting ring that stole nearly $2 million in clothes and beauty products from Macy\u2019s and other well-known stores in the U.S. and then resold them in New York City and the Dominican Republic has been busted, law enforcement officials announced Tuesday.",
      "Five New Yorkers have been charged with felony possession of stolen property, conspiracy and other related crimes, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said.",
      "The bust served as a reminder to shoppers as the holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest with Black Friday this week to make sure they are supporting legitimate establishments, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen a deal seems too good to be true, I guarantee you, it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d Katz said.",
      "Nationally, businesses lose roughly $100 billion and the average family pays $500 more a year because of the impact of organized retail theft, according to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who joined the district attorney and other law enforcement officials in Queens.",
      "The Democrat said the arrests also marked the first time anyone has been charged under a new criminal statute of fostering the sale of stolen goods that she recently signed into law to help crack down on retail theft.",
      "\u201cThis is real simple. We\u2019ve had enough with criminals preying on our citizens,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cWe are sick and tired of our citizens feeling they\u2019re vulnerable to random crimes on the streets or these sophisticated organized crime rings. And we are coming after you.\u201d",
      "Katz, the district attorney, said the group stole high-end makeup, perfume, beauty products, designer clothing and accessories from stores ranging from Macy\u2019s to Victoria\u2019s Secret, American Eagle, Sephora and Ulta Beauty over a roughly two-year period.",
      "The group\u2019s leaders, married couple Cristopher Guzman and Yvelisse Guzman Batista, directed shoplifting crews to steal specific merchandise as they hit multiple stores in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and elsewhere along the East Coast, she said.",
      "They also paid truck drivers to divert products bound for retailers from manufacturer warehouses directly to locations under their control.",
      "The group, operating out of a home in Queens, then resold the merchandise online as well as at a brick-and-mortar boutique called Yvelisse Fashion in Santiago, a city in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Vince Scala, a lawyer for the couple and two of the other defendants, said his clients pleaded not guilty at their arraignment Saturday. They were released pending their next court date in January.",
      "\u201cThe charges are only a couple of days old, and I have not seen a single piece of evidence, discovery or police reports,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to reviewing the case at the appropriate time.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s announcement is part of a broader push from Hochul to counter Republican criticisms that Democrats in New York are soft on public safety issues, an issue that hurt her party in the 2022 midterm elections and has remained a consistent talking point for the GOP.",
      "Earlier this year, Hochul signed off on a handful of policies aimed at cracking down on retail theft, including increased criminal penalties for assaulting retail workers, new funding for law enforcement teams dedicated to retail theft and tax credits for businesses to install security cameras.",
      "She also approved policies that allow prosecutors to combine the value of stolen goods when filing larceny charges and made it easier to criminally charge third-party sellers of stolen goods.",
      "Retail theft has also been a concern elsewhere.",
      "Videos of brazen shoplifting crews rampaging through stores have been widely shared on social media, fueling widespread frustration that retail crime is rampant and unpunished.",
      "Earlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly passed a tough-on-crime ballot measure that makes shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders again.",
      "The measure partly rolled back a progressive law passed by voters a decade ago downgrading several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors, including theft under $950 in value.",

      "Berlin's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening across the city this week, and organizers are taking an increasingly diverse approach",
      "BERLIN -- The smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and hot bratwurst are wafting through the air across the German capital again, as the city's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening their doors this week. But the annual tradition that Germans have cherished since the Middle Ages \u2014 and successfully exported to much of the Western world \u2014 has become a pretty diverse affair, at least in Berlin.",
      "The city of 3.8 million, which takes pride in its tolerance and diversity, offers Christmas markets for pretty much every taste these days. Nowadays, almost 40% of Berliners have immigrant roots, and the city's LGBTQ+ community is considered one of the biggest in the country.",
      "So it comes as no surprise that popular Christmas markets include a LGBTQ+ one offering rainbow pierogi and entertainment by drag queens, a Scandinavian market selling moose goulash and reindeer salami and a market tempting revelers with naughty gift ideas, along with a historical market that takes visitors back to medieval times.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely atmosphere,\u201d Paul Middleton said of the LGBTQ+ market Christmas Avenue, which is illuminated in the colors of the rainbow.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to do something for the LGBTQ+ community and offer something positive in a safe environment where everyone\u2019s welcome, no matter what background,\u201d said Middleton, who moved to Berlin from London three years ago \u201cfor love.\"",
      "Middleton was busy selling gay-themed Christmas shirts next to stalls offering suggestive candles and soaps in neon colors.",
      "The market also attracts heterosexual couples, neighborhood residents and groups of moms with baby strollers, said Sebastian Ahlefeld, a spokesman for Christmas Avenue.",
      "\u201cYou can meet lots of friends, relax, enjoy a mulled wine and simply kick off the Christmas season,\u201d said Marco Klingberg, who visited the market with friends on Monday night.",
      "Klingberg, a police officer and member of the LGBTQ+ police organization in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, pointed out that despite the city's reputation as a gay-friendly city, attacks on members of the community are a concern, and it was great to have a protected environment for celebrating.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s a safe space,\u201d he said.",
      "Security is an issue not only at the LGBTQ+ market, where all visitors undergo a bag check before entering. Groups of police officers were patrolling most markets on Monday night, as memories of a deadly terror attack on a Christmas market eight years ago are still fresh for many Berliners.",
      "On Dec. 19, 2016, an Islamist attacker plowed through a crowd of Christmas market-goers with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more in the German capital. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.",
      "Despite increased surveillance, visitors at the Scandinavian-themed Lucia market in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood were hanging out in crowds on the compound of a former brewery. Kids enjoyed merry-go-rounds while their parents stood in line for Finnish honey and Icelandic mulled wine infused with hard liquor, or chatted and warmed up at fire pits.",
      "\u201cI've been coming here every year since kindergarten times,\u201d said Mathilda Schmidt, 21, pointing to kids cheering as they jumped on a trampoline. She was standing in line with her boyfriend for a bratwurst and potato pancakes.",
      "At Humboldt Forum Christmas market near the Spree river, vendors were offering more exotic dishes including jerk chicken with cooked bananas at a Jamaican food stand, Argentinian empanadas, French salamis and Hungarian langos, a deep-fried flatbread.",
      "While the city's biggest markets are open for weeks and usually close only the day before Christmas Eve, smaller markets often open for a weekend or a day.",
      "They include the Kinky Christmas market in the Kreuzberg neighborhood that invites visitors on Dec. 1 only, seeking those who may find traditional markets \u201ctoo overwhelmingly contemplative and traditional.\u201d Over 20 stalls will offer sexy \u201cfashion, accessories, jewelry, toys and all kinds of naughty gift ideas,\u201d the city of Berlin says on its website.",
      "While Berliners seem to nonchalantly enjoy the variety of Christmas market offerings, they were fiercely united in their complaint about the increasing price of mulled wine \u2014 with one small cup now selling for up to seven euros ($7.36)."

      "Another round of wintry weather could complicate travel, though. California and Washington state continue to recover from damage and power outages from last week\u2019s storms. And an ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers could cause flight delays at some airports.",
      "Meanwhile, workers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport began what was expected to be a 24-hour strike on Monday over their demands for higher wages. Only a handful of flights were canceled, and there were fewer than 100 delays.",

Richard Blumenthal, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.",
      "The panel said Tuesday that American, Delta, United, Frontier, and Spirit raised $12.4 billion in fees for better seats between 2018 and 2023. Passengers paid extra to get more legroom or an aisle or window seat.",

      "The group said fees give consumers the choice of paying for the services they want and skipping ones they don\u2019t. It said that after accounting for inflation, average U.S. round-trip travel including fees dropped 14% from 2010 to 2023.",
      "There were about 1,900 flight delays into, out of or within the U.S. on Tuesday, with about 60 total cancellations, according to FlightAware, which tracks aviation trends across the country.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Interpol arrested 1,006 suspects in Africa during a massive two-month operation, clamping down on cybercrime that left tens of thousands of victims, including some who were trafficked, and produced millions in financial damages, the global police organization said Tuesday.",
      "Operation Serengeti, a joint operation with Afripol, the African Union's police agency, ran from Sept. 2 to Oct. 31 in 19 African countries and targeted criminals behind ransomware, business email compromise, digital extortion and online scams, the agency said in a statement.",

      "Interpol pinpointed 35,000 victims, with cases linked to nearly $193 million in financial losses worldwide, stating that local police authorities and private sector partners, including internet service providers, played a key role in the operation.",
      "Jalel Chelba, Afripol\u2019s Executive Director, said in the statement: \u201cThrough Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States,\u201d",
      "Serengeti\u2019s results were a \u201cdrastic increase\u201d compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol\u2019s Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press.",
      "Interpol\u2019s previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years.",
      "\u201cSignificant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,\u201d Gonzalez said.",
      "In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 13:22:29 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States.",
      "On Monday, Trump sent shockwaves across the nation's northern and southern borders, vowing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, as well as China, as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "In a pair of posts on his Truth Social site Trump railed against an influx of immigrants lacking permanent legal status, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \u201cuntil such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\u201d",
      "The president-elect asserts that tariffs \u2014 basically import taxes \u2014 will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.",
      "Economists are generally skeptical, considering tariffs to be a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money. They are especially alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs.",
      "Carl B. Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi, economists with High Frequency Economics said Tuesday that energy, automobiles and food supplies will be particularly hit hard.",
      "\u201cImposing tariffs on trade flows into the United States without first preparing alternative sources for the goods and services affected will raise the price of imported items at once,\" Weinberg and Farooqi wrote. \"Since many of these goods are consumer goods, households will be made poorer.\u201d",
      "High Frequency Economics believes the threats are not meant to support new trade policy and are instead a tool to elicit some changes along the borders and for imports from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Though Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Trump\u2019s tariff threats as unserious during her failed bid for the presidency, the Biden-Harris administration retained the taxes the Trump administration imposed on $360 billion in Chinese goods. And it imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.",
      "Indeed, the United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered trade and an increasingly aggressive China.",
      "They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.",
      "The tariff rates range from passenger cars (2.5%) to golf shoes (6%). Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.",
      "Trump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, its is importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs, and the money goes to U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That's why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.",
      "Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy",
      "By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices.",
      "Before the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy.",
      "Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations.",
      "In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government is expected to collect $81.4 billion in tariffs and fees. That's a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that's expected to come from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes.",
      "Still, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century.",
      "He has argued that tariffs on farm imports could lower food prices by aiding America\u2019s farmers. In fact, tariffs on imported food products would almost certainly send grocery prices up by reducing choices for consumers and competition for American producers.",
      "Tariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.",
      "Trump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.",
      "\u201cI can do it with a phone call,\u2019\u2019 he said at an August rally in North Carolina.",
      "If another country tries to start a war, he said he\u2019d issue a threat:",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, \u2018Sir, we won\u2019t go to war.\u2019 \u201d",
      "Tariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They're also likely to provoke retaliation.",
      "The European Union, for example, punched back against Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump\u2019s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.",
      "A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.",
      "Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.",
      "If Trump\u2019s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs \u2014 the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee."

      "Spotify has been giving its listeners breakdowns of their data since 2016. And each year, it\u2019s become a bigger production \u2014 and internet sensation. Spotify said its 2023 Wrapped was the \u201cbiggest ever created,\u201d in terms of audience reach and the kind of data it provided.",

      "The campaign has become a social media sensation, as people share and compare their Wrapped data with their friends and followers online.",
      "Past iterations have provided users with all kinds of breakdowns and facts, including whether they\u2019re among an artist\u2019s top listeners, as well as a personalized playlist of their top 100 songs of that year to save, share and listen to whenever they\u2019re feeling nostalgic.",
      "Spotify also creates a series of playlists that reflect national and global listening trends, featuring the top streamed artists and songs. In 2023, Taylor Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist, unseating Bad Bunny who had held the title for three years in a row.",
      "Each year has something new in store. In 2019, Wrapped included a summary of users\u2019 streaming trends for the entire decade. Last year, Spotify matched listeners to a Sound Town based on their artist affinities and how it lined up with those in other parts of the world.",
      "So far, the streaming platform has kept the highly anticipated release date of Wrapped under \u2026 er, wraps.",
      "In past years, it\u2019s been released after Thanksgiving, between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6.",
      "Each year, rumors tend to swell on social media around when Spotify stops collecting data in order to prepare their Wrapped results, and this year was no exception.

      "A representative for Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on when the company stops tracking data for Wrapped.",

      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Atlantic City is finally getting a beach replenishment project that casinos say is essential for visitors who have had precious little space to spread their towels for two sand-starved summers.",
      "Work is under way on a project by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to widen beaches in Atlantic City and some neighboring shore towns. It will place 1.2 million cubic yards of sand on the shoreline \u2014 enough to fill as many as 120,000 dump trucks \u2014 to make up for losses from normal tides as well as stronger, more frequent storms fueled by climate change.",
      "Atlantic City last received beach replenishment in 2020, and was due for additional sand in 2023. But Congress failed to approve funding for the project then, and the $38.2 million in funding that came through this year was too late for this summer.",
      "While the project should have wider beaches in place for next summer\u2019s tourism season, the lack of sand has hurt business the past two years. Resorts Casino Hotel has had a usable beach every year except this one, said Mark Giannantonio, the casino's president.",
      "\u201cYou have thousands of people here on a nice summer day and there\u2019s no beach for them to go on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt affects every business from the largest casino to the smallest pizzeria.\u201d",
      "The Hard Rock, Ocean and Resorts casinos are in the most heavily eroded section of Atlantic City's beach and they pushed federal officials to expedite the project.",
      "In 2023, Ocean decided it simply couldn't wait any longer, and spent $600,000 of its own money to truck sand onto the beach in front of the casino.",
      "But that sand quickly washed away, and Ocean's beach was even smaller this summer.",
      "\u201cFor a destination resort, which is what we present ourselves as, it\u2019s absolutely imperative to have a beach,\u201d said Bill Callahan, Ocean\u2019s general manager. \u201cIt affects us when people come down and see that it\u2019s not here.\"",
      "Most of project involves widening beaches in the most heavily eroded north end of Atlantic City, although portions of neighboring Ventnor will be included as well. And in the nearby beach towns of Margate and Longport, repairs are planned for dunes, sand fencing, access paths and crossovers, and dune grass will be planted.",
      "The work should be completed in two to four months, the Army Corps said.",
      "Further north, beach replenishment is also ongoing in Harvey Cedars, Beach Haven and Long Beach Township on Long Beach Island.",

      "Canadian officials are blasting President-elect Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s threat to impose sweeping tariffs",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian officials on Tuesday blasted President-elect Donald's Trump's threat to impose sweeping tariffs, as the leader of the country's most populous province called Trump's comparison of Canada to Mexico \u201cthe most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d",
      "Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico and China as soon as he takes office in January as part of efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\u201cTo compare us to Mexico is the most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever heard from our friends and closest allies, the United States of America,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \u201cI found his comments unfair. I found them insulting. It\u2019s like a family member stabbing you right in the heart.\"",
      "Ford said Canada will have no choice but to retaliate.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will convene an emergency meeting with provincial leaders on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar weakened sharply in foreign exchange markets.",
      "Trudeau said he spoke with Trump after his threat of tariffs. \u201cWe talked about the intense and effective connections between our countries that flow back and forth. We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trump made the threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern U.S. border have been near four-year lows.",
      "Apprehension numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t confuse the Mexican border with the Canadian border,\u201d Canadian Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "\"It\u2019s the equivalent to a significant weekend at the Mexico border,\u201d Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said, adding that Canada is considering a number of border measures including additional resources.",
      "Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault acknowledged that the issue along the Mexican border is far worse but called Trump's concerns legitimate, citing a recent increase in illegal immigrants entering the U.S. from Canada.",
      "\u201cA 25% tariff would mean tens of thousands of jobs lost,\u201d Legault said. \u201cWe cannot start a war. We have to do everything we can to not have these tariffs.\"",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is investing in for national security.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, we need them and they also need us,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said. \u201cCanada is the largest market for the U.S in the world, larger than China, Japan, the U.K. and France combined. It is also the case that the things we sell to the United States are the things they really need.\"",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term, countries responded with retaliatory tariffs. Canada announced billions of dollars in new duties in 2018 in response to new U.S. taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "Now, again, Canadians are particularly worried about auto tariffs. The North American auto industry is highly integrated, and parts made in Canada often go to cars manufactured in the U.S. and sold back to Canadians.",
      "\u201cTo try and undo it with a tariff would be like trying to separate the yolks from the whites in a omelet. You cannot,\u201d said Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association. \u201cYou cannot hurt Canadian automotive without immediately hurting American automotive.\"",
      "The tariffs would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump with Canada and Mexico that replaced NAFTA. It is up for review in 2026."

      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technolog...",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technology that the Biden administration already uses to help make crucial decisions in tracking, detaining and ultimately deporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status.",
      "While immigration officials have used the tech for years, an October letter from the Department of Homeland Security obtained exclusively by The Associated Press details how those tools \u2014 some of them powered by AI \u2014 help make decisions over whether an immigrant should be detained or surveilled.",
      "One algorithm, for example, ranks immigrants with a \u201cHurricane Score,\u201d ranging from 1-5, to assess whether someone will \u201cabscond\u201d from the agency's supervision.",
      "The letter, sent by DHS Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen to the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law, revealed that the score calculates the potential risk that an immigrant \u2014 with a pending case \u2014 will fail to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The algorithm relies on several factors, he said, including an immigrant\u2019s number of violations and length of time in the program, and whether the person has a travel document. Hysen wrote that ICE officers consider the score, among other information, when making decisions about an immigrant\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cThe Hurricane Score does not make decisions on detention, deportation, or surveillance; instead, it is used to inform human decision-making,\u201d Hysen wrote.",
      "Also included in the government\u2019s tool kit is a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial matching and can track an immigrant\u2019s specific location.",
      "Nearly 200,000 people without legal status who are in removal proceedings are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention program, under which certain immigrants can live in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "In exchange, SmartLINK and GPS trackers used by ICE rigorously surveil them and their movements. The phone application draws on facial matching technology and geolocation data, which has been used before to find and arrest those using the app.",
      "Just Futures Law wrote to Hysen earlier this year, questioning the fairness of using an algorithm to assess whether someone is a flight risk and raising concerns over how much data SmartLINK collects. Such AI systems, which score or screen people, are used widely but remain largely unregulated even though some have been found to discriminate on race, gender or other protected traits.",
      "DHS said in an email that it is committed to ensuring that its use of AI is transparent and safeguards privacy and civil rights while avoiding biases. The agency said it is working to implement the Biden administration\u2019s requirements on using AI, but Hysen said in his letter that security officials may waive those requirements for certain uses. Trump has publicly vowed to repeal Biden's AI policy when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cDHS uses AI to assist our personnel in their work, but DHS does not use the outputs of AI systems as the sole basis for any law enforcement action or denial of benefits,\u201d a spokesperson for DHS told the AP.",
      "Trump has not revealed how he plans to carry out his promised deportation of an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Although he has proposed invoking wartime powers, as well as military involvement, the plan would face major logistical challenges \u2014 such as where to keep those who have been detained and how to find people spread across the country \u2014 that AI-powered surveillance tools could potentially address.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer questions about how the incoming administration plans to use DHS\u2019 tech, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation\u201d in American history.",
      "Over 100 civil society groups sent a letter on Friday urging the Office of Management and Budget to require DHS to comply with the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines. A spokesperson for OMB said that agencies must align their AI tools with the guidelines by December 1, and that any extensions or waivers of that deadline will be publicly disclosed next month.",
      "Just Futures Law\u2019s executive director, Paromita Shah, said if immigrants are scored as flight risks, they are more likely to remain in detention, \"limiting their ability to prepare a defense in their case in immigration court, which is already difficult enough as it is.\u201d",
      "SmartLINK, part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison company The GEO Group. The GEO Group also contracts with ICE to run detention centers.",
      "ICE is tight-lipped about how it uses SmartLINK\u2019s location feature to find and arrest immigrants. Still, public records show that during Trump\u2019s first term in 2018, Manassas, Virginia-based employees of BI Inc. relayed immigrants\u2019 GPS locations to federal authorities, who then arrested over 40 people.",
      "In a report last year to address privacy issues and concerns, DHS said that the mobile app includes security features that \u201cprohibit access to information on the participant\u2019s mobile device, with the exception of location data points when the app is open.\u201d",
      "But the report notes that there remains a risk that data collected from people \"may be misused for unauthorized persistent monitoring.\u201d",
      "Such information could also be stored in other ICE and DHS databases and used for other DHS mission purposes, the report said.",
      "On investor calls earlier this month, private prison companies were clear-eyed about the opportunities ahead.",
      "The GEO Group\u2019s executive chairman George Christopher Zoley said that he expects the incoming Trump administration to \u201ctake a much more aggressive approach regarding border security as well as interior enforcement and to request additional funding from Congress to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn GEO\u2019s ISAP program, we can scale up from the present 182,500 participants to several hundreds of thousands, or even millions of participants,\u201d Zoley said.",
      "That same day, the head of another private prison company told investors he would be watching closely to see how the new administration may change immigrant monitoring programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for multiple vendors to engage ICE about the program going forward and think about creative and innovative solutions to not only get better outcomes, but also scale up the program as necessary,\u201d Damon Hininger, CEO of the private prison company CoreCivic Inc. said on an earnings call.",
      "GEO did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, CoreCivic said that it has played \u201ca valued but limited role in America\u2019s immigration system\u201d for both Democrats and Republicans for over 40 years."

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:42:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
      "ATLANTA -- President Joe Biden's administration announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy will make a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian Automotive to build a factory in Georgia that had stalled as the startup electric vehicle maker struggled to become profitable.",
      "It's unclear whether the administration can complete the loan before Donald Trump becomes president again in less than two months, or whether the Trump administration might try to claw the money back.",
      "Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles and $4,000 for used ones.",
      "Rivian made a splash when it went public and began producing large electric R1 SUVs, pickup trucks and delivery vans at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, in 2021. Months later, the California-based company announced it would build a second, larger, $5 billion plant about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Atlanta, near the town of Social Circle.",
      "The R1 vehicles cost $70,000 or more. The company plans to produce R2 vehicles, a smaller SUV, in Georgia with lower price tags aimed at a mass market. The first phase of Rivian\u2019s Georgia factory is projected to make 200,000 vehicles a year, with a second phase capable of another 200,000 a year. Eventually, the plant is projected to employ 7,500 workers.",
      "But Rivian was unable to meet production and sales targets and rapidly burned through cash. In March, the company said it would pause construction of the Georgia plant. The company said it would begin assembling its R2 SUV in Illinois instead.",
      "CEO RJ Scaringe said the move would allow Rivian to start selling the R2 sooner and save $2.25 billion in capital spending. Since then, German automaker Volkswagen AG said in June it would invest $5 billion in Rivian in a joint venture in which Rivian would share software and electrical technology with Volkswagen. The money eased Rivian's cash crunch.",
      "Tuesday's announcement throws a lifeline to Rivian's grander plans. The company said its plans to make the R2 and the smaller R3 in Georgia are back on and that production will begin in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,\u201d Scaringe said in a statement.",
      "The Energy Department said the loan would substantially boost electric vehicles made in the United States and support Biden\u2019s goal of having zero-emission vehicles make up half of all new U.S. sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cAs one of a few American EV startups with light duty vehicles already on the road, Rivian\u2019s Georgia facility will allow the company to reach production volumes that make its products more cost competitive and accelerate access to international markets,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "The loan includes $6 billion, plus $600 million in interest that will be rolled into the principal. The money would come from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to make fuel-efficient vehicles and components. The program has focused mostly on loans to new battery factories for electric vehicles under Biden, but earlier helped finance initial production of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, two pioneering electric vehicles.",
      "The loan program, created in 2007, requires a \"reasonable prospect of repayment\" of the loan. Under Biden, the program has announced deals totaling $33.3 billion, including $9.2 billion for massive battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky for Ford\u2019s electric vehicles.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who has been a vocal supporter of electric vehicle and solar manufacturing in Georgia, hailed Tuesday's announcement as \u201cyet another historic federal investment in Georgia electric vehicle manufacturing.\u201d Ossoff had asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to support the loan in July.",
      "\u201cOur federal manufacturing incentives are driving economic development across the state of Georgia,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp says his goal is to make Georgia a center of the electric vehicle industry. But the Republican has had a strained relationship with the Biden administration over its industrial policy, even as some studies have found Georgia has netted more electric vehicle investment than any other state.",
      "Kemp has long claimed that manufacturers were picking Georgia before Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, was passed.",
      "Efforts to bring Rivian to Georgia predated the Biden administration and \"our shared vision to bring opportunity to Georgia will remain no matter who resides in the White House or what party controls Congress,\u201d Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said Tuesday.",
      "The loan to Rivian could rescue one of the Kemp administration's signature economic development projects even as Biden leaves office. That could put Rivian and Kemp in the position of defending the loan if Trump tries to quash it.",
      "State and local governments offered Rivian an incentive package worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 2022. Neighbors opposed to development of the Georgia site mounted legal challenges.",
      "State and local governments spent around $125 million to buy and prepare the nearly 2,000-acre (810-hectare) site. The state also has completed most of $50 million in roadwork that it pledged.",
      "The pause at Rivian contrasts with rapid construction at Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex near Savannah. The Korean automaker said in October that it had begun production in Ellabell, where it plans to eventually employ 8,500.",

      "A senior official in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration who oversaw its contentious efforts to address climate change by curbing drilling and mining on federal lands has been named the next president of a prominent environmental group",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- A senior official in President Joe Biden's administration who oversaw its contentious efforts to address climate change by curbing oil drilling and coal mining on federal lands while expanding renewable power was named Tuesday as the next president of a prominent environmental group.",
      "U.S. Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning will become president of The Wilderness Society effective next February, the Washington, D.C.-based group announced.",
      "The land bureau shifted sharply away from fossil fuel extraction during her tenure, including two decisions released Tuesday that end new federal coal sales from the nation's most productive reserves of the fuel along the Wyoming-Montana border.",
      "Stone-Manning's 2021 nomination by Biden was bitterly opposed by Republicans who labeled her an \u201ceco-terrorist\u201d over her past ties with environmental extremists. Senate Democrats pushed through her confirmation on a party-line vote.",
      "The land bureau has jurisdiction over almost a quarter-billion acres (100 million hectares) of land, primarily in western states, that is used for oil exploration, mining, livestock grazing, recreation and other purposes.",
      "Under Stone-Manning the bureau sharply reduced oil and gas lease sales and raised royalty rates that companies must pay to extract the fuel. It also issued a rule elevating the importance of conservation, by making it a \u201cuse\u201d of public lands on par with drilling or grazing.",
      "That marked a sharp departure from the land bureau's longstanding reputation for favoring commercial development over environmental preservation.",
      "The moves drew pushback from the energy, mining and ranching industries and Republican in Congress. They have vowed to undo actions taken by Stone-Manning when the GOP assumes control in Washington next year as a result of its 2024 election wins.",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said the decision to end coal leasing in the Powder River Basin area of northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana would have devastating economic effects. The Republican accused the Biden administration of a \u201ccrusade\u201d against coal and said he would work with his state's congressional delegation to reverse it.",
      "\u201cThis is not a balanced resource management strategy, but an anti-fossil fuel, politically-motivated action taken before the door slams on this administration,\u201d Gordon said in a statement.",
      "The land bureau under Biden also approved new solar and wind power projects and opened more public lands to renewable energy development.",
      "It is uncertain if the changes will last.",
      "Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, praised the work done by Stone-Manning on renewable energy, but added that it could be \u201ccompletely undone\u201d by the next administration.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s through rock-bottom royalty rates, rigged rulemaking, or stripped environmental protections, our public lands will soon be a profit playground for the rich,\u201d said Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to drop Biden\u2019s climate and energy policies in a bid to increase oil and gas production that is already at record levels. He has nominated North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Interior Department, which includes the Bureau of Land Management. Oil industry representatives and Republicans from energy states cheered Burgum\u2019s nomination.",
      "Before joining the administration, Stone-Manning worked as a senior aide to Montana Democrats U.S. Sen. Jon Tester and Gov. Steve Bullock. Her nomination by Biden sparked intense Republican opposition because of Stone-Manning's involvement in a 1989 environmental sabotage case.",
      "As a 23-year-old graduate student at the University of Montana, Stone-Manning sent a letter to federal officials in 1989 saying spikes had been inserted into trees in an Idaho national forest, a tactic sometimes used to halt timber sales.",
      "Two men were criminally charged, and Stone-Manning testified against them. She was given immunity and never charged with crimes, although an investigator later said she had stonewalled the probe.",
      "After Tester and moderate Sen. Joe Manchin defended her, Stone-Manning was confirmed on a 50-45 vote.",
      "The bureau's headquarters were relocated to Colorado under Trump and hundreds of employees resigned or retired before it was returned to Washington, D.C., under Biden.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's chief of staff, Rachael Taylor, said in a statement that Stone-Manning had reshaped the bureau after it was \u201cdamaged\u201d by the relocation. Taylor said Stone-Manning also helped restore balance to public lands decisions and made sure Native American tribes have a role in managing their homelands.",
      "Trump has not announced his nominee to lead the land bureau. During the Republican's first-term, it went without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump instead used acting directors who did not have to go before the Senate to advance his policies."

      "Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, reported another quarterly drop in sales as Americans continued to tighten their purse strings on appliances and gadgets to focus on essentials",
      "NEW YORK -- Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, reported another quarterly drop in sales as Americans continued to tighten their purse strings on appliances and gadgets to focus on essentials.",
      "The Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer lowered its annual sales and profit outlook. Best Buy\u2019s CEO Corie Barry also warned that shoppers will likely have to pay more for purchases reflecting higher costs as President-elect Donald Trump pledges to impose sweeping tariffs on products from China and Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, Kohl's posted third-quarter results that showed a deepening slump and forecast that sales declines for the year will be worse than expected. The results came one day after the Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retailer announced that Michaels CEO and retail veteran Ashley Buchanan will take over its top job, effective Jan. 15.",
      "Best Buy's shares were down nearly 8% in afternoon trading, while Kohl's shares plummeted nearly 19%.",
      "As the last batch of major retailers report third-quarter earnings results this week, winners and losers are emerging at the approach of Black Friday, the official start of the holiday shopping season.",
      "Macy\u2019s reported on Monday stronger-than-expected sales for the third quarter, and said it\u2019s delaying the release of its full quarterly results, set for Tuesday, after it discovered an employee intentionally hid up to $154 million of expenses over several years.",
      "Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, last week reported another quarter of stellar sales as its low price model proved a powerful draw for inflationary-weary shoppers. But Target, whose business relies on discretionary purchases like clothing and accessories, reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as customers curtailed their spending on non-essentials.",
      "During a call with analysts Tuesday, Best Buy's Barry said the chain wrestled with economic uncertainty, shoppers' waiting for deals and the disruption during the run-up to the election, particularly in non-essential categories. Sales are rebounding, but Barry noted that the season will be very promotional.",
      "Best Buy kicked off Black Friday sales on Nov. 21, a week earlier than last year. It's also bringing back doorbusters \u2014 limited-time-only deals on specific products \u2014 every Friday from Nov. 8 through Dec. 20 online, in the store and on the app.",
      "\u201cWe are managing well what we can control in what remains a volatile environment,\u201d Barry said on the call.",
      "Like other retailers, Best Buy is also bracing for Trump's threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "Barry said the company believes that diversification of sourcing in consumer electronics is a \u201cgood thing but it\u2019s also very hard to do.\u201d The supply network is complex as well as the fabrication plants for consumer gadgets, she said.",
      "Moreover, Best Buy has very little control of sourcing, directly importing only about 2% to 3% of its cost of goods sold, she said. The majority of that has been moved out of China.",
      "But Barry says the retailer is reliant on its vendors and estimates that 60% of the company\u2019s cost of goods sold come from China. The second-largest importing country is Mexico.",
      "Best Buy has a team looking at how tariffs will impact its business, but she said that the retailer operates on very thin profit margins. So while vendors and the company will shoulder some costs, Best Buy will have to pass on much of the higher costs of the tariffs to its customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\u201cThese are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\u201d Barry said.",
      "Best Buy earned $273 million, or $1.26 per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 2. That compares with $263 million, or $1.21 per share, a year ago. Sales fell to $9.45 billion from $9.76 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $1.30 per share on sales of $9.63 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Comparable sales \u2014 those sales from online channels and physical stores \u2014 fell 2.9% in the quarter.",
      "The company said that sales of appliances, home theater and gaming declined. That was partially offset by growth in the computing, tablets and services categories.",
      "Best Buy now expects annual sales in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.5 billion, down from prior guidance of $41.3 billion to $41.9 billion. Analysts anticipated $41.54 billion, according to FactSet analysts.",

      "NEW YORK -- Walmart's sweeping rollback of its diversity policies is the strongest indication yet of a profound shift taking hold at U.S. companies that are re-evaluating the legal and political risks associated with bold programs to bolster historically underrepresented groups.",
      "The changes announced by the world's biggest retailer on Monday followed a string of legal victories by conservative groups that have filed an onslaught of lawsuits challenging corporate and federal programs aimed at elevating minority and women-owned businesses and employees.",
      "The retreat from such programs crystalized with the election of former President Donald Trump, whose administration is certain to make dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs a priority. Trump's incoming deputy chief of policy will be his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has aggressively challenged corporate DEI policies.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of reassessment of risk looking at programs that could be deemed to constitute reverse discrimination,\u201d said Allan Schweyer, principal researcher at the Human Capital Center at the Conference Board.",
      "\u201cThis is another domino to fall and it is a rather large domino,\u201d he added.",
      "Among other changes, Walmart said it will no longer give priority treatment to suppliers owned by women or minorities. The company also will not renew a five-year commitment for a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. And it pulled out of a prominent gay rights index.",
      "Schweyer said the biggest trigger for companies making such changes is simply a reassessment of their legal risk exposure, which began after U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June 2023 that ended affirmative action in college admissions. Since then, conservative groups using similar arguments have secured court victories against various diversity programs, especially those that steer contracts to minority or women-owned businesses.",
      "Most recently, the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty won a victory in a case against the U.S. Department of Transportation over its use of a program that gives priority to minority-owned businesses when it awards contracts.",
      "Companies are seeing a big legal risk in continuing with DEI efforts, said Dan Lennington, a deputy counsel at the institute. His organization says it has identified more than 60 programs in the federal government that it considers discriminatory, he said.",
      "\u201cWe have a legal landscape within the entire federal government, all three branches -- the U.S. Supreme Court, the Congress and the President -- are all now firmly pointed in the direction towards equality of individuals and individualized treatment of all Americans, instead of diversity, equity and inclusion treating people as members of racial groups,\u201d Lennington said.",
      "The Trump administration is also likely to take direct aim at DEI initiatives through executive orders and other policies that affect private companies, especially federal contractors.",
      "\u201cThe impact of the election on DEI policies is huge. It can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, co-chair of the Labor & Employment Practice Group at law firm Gibson Dunn.",
      "With Miller returning to the White House, rolling back DEI initiatives is likely to be a priority, Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cCompanies are trying to strike the right balance to make clear they\u2019ve got an inclusive workplace where everyone is welcome, and they want to get the best talent, while at the same time trying not to alienate various parts of their employees and customer base who might feel one way or the other. It\u2019s a virtually impossible dilemma,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "A recent survey by Pew Research Center showed that workers are divided on the merits of DEI policies. While still broadly popular, the share of workers who said focusing on workplace diversity was mostly a good thing fell to 52% in the October survey, compared to 56% in a similar survey in February 2023. Rachel Minkin, a research associate at Pew, called it a small but significant shift in short amount of time.",
      "There will be more companies pulling back from their DEI policies, but it likely won\u2019t be a retreat across the board, said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at New York University.",
      "\u201cThere are vastly more companies that are sticking with DEI,\" Glasgow said. \"The only reason you don\u2019t hear about it is most of them are doing it by stealth. They\u2019re putting their heads down and doing DEI work and hoping not to attract attention.\u201d",
      "Glasgow advises organizations to stick to their own core values, because attitudes toward the topic can change quickly in the span of four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to leave them looking a little bit weak if there\u2019s a kind of flip-flopping, depending on whichever direction the political winds are blowing,\u201d he said.",
      "One reason DEI programs exist is because without those programs, companies may be vulnerable to lawsuits for traditional discrimination. \u201cReally think carefully about the risks in all directions on this topic,\u201d Glasgow said.",
      "Walmart confirmed will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. Walmart says its U.S. businesses sourced more than $13 billion in goods and services from diverse suppliers in fiscal year 2024, including businesses owned by minorities, women and veterans.",
      "It was unclear how its relationships with such business would change going forward. Organizations that have partnered with Walmart on its diversity initiatives offered a cautious response.",
      "The Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council, a non-profit that last year named Walmart one of America's top corporation for women-owned enterprises, said it was still evaluating the impact of Walmart's announcement.",
      "Pamela Prince-Eason, the president and CEO of the organization, said she hoped Walmart's need to cater to its diverse customer base will continue to drive contracts to women-owned suppliers even if the company has no explicit dollar goals.",
      "\u201cI suspect Walmart will continue to have one of the most inclusive supply chains in the World,\u201d Prince-Eason wrote. \u201cAny retailer's ability to serve the communities they operate in will continue to value understanding their customers, (many of which are women), in order to better provide products and services desired and no one understands customers better than Walmart.\"",
      "Walmart's announcement came after the company spoke directly with conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck, who has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe\u2019s and Tractor Supply.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don\u2019t feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. The company also will stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson added that some of the changes were already in progress and not as a result of conversations that it had with Starbuck.",
      "RaShawn \u201cShawnie\u201d Hawkins, senior director of the HRC Foundation\u2019s Workplace Equality Program, said companies that \u201cabandon\u201d their commitments workplace inclusion policies \u201care shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders.\u201d She said the buying power of LGBTQ customers is powerful and noted that the index will have record participation of more than 1,400 companies in 2025."

      "NEW YORK -- Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won\u2019t be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe's and Tractor Supply.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\u201d Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he had been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don\u2019t feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youth who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it is not financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion is not next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and will not do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \u201caddress the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who has criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it has been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \u201cbelonging.\u201d It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",
      "Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying that DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream."

      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

      "The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index ticked up to 111.7 from 109.6 in October. The small increase followed a big gain in October.",
      "Rising consumer confidence suggests Americans may spend more in the coming months, which would help boost economic growth. Yet Americans have been spending at a healthy clip for much of the past two years even as confidence measures have been low, a sign that sentiment surveys may not be as useful a guide to the economy's direction as they were in the past.",
      "The uptick comes after President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Conference Board doesn't break out its responses by party, but another measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan showed that optimism about the economy jumped among Republicans after the election.",
      "In the Conference Board's report, the proportion of Americans who anticipate a recession in the next 12 months fell to the lowest level since the group first began asking the question in July 2022. And consumers' optimism about future hiring rose to its highest level in nearly three years.",
      "The survey found that Americans' expectations for future inflation fell to its lowest level since March 2020, nearly a year before consumer prices began rising quickly. When asked about their hopes for 2025, \u201cconsumers overwhelmingly selected higher prices as their top concern and lower prices as their top wish for the new year,\u201d the Conference Board said.",
      "The report comes just hours after President-elect Donald Trump said he would impose stiff 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on imports from China. Economists and some retailers warn that such duties, if enacted, would be inflationary.",

      "Treasury officials warn of dire consequences if the funding is effectively rescinded through inaction. The loss of that money would lead to an increase of the national deficit by $140 billion, Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on a call to reporters on Tuesday. There would be 6,000 fewer audits of wealthy individuals and 2,000 fewer audits of large corporations, and the agency would have to go on a hiring freeze, he said.",
      "\u201cThe IRS is going to potentially have to make dramatic decisions about stopping hiring and starting to budget for a world which they don't have $20 billion which will stop a lot of their progress,\u201d Adeyemo said. \u201dIf they don't get that $20 billion that is at risk they would run out of enforcement money at the current pace sometime in fiscal year 2025.\"",

      "The EU and the South American trade bloc Mercosur are working to finalize a trade deal that has been in negotiation for over 20 years",
      "PARIS -- After more than 20 years of negotiations, the 27-nation European Union and Mercosur \u2014 a South American trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia \u2014 are still trying to finalize a major trade agreement that is sparking protests by European farmers.",
      "A draft deal was announced in 2019, but disagreements over environmental, economic and political issues are delaying its final approval.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the deal, why it matters, and challenges it faces:",
      "It aims to create one of the largest free trade zones in the world, covering over 700 million people and nearly 25% of global GDP. Much like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, its goal is to reduce tariffs and trade barriers, making it easier for businesses on both sides to export goods.",
      "For the EU, the deal would mean lower tariffs on products like cars, machinery and chemicals. Mercosur countries would benefit from better access to EU markets for agricultural exports such as beef, poultry and sugar.",
      "Negotiations began in 1999 and an initial agreement was reached in 2019, but it remains unratified due to significant opposition, particularly from France.",
      "European farmers, especially in France, worry that an influx of South American products would saturate their markets, undercutting local agriculture.",
      "One year after a massive European farmers\u2019 protest movement, another round of protests have erupted across the continent, with many claiming that reduced tariffs or duty-free quotas for South American products could be fatal for them.",
      "For example, 99,000 tons of beef would face a reduced tariff of just 7.5%, while 180,000 tons of poultry would enter duty-free. According to the European Commission, this accounts for less than 2% of the EU\u2019s annual beef consumption.",
      "Livestock farmers argue they cannot compete with South American producers, who benefit from lower labor costs, larger farms and less stringent regulations on practices such as the use of growth hormones compared to EU standards.",
      "In October, a European Commission audit found that Brazil, the world\u2019s largest exporter of beef, cannot guarantee that its exports to the EU are free of the growth hormone \u201coestradiol 17-\u03b2,\u201d which has been banned in Europe for decades.",
      "Germany, Spain, Italy and Portugal are among EU countries pushing for the deal to be finalized by year's end. Germany, in particular, sees Mercosur as a key market for its automakers.",
      "In South America, leaders like Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva view the agreement as a boost for regional trade and economic growth. Countries like Uruguay and Paraguay also support the deal, hoping to diversify their trade partners and reduce reliance on China. Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei has also backed it, signaling a shift from his predecessor\u2019s skepticism.",
      "The deal is also backed by industries in both regions. European carmakers and pharmaceutical companies see it as a way to access Mercosur\u2019s growing markets.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has also expressed strong support, calling it \u201can agreement of great economic and strategic importance\u201d \u2014 despite opposition from certain EU member states.",
      "France, with the biggest agriculture sector in Europe, has led opposition within the EU, along with Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for stronger environmental and labor standards, stating that \u201cFrance would not sign the deal as is.\"",
      "France has also requested that the European Commission renegotiate the text, particularly by incorporating \u201cmirror clauses,\u201d which would impose identical standards on products traded between the two blocs.",
      "However, France\u2019s ability to block the deal is limited, as trade talks fall under the authority of the European Commission, which negotiates for the 27 member states.",
      "Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have also criticized the deal, warning it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon and increase the use of harmful pesticides.",
      "The Mercosur summit on Dec. 5-6 in Uruguay could be a key moment for the deal. However, even if the agreement is signed, it must be ratified by all 27 EU member states, the European Parliament and all member states\u2019 national parliaments before taking effect.",
      "This would give France a chance to veto it.",
      "To speed up and make approval easier, the European Commission is considering splitting the deal into two parts: a broader cooperation agreement and a trade-focused agreement. The latter would only require a majority vote under EU rules, bypassing the need for unanimous approval.",
      "Under this plan, France would lose its veto power unless it can gather enough support to form a blocking minority. While countries like Poland and Austria have raised objections, their combined influence falls short of the threshold needed to halt the deal."

      "The Massachusetts-based tech company, whose scanners have also been used at sports stadiums and schools, has faced allegations of misconduct. Last month, Evolv\u2019s board of directors fired its chief executive following an internal investigation that found certain sales had been \u201csubject to extra-contractual terms and conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, the company announced it had resolved a previous probe launched by the Federal Trade Commission last year over allegations of deceptive marketing practices. The company is also under separate investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Despite the legal and regulatory scrutiny, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced a pilot program this summer to bring a handful of scanners to the city's subways to deter gun violence. The initiative drew immediate criticism from civil liberties groups who said the searches were unconstitutional, along with questions about its efficacy.",
      "In October, the city revealed the scanners did not detect any passengers with firearms \u2014 but falsely alerted more than 100 times.",
      "At the time, a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said it was still \u201cevaluating the outcome of the pilot\u201d and had not entered into any contract with Evolv."

      "Adversity finds every team in the NBA at some point",
      "Adversity finds every team in the NBA at some point. Somebody is going to get injured or sick, guaranteed. How those stretches are handled can make or break a season.",
      "Orlando and San Antonio are finding a way right now.",
      "New Orleans and Philadelphia are among the teams that aren't.",
      "The Magic have gone 9-1 in their last 10 games, all without an injured Paolo Banchero \u2014 the team's best player and an All-Star last season. They are behind only Cleveland and Boston, another pair of teams that haven't let injury issues keep them from sizzling starts, in the Eastern Conference. The Spurs have gone 7-5 since Gregg Popovich had a stroke that left assistant coach Mitch Johnson serving as acting coach.",
      "Those two teams might be the best examples early on of how not to let adversity impede winning.",
      "\u201cMitch is really smart, great teammate in the coaches room,\" said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, a close friend of Popovich and someone who spent time with Johnson through USA Basketball in recent summers \u2014 including camps in Las Vegas before the 2023 World Cup and this year's Paris Olympics. \"He was a big part of all of our conversations pre- and post-practice. He\u2019s a really good coach, good guy. I know Pop loves him and feels very strongly what a good coach he is.\"",
      "It's showing. The last time the Spurs \u2014 who have also been without starting forward Jeremy Sochan in recent weeks and played a couple games without star center Victor Wembanyama \u2014 had a better record through 17 games was in the 2017-18 season.",
      "Johnson has done an impressive job of holding things together through a tough time.",
      "\u201cYou look across the league, there\u2019s a lot of injuries and guys out, so it\u2019s just something where you\u2019re trying to prepare everybody and it\u2019s the next man up,\" Johnson said. \"But it\u2019s nice to see everybody embrace that, not only for themselves but for their teammates.\u201d",
      "The Magic, predictably, went through a struggle phase after Banchero got hurt: They started 0-4 without him, losing those games by an average of 14.3 points. And then Franz Wagner \u2014 who should be headed to San Francisco for the All-Star Game \u2014 took an enormous leap forward, averaging 27.6 points in his last 11 games.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s found another level of confidence, and we need it,\u201d Magic forward Jonathan Isaac said. \u201cYou know, obviously with Paolo going down, he\u2019s stepped up and he recognizes what this team needs. We need him to be aggressive and just score the basketball. I think he\u2019s just stepped into that role, and he\u2019s been dominant, he\u2019s been confident, and doing his thing.\u201d",
      "The Magic have made playing without a star look easy. It's not. Take the Phoenix Suns \u2014 they're 8-1 with Kevin Durant, 1-6 without him. Durant is probable to return Tuesday night from a calf strain when the Suns take on the Los Angeles Lakers.",
      "Memphis is an example of weathering the storm: The Grizzlies went 5-3 in Ja Morant's eight-game absence that ended Monday night.",
      "The Pelicans aren't missing just one big name. They've been decimated by injuries: Dejounte Murray missed his 17th game Monday night with a broken left hand and three other Pelicans \u2014 Zion Williamson, CJ McCollum and Herb Jones \u2014 have all missed at least 12 games while being hurt. It's why New Orleans is 4-14, one of the worst starts in the league.",
      "\u201cWe're going to figure it out, and fight and claw like we normally do,\u201d Pelicans forward Trey Murphy said.",
      "The 76ers say they'll do the same, but they've been missing plenty of their best fighters \u2014 with Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Kyle Lowry among those all missing time because of injury.",
      "The result is a 3-13 start, the second-worst record in the NBA. The only silver lining for Philadelphia right now is that it's in the East, where only four teams have winning records right now.",
      "\u201cWe're 16 games in. It's a long season,\" Maxey said. \u201cEither we're going to lay down and let teams come in here and have field days against us, or we're going to go out there and play with some pride and go out there and win some games.",
      "\u201cWe get it,\u201d he added. \"I got hurt. Jo got hurt. Kyle got hurt. P got hurt. Guys are in and out of the lineup. Yes, we understand that. That's not ideal. But all of us can do one thing every single night, 1 through 15, go out there, know the game plan and play extremely hard, every single night.\u201d",
      "Such is the adversity part. The Spurs and Magic seem to have figured it out. The Pelicans and 76ers are among those still searching for answers.",

      "Swinney has long thought the landscape of the game has been unmanageable with schools with bigger donor bases and better-funded collectives having an advantage over schools like Clemson, which is not quite as well funded.",

It's \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d meets \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d with the stage being the field and the grand prize a chance to compete for a spot on a national team. Because it\u2019s never too early to start planning for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where flag football will make its Summer Games debut.",
      "Know this, though \u2014 it's not an easy team to make. The men's and women's national team rosters are at \u201cDream Team\u201d status given the men\u2019s side has captured six of the last seven world championships and the women three in a row. To remain on top, the sport's national governing body is scouring every football field, park, track, basketball court and gym to find hidden talent to cultivate.",

      "Flag football was one of five new sports added to the LA28 program. The already soaring profile of American football only figures to be enhanced by an Olympic appearance. Imagine, say, a few familiar faces take the field, too. Perhaps even NFL stars such as Tyreek Hill or Patrick Mahomes, maybe even past pro football greats donning a flag belt for a country to which they may have ties.",
      "Soon after flag football's inclusion, there was chatter of NFL players possibly joining in on the fun. Of course, there are logistical issues to tackle before their inclusion at the LA Olympics, which open July 14, 2028.",

      "COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Texas and Texas A&M first met on the football field in 1894 in a rivalry that would cut across the state and through families for generations.",
      "But a bitter breakup would eventually come between them.",
      "In 2011, Texas A&M announced it was leaving Texas and the Big 12 behind to join the Southeastern Conference, determined to focus only on a bright future, not dwell on a sentimental past.",
      "Resentful finger pointing and hard feelings eventually gave way to shrugs of indifference and mutters of \u201cgood riddance.\"",
      "Thirteen years later, the family feud has reignited. Texas is playing in the SEC this season, and the No. 3 Longhorns and No. 20 Aggies finally meet again Saturday night in College Station with new intensity: A berth in the SEC championship game is on the line.",
      "\u201cI've missed this. It's too good of a game not to play,\u201d said Dan Neil, a former Texas All-American offensive lineman who played in the rivalry from 1992-1996.",
      "Neil called the breakup a \u201cshame.\u201d Former Texas quarterback Case McCoy, whose crazy-legs scramble set up the Longhorns' game-winning field goal in 2011, was more blunt about the lost years of a treasured rivalry.",
      "\u201cI feel like it was stolen from the last generation of football players,\u201d McCoy said.",
      "The split came amid a tumultuous period of conference realignment across the country that had Texas in the middle of it all.",
      "The Big 12 had already lost Colorado to the Pac-12 and Nebraska to the Big Ten. Texas had also flirted with joining the Pac-12 and taking longtime rival Oklahoma and other Big 12 schools with it. Texas A&M meanwhile, briefly looked eastward toward the SEC.",
      "The boat was still rocking a year later when Texas and ESPN effectively flipped it over with a 20-year, $300 million deal to launch the now-defunct Longhorn Network. Big 12 rivals bitterly complained the swaggering Longhorns were stomping over the rest of the league.",
      "The Aggies had enough. The two schools played in the same conference since 1915, but A&M saw a chance to strike out on its own. The SEC was the most powerful football conference in the country and promised more money and more respect and a big leap out of Texas' shadow.",
      "When Texas A&M informed the Big 12 it was leaving, then-President R. Bowen Loftin called it a \u201c100-year decision\u201d the school had addressed \u201ccarefully and methodically.\u201d",
      "Years later, he described a simple desire to get away from Texas.",
      "\u201cA&M had to do something, something bold and something that was really meant for A&M,\u201d Loftin told the Houston Chronicle in 2021. \u201cSomething that did not necessarily link us in the future to that school in Austin.\u201d",
      "The result ripped apart a deeply-rooted state tradition. The game was as much of a Thanksgiving staple as turkey, stuffing and pecan pie.",
      "\u201cI went to Texas to play in the A&M game,\u201d said McCoy, whose family has deep roots in the rivalry. His older brother Colt was one of the greatest quarterbacks in Longhorns' program history.",
      "\u201cMy dad was a (Texas) high school football coach. My grandparents, uncles, brother, everyone has a part,\u201d of the rivalry, McCoy said. \u201cIf you were a kid growing up in Texas, it meant a lot.\"",
      "The Aggies left the Big 12 knowing a split could be coming, and said they told Texas they wanted to keep playing. Texas said its non-conference schedule was already full for several years.",
      "So as the Texas fight song says, \u201cgoodbye to A&M.\u201d For spite or schedule, a tradition was about to be lost.",
      "\u201cIt was a travesty,\u201d said former Texas running back Ricky Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1998 and set the NCAA career rushing record against the Aggies.",
      "\u201cI thought it was dumb to get rid of that game because to me that game is deeper, it\u2019s more powerful than conferences,\" Williams said.",
      "The 2011 game before the breakup was an instant classic.",
      "In a tense, back-and-forth matchup in front of a frenzied crowd in College Station, McCoy's frantic, 25-yard scramble through the heart of the defense set up Justin Tucker's 40-yard field goal as time expired.",
      "Texas' 27-25 victory on the scoreboard hung over the stunned home crowd that was unsure if it would ever be avenged.",
      "\u201cIt parted like the Red Sea,\u201d McCoy said of the A&M defense. \u201cThank God we won that game ... I married into a family that, other than my wife, is all Aggies. I live it all the time.\u201d",
      "There were passing mentions of resuming the rivalry over the years. Then in 2021, Texas and Oklahoma were officially invited to join the SEC.",
      "Texas A&M, thinking it had permanently split from the Longhorns, was stunned. The loss in 2011 was like a kick in the teeth. Texas' move to the SEC was a gut punch.",
      "Texas was initially approved for entry in 2025, then it was moved up to this year. The Aggies at least get home-field advantage and a nighttime kickoff at raucous Kyle Field for the reunion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be there at the game and my kids and family will be there,\u201d former Texas A&M All-American linebacker Dat Nguyen said. \u201cI want them to experience it and absorb it because we don\u2019t want to take it for granted. Because you never know. Hopefully, (a breakup) won\u2019t happen again.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Oklahoma appears to have borrowed from the past to cure its recent offensive ills",
      "NORMAN, Okla. -- Oklahoma appears to have borrowed from the past to cure its recent offensive ills.",
      "The Sooners, best known this century for a passing prowess that has produced four Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks, took it back to the 20th century against then-No. 7 Alabama. Oklahoma ran 50 times for 257 yards while only throwing 12 times in a 24-3 win over the Crimson Tide that took coach Brent Venables off the hot seat. The Sooners more resembled Barry Switzer\u2019s squads that dominated the old Big 8 with the wishbone offense in the 1970s and \u201980s than the more recent Air Raid teams.",
      "Venables said the change was a matter of necessity for a unit that has been besieged by injuries at receiver and offensive line.",
      "\u201cI think this staff has done a really good job with trying to figure that out, get better every week, put together a great gameplan but also figure out, \u2018OK, what does this group of guys, what does this team \u2014 what do we need to do?'\u201d Venables said.",
      "To make it work, Oklahoma needed to trust that such a change would work in the modern Southeastern Conference. They had to implement it with an interim play-caller in Joe Jon Finley, who stepped in after the Sooners fired Seth Littrell last month.",
      "Oklahoma (6-5, 2-5 SEC) pulled it off, and LSU coach Brian Kelly has taken notice ahead of their game on Saturday.",
      "\u201cThis is now much more about controlling the football, running the football, playing with physicality,\" Kelly said. \"They've got perimeter skill, but I think it's centered around much more of a run-centric, quarterback run and take care of the football.\"",
      "The Sooners started to see success on the ground against Maine. They ran 52 times for 381 yards in a 59-14 win that got the wheels turning. Jovantae Barnes ran for career highs of 203 yards and three touchdowns that day.",
      "Venables said the timing of the opportunity to play that non-conference game against Maine in early November and figure some things out was perfect.",
      "\u201cEverybody has some degree of vulnerability and maybe some self-doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd just developing some confidence and putting something on tape other than practice, like, \u2018Man, look, see what you\u2019re capable of?\u2019 And executing against, again, a well-coached team \u2014 certainly, we played off of that in all the right ways like you would expect us to. And so there\u2019s a real place for that.\u201d",
      "After a bye week, the Sooners tried the same approach against Missouri. It wasn't as successful \u2014 they ran 36 times for 122 yards \u2014 but they hung tough before losing 30-23.",
      "The Sooners went all in against Alabama. Jackson Arnold \u2014 the same guy who threw 45 times in the Alamo Bowl last year, ran 25 times for 131 yards and threw just 11 passes.",
      "The Sooners found something in running back Xavier Robinson. With Barnes out with an injury, Robinson carried 18 times for career highs of 107 yards and two touchdowns.",
      "Suddenly, a team that had been forcing the pass and getting sacked at an alarming rate was moving the line of scrimmage and controlling the tempo. Oklahoma had the ball for more than 34 minutes against the Crimson Tide, lending support to a talented defense that had been spending way too much time on the field.",

You can\u2019t just do one thing. But we need to be efficient.\u201d",

      "However, when you're coaching against your younger brother on the opposing sideline, sometimes you have to be aggressive and go all in.",
      "In the case of John Harbaugh and the Baltimore Ravens, it ended up paying off big time.",
      "Mark Andrews' 2-yard gain on a quarterback sneak not only allowed the Ravens to continue their drive, it ended up later turning into a touchdown that gave them the lead against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night.",
      "It also was the turning point in the Ravens' 30-23 victory that allowed John to remain unbeaten in three meetings against younger brother, Jim Harbaugh.",
      "\u201cThe downside is you give them the ball at the 16-yard line. That\u2019s the downside. But the upside, or the thought, is I really thought we could get it,\u201d John Harbaugh said. \"It led to a 93-yard drive and got us seven points; that was a big turning point in the game.\u201d",

      "The Ravens ended up converting the three times they went for it on fourth down. The other two came during a nearly seven-minute drive late in the third quarter and early in the fourth where Andrews caught a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone to extend the Ravens' lead to 23-16.",

      "Players on both teams last week tried to downplay the hype surrounding the Harbaugh Bowl, but the Ravens were reveling in the victory when it was over.",
      "\u201cI just know our Harbaugh is 3-0,\u201d said linebacker Kyle Van Noy, who played for the Chargers in 2022.",
      "John Harbaugh after the game also noted trying not to get caught up in the hype, while trying to reiterate that the game was determined by the players.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing to look back to where we are from where we came. We had different paths. We grew up in the same room and have always lived our life side by side, but that\u2019s not what the game is about,\u201d he said. \"The game really is about the players, and the players are always going to win the game or lose the game or whatever. I have so much respect for the players. Jim is the same way. We both try to treat our players with great respect, admiration and love, because that\u2019s how we feel about them.\u201d",
      "Their parents, Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, celebrated their 63rd wedding anniversary on Monday. They attended the first two games between the brothers, but are spending Thanksgiving week in Bradenton, Florida, at their daughter Joanie\u2019s house.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 10:34:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Joel Dahmen lived up to the adage that while getting a PGA Tour card is difficult, keeping it can be even harder",
    "story": [
      "Joel Dahmen lived up to the adage that while getting a PGA Tour card is difficult, keeping it can be even harder",
      "ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. -- Getting a PGA Tour card is difficult enough. Joel Dahmen can attest to that.",
      "He was a natural talent whose life got turned upside down when his mother died of cancer his junior year of high school. His brother was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and then Dahmen was diagnosed with testicular cancer some 18 months later. One setback after another.",
      "Rock bottom was spending two weeks on the couch with a dog he bought to keep him company, unable to pay his phone bill for two months until Lona \u2014 now his wife \u2014 gave him an ultimatum to practice or get a job. She also gave him $200 to get a lesson.",
      "The lesson wasn't anything he didn't already know, it was more symbolic of being dedicated. Three years later, Dahmen had his card.",
      "\u201cThis is my eighth year out here,\" he said. \u201cI probably made it longer than I ever thought.\u201d",
      "And that's what can make keeping a PGA Tour card even more stressful. Dahmen knows that feeling, too. He was living it.",
      "Dahmen was a 5-foot par putt away from missing the cut at Sea Island and making it virtually certain he would fall out of the top 125 in the FedEx Cup, losing a full PGA Tour card at a time when opportunities are about to shrink.",
      "His voice choked with emotion talking about the putt that kept alive his hopes. The pressure he felt was never more evident.",
      "\u201cIt's like you're sleeping on the lead of a major every night ... but a little more stressful than that,\" Dahmen said.",
      "So imagine the relief when Dahmen, projected outside the top 125 when he teed off in the final round of the RSM Classic, holed out a sand wedge from 113 yards for eagle, rolled in birdie putts and then held on for three nervy pars and a 64 to lock up his job.",
      "He came into the week at No. 124. He finished at No. 124. It was a lot more complicated, and far more stressful, than numbers on a points list.",
      "Dahmen long ago nearly lost his card. His first year on the PGA Tour in 2017, he had to face four weeks of Web.com Tour Finals, and his tie for sixth in the penultimate event was enough to get the 49th out of 50 cards offered that year.",
      "But it was different then because he didn't really know what he was missing. And he didn't want to lose that. That's what made Sunday so special. He shared tears with Lona and beers with his buddies on tour.",
      "\u201cYou take it for granted a little bit,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been relatively easy, cruise between 50 and 90 on the FedEx Cup every year and enjoy it, and our best friends are out here. We all have kids now and it is one of the coolest things. We get to go to like camp every week out here 25 weeks a year. We rent houses together, we stay together, our kids are playing together, they\u2019re all the same age. I didn\u2019t want to miss out on that.",
      "\u201cAs much as playing golf for a living is really cool and making a bunch of money is really cool, this has been our life,\u201d he said. \"So I thought a lot about not being able to do that as much, and that would stink.\u201d",
      "Dahmen has endeared himself to the golf world for being more everyman than journeyman, and he has become a popular figure on the Netflix \u201cFull Swing\u201d docuseries. But the struggle was real this year, never more so than the final two days.",
      "He took a double bogey on his 16th hole Saturday, wasting a solid round and leaving him outside the top 125. He described the mood that night as somber, \u201cfuneral effect.\u201d Driving to get his son Riggs, who turns 2 in January, Dahmen wondered if he'd still be getting him from tour daycare next year.",
      "But he showed something to himself, perhaps even more than when he won his only PGA Tour title in the Dominican Republic in 2021. In his two biggest rounds of the year \u2014 Friday on a cold, vicious wind to make the cut and Sunday to keep his card \u2014 he delivered.",
      "He kept preaching on Friday when he made that 5-footer that the job was not finished. He had two more days to stay in the top 125.",
      "It's a good reminder going forward. Because while his 64 on Sunday was money in so many ways, now the hard part begins. The big changes to the PGA Tour next year mean only the top 100 keep a full card, down from the top 125. The field sizes will be smaller.",
      "Getting to the PGA Tour is still hard. Staying there figures to be harder than ever.",
      "\u201cDo I get a year at 125 or do I go to 100 next year? It goes to 100 next year? Are we confirmed on that?\u201d Dahmen said. \u201cI thought I had another year of freedom.\u201d",
      "He was joking. Vintage Dahmen.",
      "But his thoughts soon turned to next season \u2014 seven weeks away \u2014 at the Sony Open.",
      "Celebrate this now. He earned it.",
      "And then try to make more putts because he'll need them to avoid missing out \u2014 on the beer with Mark Hubbard, the congratulations from J.T. Poston waiting behind the last green, on that drive to get Riggs from daycare, on a PGA Tour that feels very much like a village he doesn't want to leave.",
      "\u201cTwo of the biggest pressure moments of my career I show up, and I can take that going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cMight as well start at Sony.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The New York Sirens enter their second PWHL season featuring a new star in Sarah Fillier, a new coach in Greg Fargo and have finally landed a permanent home at New Jersey's Prudential Center",
      "Soon after the final refrains of Frank Sinatra\u2019s iconic \u201cNew York, New York\u201d finished playing over the loudspeakers to signify New York's preseason 5-2 victory over Toronto, Sarah Fillier took a seat at the podium to go over her three-goal outing.",
      "Perhaps this was a glimpse of what\u2019s to come from the rookie No. 1 draft pick for her nomadic, win-starved Sirens team that opens its second PWHL season at the defending champion Minnesota Frost on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy with how the game went,\u201d Fillier said last week, following a game in which the 24-year-old capped a hockey cycle of sorts by scoring a shorthanded, power-play and even-strength goal. \u201cEvery game I\u2019m trying to be dangerous in the offensive zone, so it\u2019s nice for our line to get a few.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s the expectation going forward for a player dubbed a generational talent and a three-time Patty Kazmaier college player of the year finalist at Princeton. She scored eight goals in her Olympic debut as part of Canada\u2019s gold medal-winning team in 2022, and is a three-time world champion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun to be on the same line than against her,\u201d U.S. national team veteran and Sirens star Alex Carpenter said of her new linemate. \u201cI think from the first day we had camp, we were firing on all cylinders. And I think that\u2019s something that we wanted last year.\u201d",
      "Those little town blues and vagabond shoes \u2014 New York split its home games at three venues across three states \u2014 might be a lament of the past for the Sirens following a nearly forgettable first season. After a 4-0 win over Toronto in the PWHL's inaugural game, New York won only four more in regulation, allowed a league-worst 67 goals and scored a league-low 31 even-strength goals in 24 outings.",
      "Fillier is up for the challenge and stepping into the spotlight of a crowded Big Apple sports landscape.",
      "\u201cThey might have finished last, but I thought I kind of won the lottery,\u201d Fillier said. \u201cI think they have a really great foundation. And I think there\u2019s a lot of motivation from where they finished last. And I\u2019m excited to slide right into that.\u201d",
      "Fillier represents but one piece of what stands as a fresh start in New York. The team has a new coach, with Colgate\u2019s Greg Fargo replacing Howie Draper. And aside from having a nickname as all PWHL teams now do, the Sirens finally have a permanent home at the NHL Devils\u2019 Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, after also playing in Bridgeport, Connecticut and at the NHL Islanders\u2019 UBS Arena.",
      "The Sirens draft class also brought in Swedish blue-liner Maja Nylen Persson and Finnish forward Noora Tulus, who made the jump from Sweden\u2019s pro women\u2019s league, and are fixtures on their respective national teams.",
      "\u201cLots of changes and I think for the better,\u201d defenseman Ella Shelton said. \u201cAnd now all those things that were at the forefront of our brains last year maybe take a backseat, and we can just kind of focus on hockey at this point and come together as a team.\u201d",
      "Shelton led PWHL defensemen with seven goals and ranked fifth overall with 21 points. Carpenter led the league with 15 assists, and finished tied for second with 23 points. The drop-off in production was dramatic, with Jessie Eldridge (seven goals, seven assists) New York's only other player to crack the top 20 in points.",
      "In goal, Corinne Schroeder finished second in the league with .930 save-percentage, but eighth with 2.40 goals-against average in facing a league-high 34 shots per outing.",

      "Hill was eventually stood up, but then an officer dragged him into a sitting position on the curb after he said a knee injury made that difficult.",

      "Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",

      "In allegations that UMG calls \u201coffensive and untrue,\u201d the filing says the record company \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 in order to make that song go viral, including by using \u2018bots\u2019 and pay-to-play agreements.\u201d It said the company and Spotify \u201chave a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship\u201d and alleges that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.",
      "The petition also says UMG has fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \"in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\"",
      "Universal Music Group said in a statement in response that the \"suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May as part of a flurry of dueling tracks by the two artists, includes the lyrics, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young, You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d It has gotten more than 900 million plays, according to figures listed on Spotify.",
      "Spotify representatives declined immediate comment, but in a statement on a previous case, the company said it \u201cinvests heavily in automated and manual reviews to prevent, detect, and mitigate the impact of artificial streaming on our platform,\u201d and in broader public statements has said it has gone to great lengths to mitigate the effects of bad actors on streaming numbers and royalties.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre's biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year. The move to court, while not yet a lawsuit, still represents a major escalation of the feud and involves some of the biggest business partners of both men."

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:42:35 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
      "ATLANTA -- President Joe Biden's administration announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy will make a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian Automotive to build a factory in Georgia that had stalled as the startup electric vehicle maker struggled to become profitable.",
      "It's unclear whether the administration can complete the loan before Donald Trump becomes president again in less than two months, or whether the Trump administration might try to claw the money back.",
      "Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles and $4,000 for used ones.",
      "Rivian made a splash when it went public and began producing large electric R1 SUVs, pickup trucks and delivery vans at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, in 2021. Months later, the California-based company announced it would build a second, larger, $5 billion plant about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Atlanta, near the town of Social Circle.",
      "The R1 vehicles cost $70,000 or more. The company plans to produce R2 vehicles, a smaller SUV, in Georgia with lower price tags aimed at a mass market. The first phase of Rivian\u2019s Georgia factory is projected to make 200,000 vehicles a year, with a second phase capable of another 200,000 a year. Eventually, the plant is projected to employ 7,500 workers.",
      "But Rivian was unable to meet production and sales targets and rapidly burned through cash. In March, the company said it would pause construction of the Georgia plant. The company said it would begin assembling its R2 SUV in Illinois instead.",
      "CEO RJ Scaringe said the move would allow Rivian to start selling the R2 sooner and save $2.25 billion in capital spending. Since then, German automaker Volkswagen AG said in June it would invest $5 billion in Rivian in a joint venture in which Rivian would share software and electrical technology with Volkswagen. The money eased Rivian's cash crunch.",
      "Tuesday's announcement throws a lifeline to Rivian's grander plans. The company said its plans to make the R2 and the smaller R3 in Georgia are back on and that production will begin in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,\u201d Scaringe said in a statement.",
      "The Energy Department said the loan would substantially boost electric vehicles made in the United States and support Biden\u2019s goal of having zero-emission vehicles make up half of all new U.S. sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cAs one of a few American EV startups with light duty vehicles already on the road, Rivian\u2019s Georgia facility will allow the company to reach production volumes that make its products more cost competitive and accelerate access to international markets,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "The loan includes $6 billion, plus $600 million in interest that will be rolled into the principal. The money would come from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to make fuel-efficient vehicles and components. The program has focused mostly on loans to new battery factories for electric vehicles under Biden, but earlier helped finance initial production of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, two pioneering electric vehicles.",
      "The loan program, created in 2007, requires a \"reasonable prospect of repayment\" of the loan. Under Biden, the program has announced deals totaling $33.3 billion, including $9.2 billion for massive battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky for Ford\u2019s electric vehicles.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who has been a vocal supporter of electric vehicle and solar manufacturing in Georgia, hailed Tuesday's announcement as \u201cyet another historic federal investment in Georgia electric vehicle manufacturing.\u201d Ossoff had asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to support the loan in July.",
      "\u201cOur federal manufacturing incentives are driving economic development across the state of Georgia,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp says his goal is to make Georgia a center of the electric vehicle industry. But the Republican has had a strained relationship with the Biden administration over its industrial policy, even as some studies have found Georgia has netted more electric vehicle investment than any other state.",
      "Kemp has long claimed that manufacturers were picking Georgia before Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, was passed.",
      "Efforts to bring Rivian to Georgia predated the Biden administration and \"our shared vision to bring opportunity to Georgia will remain no matter who resides in the White House or what party controls Congress,\u201d Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said Tuesday.",
      "The loan to Rivian could rescue one of the Kemp administration's signature economic development projects even as Biden leaves office. That could put Rivian and Kemp in the position of defending the loan if Trump tries to quash it.",
      "State and local governments offered Rivian an incentive package worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 2022. Neighbors opposed to development of the Georgia site mounted legal challenges.",
      "State and local governments spent around $125 million to buy and prepare the nearly 2,000-acre (810-hectare) site. The state also has completed most of $50 million in roadwork that it pledged.",
      "The pause at Rivian contrasts with rapid construction at Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex near Savannah. The Korean automaker said in October that it had begun production in Ellabell, where it plans to eventually employ 8,500.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Interpol arrested 1,006 suspects in Africa during a massive two-month operation, clamping down on cybercrime that left tens of thousands of victims, including some who were trafficked, and produced millions in financial damages, the global police organization said Tuesday.",
      "Operation Serengeti, a joint operation with Afripol, the African Union's police agency, ran from Sept. 2 to Oct. 31 in 19 African countries and targeted criminals behind ransomware, business email compromise, digital extortion and online scams, the agency said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom multi-level marketing scams to credit card fraud on an industrial scale, the increasing volume and sophistication of cybercrime attacks is of serious concern,\" said Valdecy Urquiza, the Secretary General of Interpol.",
      "Interpol pinpointed 35,000 victims, with cases linked to nearly $193 million in financial losses worldwide, stating that local police authorities and private sector partners, including internet service providers, played a key role in the operation.",
      "Jalel Chelba, Afripol\u2019s Executive Director, said in the statement: \u201cThrough Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States,\u201d",
      "Serengeti\u2019s results were a \u201cdrastic increase\u201d compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol\u2019s Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press.",
      "Interpol\u2019s previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years.",
      "\u201cSignificant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,\u201d Gonzalez said.",
      "In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme.",
      "Chelba said Afripol\u2019s focus now includes emerging threats like Artificial Intelligence-driven malware and advanced cyberattack techniques.",
      "Other dismantled networks included a group in Cameroon suspected of using a multi-level marketing scam for human trafficking, an international criminal group in Angola running an illegal virtual casino and a cryptocurrency investment scam in Nigeria, the agency said.",
      "Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest \u2014 if not best-funded \u2014 police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries.",
      "Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union\u2019s police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States."

      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technolog...",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technology that the Biden administration already uses to help make crucial decisions in tracking, detaining and ultimately deporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status.",
      "While immigration officials have used the tech for years, an October letter from the Department of Homeland Security obtained exclusively by The Associated Press details how those tools \u2014 some of them powered by AI \u2014 help make decisions over whether an immigrant should be detained or surveilled.",
      "One algorithm, for example, ranks immigrants with a \u201cHurricane Score,\u201d ranging from 1-5, to assess whether someone will \u201cabscond\u201d from the agency's supervision.",
      "The letter, sent by DHS Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen to the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law, revealed that the score calculates the potential risk that an immigrant \u2014 with a pending case \u2014 will fail to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The algorithm relies on several factors, he said, including an immigrant\u2019s number of violations and length of time in the program, and whether the person has a travel document. Hysen wrote that ICE officers consider the score, among other information, when making decisions about an immigrant\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cThe Hurricane Score does not make decisions on detention, deportation, or surveillance; instead, it is used to inform human decision-making,\u201d Hysen wrote.",
      "Also included in the government\u2019s tool kit is a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial matching and can track an immigrant\u2019s specific location.",
      "Nearly 200,000 people without legal status who are in removal proceedings are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention program, under which certain immigrants can live in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "In exchange, SmartLINK and GPS trackers used by ICE rigorously surveil them and their movements. The phone application draws on facial matching technology and geolocation data, which has been used before to find and arrest those using the app.",
      "Just Futures Law wrote to Hysen earlier this year, questioning the fairness of using an algorithm to assess whether someone is a flight risk and raising concerns over how much data SmartLINK collects. Such AI systems, which score or screen people, are used widely but remain largely unregulated even though some have been found to discriminate on race, gender or other protected traits.",
      "DHS said in an email that it is committed to ensuring that its use of AI is transparent and safeguards privacy and civil rights while avoiding biases. The agency said it is working to implement the Biden administration\u2019s requirements on using AI, but Hysen said in his letter that security officials may waive those requirements for certain uses. Trump has publicly vowed to repeal Biden's AI policy when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cDHS uses AI to assist our personnel in their work, but DHS does not use the outputs of AI systems as the sole basis for any law enforcement action or denial of benefits,\u201d a spokesperson for DHS told the AP.",
      "Trump has not revealed how he plans to carry out his promised deportation of an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Although he has proposed invoking wartime powers, as well as military involvement, the plan would face major logistical challenges \u2014 such as where to keep those who have been detained and how to find people spread across the country \u2014 that AI-powered surveillance tools could potentially address.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer questions about how the incoming administration plans to use DHS\u2019 tech, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation\u201d in American history.",
      "Over 100 civil society groups sent a letter on Friday urging the Office of Management and Budget to require DHS to comply with the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines. A spokesperson for OMB said that agencies must align their AI tools with the guidelines by December 1, and that any extensions or waivers of that deadline will be publicly disclosed next month.",
      "Just Futures Law\u2019s executive director, Paromita Shah, said if immigrants are scored as flight risks, they are more likely to remain in detention, \"limiting their ability to prepare a defense in their case in immigration court, which is already difficult enough as it is.\u201d",
      "SmartLINK, part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison company The GEO Group. The GEO Group also contracts with ICE to run detention centers.",
      "ICE is tight-lipped about how it uses SmartLINK\u2019s location feature to find and arrest immigrants. Still, public records show that during Trump\u2019s first term in 2018, Manassas, Virginia-based employees of BI Inc. relayed immigrants\u2019 GPS locations to federal authorities, who then arrested over 40 people.",
      "In a report last year to address privacy issues and concerns, DHS said that the mobile app includes security features that \u201cprohibit access to information on the participant\u2019s mobile device, with the exception of location data points when the app is open.\u201d",
      "But the report notes that there remains a risk that data collected from people \"may be misused for unauthorized persistent monitoring.\u201d",
      "Such information could also be stored in other ICE and DHS databases and used for other DHS mission purposes, the report said.",
      "On investor calls earlier this month, private prison companies were clear-eyed about the opportunities ahead.",
      "The GEO Group\u2019s executive chairman George Christopher Zoley said that he expects the incoming Trump administration to \u201ctake a much more aggressive approach regarding border security as well as interior enforcement and to request additional funding from Congress to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn GEO\u2019s ISAP program, we can scale up from the present 182,500 participants to several hundreds of thousands, or even millions of participants,\u201d Zoley said.",
      "That same day, the head of another private prison company told investors he would be watching closely to see how the new administration may change immigrant monitoring programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for multiple vendors to engage ICE about the program going forward and think about creative and innovative solutions to not only get better outcomes, but also scale up the program as necessary,\u201d Damon Hininger, CEO of the private prison company CoreCivic Inc. said on an earnings call.",
      "GEO did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, CoreCivic said that it has played \u201ca valued but limited role in America\u2019s immigration system\u201d for both Democrats and Republicans for over 40 years."

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market. A technology called DoubleClick is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while Google Ads maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined it constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation.",
      "In Monday's arguments, Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum cited the search engine case when he highlighted an email from a Google executive, David Rosenblatt, who said in a 2009 email that Google\u2019s goal was to \u201cdo to display what Google did to search,\" which Teitelbaum said showed the company's intent to achieve market dominance.",

      "The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties.",
      "It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users\u2019 privacy.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which \u201csupports parents to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d to children wanting to use social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media in its current form is not a safe product for them,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cAccess to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,\u201d she added.",

      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",
      "She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to \u201cdarker, less safe online spaces\u201d than mainstream platforms.",
      "Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that \u201cthis could compromise the safety of young people,\u201d prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous statement. You\u2019re trying to protect the big tech giants,\u201d Henderson said.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",

      "\u201cWe need to see continued investment in algorithms and ensuring that they do a better job at addressing harmful content,\u201d Bose said.",
      "Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn\u2019t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children.",
      "She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022.",
      "Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Biden administration plans on reducing part of Intel's $8.5 billion in federal funding for computer chip plants around the country, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The reduction is largely a byproduct of the $3 billion that Intel is also receiving to provide computer chips to the military. President Joe Biden announced the agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans in March.",
      "The changes to Intel\u2019s funding are not related to the company\u2019s financial record or milestones, the people familiar with the grant told The Associated Press. In August, the chipmaker announced that it would cut 15% of its workforce \u2014 about 15,000 jobs \u2014 in an attempt to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD.",
      "Unlike some of its rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them.",
      "Two years ago, President Biden hailed Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised the company for plans to \u201cbuild a workforce of the future\u201d for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year.",
      "The California-based tech giant's funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Biden has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation.",
      "The Biden administration helped shepherd the legislation following pandemic-era concerns that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession. When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.",
      "In August, the administration pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant could expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time. The Commerce Department said the funding for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. meant the company could expand on its existing plans for two facilities in Phoenix and add a third, newly announced production hub.",
      "The administration has promised tens of billions of dollars to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",

      "\u201cI have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,\u201d the post said.",
      "Dotcom\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer, Ira Rothken, confirmed to The Associated Press that the contents of the statement were accurate. Rothken would not say whether Dotcom or someone else wrote the post and did not provide further details.",
      "Usually a prolific X user, the 50-year-old internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6. His New Zealand-based lawyer, Ron Mansfield, told the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday that Dotcom suffered the stroke on Nov. 7 and is expected to remain hospitalized for some time. His prognosis is uncertain, Mansfield said.",
      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer."

      "A Michigan State University engineering professor and undergraduate student have designed and produced a 3D-printed helmet earhole insert that helps to drown out crowd noise for some players on the school's football team",
      "EAST LANSING, Mich. -- The sight was a common one for Andrew Kolpacki. For many a Sunday, he would watch NFL games on TV and see quarterbacks putting their hands on their helmets, desperately trying to hear the play call from the sideline or booth as tens of thousands of fans screamed at the tops of their lungs.",
      "When the NCAA\u2019s playing rules oversight committee this past spring approved the use of coach-to-player helmet communications in games for the 2024 season, Kolpacki, Michigan State\u2019s head football equipment manager, knew the Spartans\u2019 QBs and linebackers were going to have a problem.",
      "\u201cThere had to be some sort of solution,\u201d he said.",
      "As it turns out, there was. And it was right across the street.",
      "Kolpacki reached out to Tamara Reid Bush, a mechanical engineering professor who not only heads the school\u2019s Biomechanical Design Research Laboratory but also is a football season ticket-holder.",
      "Kolpacki \u201cshowed me some photos and said that other teams had just put duct tape inside the (earhole), and he asked me, \u2018Do you think we can do anything better than duct tape,?\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh, absolutely.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bush and Rylie DuBois, a sophomore biosystems engineering major and undergraduate research assistant at the lab, set out to produce earhole inserts made from polylactic acid, a bio-based plastic, using a 3D printer. Part of the challenge was accounting for the earhole sizes and shapes that vary depending on helmet style.",
      "Once the season got underway with a Friday night home game against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30, the helmets of starting quarterback Aidan Chiles and linebacker Jordan Turner were outfitted with the inserts, which helped mitigate crowd noise.",
      "DuBois attended the game, sitting in the student section.",
      "\u201cI felt such a strong sense of accomplishment and pride,\u201d DuBois said. \u201cAnd I told all my friends around me about how I designed what they were wearing on the field.\u201d",
      "All told, Bush and DuBois have produced around 180 sets of the inserts, a number that grew in part due to the variety of helmet designs and colors that are available to be worn by Spartan players any given Saturday. Plus, the engineering folks have been fine-tuning their design throughout the season.",
      "Dozens of Bowl Subdivision programs are doing something similar. In many cases, they\u2019re getting 3D-printed earhole covers from XO Armor Technologies, which provides on-site, on-demand 3D printing of athletic wearables.",
      "The Auburn, Alabama-based company has donated its version of the earhole covers to the equipment managers of programs ranging from Georgia and Clemson to Boise State and Arizona State in the hope the schools would consider doing business with XO Armor in the future, said Jeff Klosterman, vice president of business development.",
      "XO Armor first was approached by the Houston Texans at the end of last season about creating something to assist quarterback C.J. Stroud in better hearing play calls delivered to his helmet during road games. XO Armor worked on a solution and had completed one when it received another inquiry: Ohio State, which had heard Michigan State was moving forward with helmet inserts, wondered if XO Armor had anything in the works.",
      "\u201cWe kind of just did this as a one-off favor to the Texans and honestly didn\u2019t forecast it becoming our viral moment in college football,\u201d Klosterman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got about 60 teams across college football and the NFL wearing our sound-deadening earhole covers every weekend.\u201d",
      "The rules state that only one player for each team is permitted to be in communication with coaches while on the field. For the Spartans, it\u2019s typically Chiles on offense and Turner on defense. Turner prefers to have an insert in both earholes, but Chiles has asked that the insert be used in only one on his helmet.",
      "Chiles \u201clikes to be able to feel like he has some sort of outward exposure,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "Exposure is something the sophomore signal-caller from Long Beach, California, had in away games against Michigan and Oregon this season. Michigan Stadium welcomed 110,000-plus fans for the Oct. 26 matchup between the in-state rivals. And while just under 60,000 packed Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, for the Ducks' 31-10 win over Michigan State three weeks earlier, it was plenty loud. \u201cThe Big Ten has some pretty impressive venues,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "\u201cIt can be just deafening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what those fans are there for is to create havoc and make it difficult for coaches to get a play call off.\u201d",
      "Something that is a bit easier to handle thanks to Bush and her team. She called the inserts a \u201cwin-win-win\" for everyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to work with athletics and the football team,\" she said. \"I think it\u2019s really exciting for our students as well to take what they\u2019ve learned and develop and design something and see it being used and executed.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
      "A bankruptcy judge on Monday delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars, keeping the auction sale up in the air for at least another few weeks.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction that resulted in The Onion being named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with him. A trustee overseeing the auction denies the allegations and accuses Jones of launching a smear campaign because he didn't like the outcome.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez had been scheduled to hear an emergency motion to disqualify The Onion's bid on Monday, but put it off until either Dec. 9 or Dec. 17. That's also when the judge will hear arguments on the trustee's request to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion. Lopez said it made sense to have one hearing on both requests.",
      "\u201cI want a fair and transparent process and let\u2019s just see where the process goes,\" Lopez said.",
      "Lopez could ultimately allow The Onion to move forward with its purchase, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Jones continues to broadcast his show from the Infowars studio, but he has set up a new location, websites and social media accounts as a precaution. The trustee shut down the Austin studio and Infowars' websites for about 24 hours last week after The Onion was announced as the winning bidder, but allowed them to resume the next day, drawing more complaints from Jones.",
      "Jones declared bankruptcy and liquidated his assets after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. He was ordered to pay damages for defamation and emotional distress in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas after he repeatedly said the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones\u2019 creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Last year, Lopez ruled that $1.1 billion of the Sandy Hook judgments could not be discharged in the bankruptcy. On Monday, he denied a request from Sandy Hook families to make the full $1.5 billion not dischargeable, meaning the debt cannot be wiped clean.",
      "Also Monday, lawyers for the social media platform X objected to any sale of the accounts of both Jones and Infowars, saying X is the owner of the accounts and it has not given consent for them to be sold or transferred. Jones' personal X account, with 3.3 million followers, was not part of the auction, but Lopez will be deciding if it should be included in the liquidation.",
      "Jones has praised X owner Elon Musk on his show and suggested that Musk should buy Infowars. Musk has not responded publicly to that suggestion and was not among the bidders.",
      "Jones was permanently banned from Twitter in 2018 for abusive behavior, but Musk restored Jones\u2019 account on the platform he has since renamed X in December last year.",
      "Jones alleges The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of the Sandy Hook families, the humor site and the court-appointed trustee.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected from among the two sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account. He filed a counter lawsuit last week against Murray, The Onion's parent company and the Sandy Hook families in the bankruptcy court.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, Murray called the allegations a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to delay the sale of Infowars to The Onion and accused Jones, his lawyers and attorneys for First United American Companies of a \u201cvicious smear campaign lobbing patently false accusations.\u201d He also alleged Jones collaborated with First United American Companies to try to buy Infowars.",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts. Another auction of remaining assets is set for Dec. 10.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate, guns and other belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court this year say Jones had about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Amazon has introduced a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce giant says will improve efficiency and reduce employee injuries",
      "Amazon has introduced a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce giant says will improve efficiency and reduce employee injuries.",
      "Two robotic arms named Robin and Cardinal can lift packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. A third, called Sparrow, picks up items from bins and puts them in other containers.",
      "Proteus, an autonomous mobile robot that operates on the floor, can move carts around a warehouse. The bipedal, humanoid robot Digit is being tested to help move empty totes with its hands. And there\u2019s also Sequoia, a containerized storage system that can present totes to employees in a way that allows them to avoid stretching or squatting to grab inventory.",
      "Amazon says Robin is currently being used in dozens of warehouses. The others are in a testing stage or haven\u2019t been rolled out widely. But the company says it's already seeing benefits, such as reducing the time it takes to fulfill orders and helping employees avoid repetitive tasks. However, automation also carries drawbacks for workers, who would have to be retrained for new positions if the robots made their roles obsolete.",
      "In October, Amazon held an event at a Nashville, Tennessee, warehouse where the company had integrated some of the robots. The Associated Press spoke with Julie Mitchell, the director of Amazon\u2019s robotic sortation technologies, about where the company hopes to go from here. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: This journey that we\u2019ve been on has taken a couple of years. Luckily for us, we\u2019ve been at this for over a decade. So we have a lot of core technology that we can build on top of. We started these particular robots - Cardinal and Proteus - in this building in November 2022. We came in and began playing around with what it would look like to pack and move a production order. Less than two years later, we are at scale and shipping 70% of the items in this building through that robotics system.",
      "A: We talk about \u201cbuild, test and scale\u201d and that\u2019s about a two-year cycle for us right now.",
      "A: As you can probably imagine, we have so many items, so it\u2019s an exceptional challenge. We rely on data and putting our first prototype in a real building, where we expose it to all the things we need it to do. Then we drive down all the reasons that it fails. We give it a lot of sample sizes in a very short period of time. For example, a couple of years ago, we launched our Robin robotics arm \u2013 a package manipulation robot \u2013 and we\u2019re at 3 billion picks. So the ability to launch into our network, rapidly collect data, scale and iterate has enabled us to go fast.",
      "The challenge itself can be boiled down to three simple things: you need to perceive the scene, plan your motion and then execute. Today, those are three different parts of our system. Artificial intelligence is going to help us change all of that, and it\u2019s going to be more outcome-driven, like asking it to pick up a bottle of water. We\u2019re on the verge, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m personally excited to be here at the onset of generative AI and use it to dramatically improve the performance of our robotics.",
      "A: With the technology we\u2019ve deployed here, we\u2019re creating new roles for individuals that can acquire new skills to fulfill those roles. And these new skills are not something that is too difficult to achieve. You don\u2019t need an engineering degree, Ph.D. or any really technical skills to support our robotics systems. We designed the systems so they\u2019re easy to service and train on the job to be a reliability maintenance engineer.",
      "We are working backwards from the idea that we want to employ more skilled labor. These opportunities are obviously higher paid than the entry level jobs in our buildings. And partnering with MIT has helped us understand what matters most to our team as we\u2019re deploying these technologies across our network.",
      "A: Not in the adoption. We\u2019re integrating it. But these are complex systems and this is the real world, so things go wrong. For example, we had bad weather due to the storms in the Southeast. When I look at the robotics systems data, I can tell the weather is bad outside because that dramatically affects how the ship dock works.",
      "When trucks don\u2019t arrive on time or when they can\u2019t leave, you see bottlenecks in the building in strange ways. Containers build up, we have to put them in different places, and then humans need to recover them. So communication between what our robotics system is doing and what we need employees in the building to do to recover is important. It's a collaboration of automation and humans to deal with real-world problems. It\u2019s not a matter of having robotics take over but making it one system of humans and robotics working together to accomplish the goal of shipping the product."

      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture. But, more than a year later, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make \u201cGlicked\u201d \u2014 or even \u201cBabyratu\u201d \u2014 happen.",
      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:23:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is recommending the country's security cabinet agree to a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah brokered by the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The vote to approve the deal was 10-1.",
      "Israel's cabinet has approved the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah after prolonged negotiations.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the cabinet for approval Tuesday evening local time. The deal was approved 10-1, with only far-right minister Ben Gvir voting against the plan.",
      "Israel announced the deal, followed shortly after by an announcement at the White House by President Joe Biden. The deal will go into effect at 4 a.m. local time, Biden said.",
      "The Lebanese army and security forces will deploy in southern Lebanon over the next 60 days and take control of the territory controlled by Hezbollah, Biden said. At the same time, Israel will withdraw its forces over the next 60 days in order for civilians to return to their homes on both sides of the border. The bombing continued in Beirut Tuesday evening, even as Biden wrapped up his comments, with the deal not going into effect until morning.",
      "\"Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security,\" the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.",
      "Netanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.",
      "\"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"We will enforce the agreement and respond forcefully to any violation. We will continue together until victory.\"",
      "Biden echoed those thoughts in his comments, saying, \"Let me be clear, if Hezbollah, or anyone else, breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense, consistent with international law, just like any country when facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.\"",
      "The prime minister hailed \"great achievements\" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.",
      "\"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action,\" Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. \"If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. If it tries to renew terrorist infrastructure near the border -- we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack.\"",
      "The deal does not affect the ongoing war in Gaza being fought by Israel against Hamas. However, Biden said the U.S. will continue to work to find a peace in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza,\" Biden said. \"They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement. People of Gaza have been through hell, their worlds absolutely shattered.\"",
      "He continued, \"Far too many civilians in Gaza have suffered far too much, and Hamas has refused for months and months to negotiate a good-faith ceasefire, and a hostage deal. And so now, Hamas has a choice to make their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens, which they hold.\"",
      "Netanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.",
      "This was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.",
      "Netanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.",
      "In October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "Tensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court has dropped Donald Trump from the special counsel's appeal of his classified documents case, ending Trump's prosecution on federal charges.",
    "story": [
      "The special counsel is still pursuing the case against Trump's co-defendants.",
      "One day after special counsel Jack Smith moved to dismiss both his cases against President-elect Donald Trump, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit complied by dropping Trump from Smith's appeal of his classified documents case, ending Trump's prosecution on federal charges.",
      "\"Appellant's motion to dismiss the appeal as to Donald J. Trump only is GRANTED,\" the Eleventh Circuit's clerk wrote in a one-sentence order Tuesday.",
      "Smith is continuing to appeal U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's dismissal of the case with Trump's two co-defendants, his longtime valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira.",
      "In a filing on Tuesday, Smith urged the appeals court to reverse Cannon's decision to toss the classified documents case based on the constitutionality of Smith's appointment as special counsel.",
      "Smith moved to drop Trump from the case Monday due to a long-standing Justice Department policy that bars the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information ranging from U.S. nuclear secrets to the nation's defense capabilities, and took steps to thwart the government's efforts to get the documents back.",
      "Trump, along with Nauta and De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty to allegedly attempting to delete related surveillance footage at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Judge Cannon dismissed the case against all three defendants this past July on the grounds that Smith's appointment as special counsel overseeing the case was unconstitutional because he was not appointed by the president or confirmed by Congress.",
      "Smith, in Tuesday's filing, urged the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to reverse Cannon's \"flawed\" conclusion so he can continue the case against Nauta and De Oliveira.",
      "\"The Supreme Court held more than 50 years ago that Congress vested the Attorney General with the power to appoint special prosecutors like the Special Counsel, and the text, context, and history of the four statutes the Supreme Court identified, as well as the long history of special-counsel appointments, confirm that Nixon was correct,\" the filing said.",
      "In a statement Monday, John Irving, a lawyer for De Oliveira, said, \"The Special Counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "Tuesday's filing was Smith's last against Trump as a defendant.",
      "\"The government has moved to dismiss this appeal as to Donald Trump. If granted, defendant Trump will not appear in the caption in future filings in this case,\" Smith wrote in a footnote of the filing.",

    "summary": "The running mates did not address the scrutiny surrounding their campaign finances but celebrated the historic sums of money they were able to raise during the cycle.",
    "story": [
      "It was Harris' first public remarks since conceding on Nov. 6.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday thanked supporters during a virtual call and vowed that the \"fight's not over\" in her first remarks since conceding defeat to President-elect Donald Trump three weeks ago.",
      "\"The fight that fueled our campaign, a fight for freedom and opportunity, that did not end on Nov. 5. A fight for the dignity of all people? That did not end on Nov. 5,\" Harris said. \"A fight for the future, a future in which all people receive the promise of America? No. A fight that is about a fight for the ideals of our nation, the ideals that reflect the promise of America? That fight's not over.\"",
      "\"That fight's still in us, and it burns strong,\" Harris later added. \"And I know this is an uncertain time. I'm clear-eyed about that. I know you're clear-eyed about it, and it feels heavy. And I just have to remind you: Don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before Nov. 5 and you have the same purpose that you did and you have the same ability to engage and inspire. So don't ever let anybody or any circumstance take your power from you.\"",
      "The grassroots call came immediately after Harris held a call with her campaign's finance committee. The finance call was attended by more than 400 donors, according to a source familiar.",
      "On the grassroots call, Harris also briefly discussed the historic sum of money that ran her campaign, though she did not address what went wrong as she and her campaign face intense scrutiny over how they could raise that money and lose to Trump so resolutely.",
      "\u200b\u200b\"The outcome of this election, obviously, is not what we wanted. It is not what we work so hard for,\" Harris said. \"But I am proud of the race we ran. And your role in this was critical. What we did in 107 days was unprecedented.\"",
      "Harris said that over the course of those 100-plus days, her campaign raised $1.4 billion, much of which was from grassroot donors: \"Nearly 8 million donors contributed an average donation of about $56.\"",
      "\"You gave all that you could to support our campaign. Because of your efforts -- get this -- we raised an historic $1.4 billion, almost $1.5 billion from grassroots supporters alone, the most in presidential campaign history,\" she said.",
      "\"Being involved can make a difference, and that remains true. And that's one of the pieces that I just want us to please take away -- that our fight for freedom and for opportunity and for the promise of America, it included, for example, nearly almost 4 million first-time contributors to our campaign because of the work you did, of helping people know that they can be engaged and that they're not outside, that they're inside, that we're all in this together,\" she added.",
      "Harris was joined by her former running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on both calls -- a rare appearance from the two, though Harris joined the call from San Francisco and Walz from Minnesota.",
      "Walz on the grassroot donor call also spoke to supporters' feeling of loss following the election and repeated Harris' claims that she is not finished with fighting.",
      "\"I think all of us saw the possibility, and I know there's a bit of a feeling of loss because we saw what a real leader looks like,\" Walz said.",
      "\"She did deliver the best of our better angels,\" he added. \"She delivered a vision where all of us mattered. She did it with grace and dignity and continues to do that every single day. She is still in this fight. She is doing it every single day. She is not done with her current job. She's not done being part of it with all of you.\"",
      "Harris' and Walz's remarks follow some postelection analysis from Harris campaign senior officials during an episode of \"Pod Save America\" that aired on Tuesday, including some reaction to finances.",
      "Harris campaign Chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said that during the cycle, the bulk of the campaign's spending was used to reach out to \"very-hard-to-find voters,\" including low-propensity and young voters, while investing across all swing states because polling reflected that each was in play.",
      "\"We were trying to, yes, spend more resources on digital ... because we're trying to find young people, we're trying to find these lower-propensity voters that were tuned out to politics,\" O'Malley Dillon said.",
      "\"We had some unique things that we had to do in this race that I think were really critical to do early and spent a lot of resources at an earlier stage than we would have to,\" she added, noting those resources were spent on both advertising and field programming. \"We saw, up until the very end, that ... every single state was in such a margin of error. There was nothing that told us we couldn't play in one of these states.\"",
      "During the podcast, O'Malley Dillon and senior campaign adviser David Plouffe accused the Trump campaign of coordinating with its super PACs, a practice that is not legal, but noted the Democrats need to take note and do the same.",
      "\"We have to stop playing a different game as it relates to super PACs and the Republicans. Love our Democratic lawyers. I'm tired of it, OK? They coordinate more than we do. I think amongst themselves, I think with the presidential campaign, like I'm just sick and tired, OK? So, we cannot be at a disadvantage,\" Plouffe said.",
      "\"I think our side was completely mismatched when it came to the ecosystem of Trump and his super PACs and ours,\" O'Malley Dillon said.",
      "\"We had a super PAC that was helpful, very important and necessary for the work that they did because they were the kind of central recipients of a lot of the funding on our side and they staked a strategy and a plan, and we clearly could see it, and we knew what it was [going] to spend, but we did not have the ability to have people come in with us early. And so every ounce of advertising, every ounce of carrying these strategic imperatives, of defining the vice president and trying to bring down Trump's numbers, all sat with us as a campaign,\" O'Malley Dillon added.",
      "Harris has rarely been seen since she delivered her concession speech at Howard University the day after the election. She attended the Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery a week later and was seen making her first return to the White House a day after that. The vice president also spent the last week on vacation in Hawaii.",
      "Walz, in the month since the election, has remained almost entirely out of the national spotlight, resuming his duties as the governor of Minnesota.",
      "He delivered his final speech of the 2024 campaign cycle on Nov. 8 from suburban Minneapolis, joining a chorus of fellow Democratic governors who said they would protect their states from threats to reproductive freedoms, citizenship and other things under the Trump administration. The former vice presidential nominee also said he'd work to find common ground with swaths of people who voted \"for the other side\" on Nov. 5.",
      "Harris and Walz remained mostly separate on the campaign trail in the roughly 15 weeks she had him as her running mate. The governor was present at Harris' concession speech at Howard University the night after the election but did not speak or publicly interact with her. Before that, the two held a joint rally on Oct. 28 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, their first event together since late August, when they were seen together in Savannah, Georgia, on a bus tour.",
      "Prior to that, their last time at a rally together was in Milwaukee for programming linked to the Democratic National Convention in August.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:59:47 -0500",
    "summary": "While President-elect Donald Trump is promising sweeping conservative policies, experts say the powers that states hold could make it harder for him to implement them.",
    "story": [
      "Local leaders have control over some of the things Trump wants to change.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have vowed to radically shift American policy from Day 1.",
      "From mass deportations to eliminating the Department of Education, Trump's policies could impact millions of people and communities across the country. However, experts say there is a big obstacle that will make it harder -- if not impossible -- for the incoming administration to implement these plans: States and municipalities.",
      "Alison LaCroix, professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, told ABC News that the power to regulate and implement key laws lies strictly within the states and many local leaders have already been working to prepare for a possible future Trump administration.",
      "\"The states have a lot of levers in the constitutional system, legal system and other systems,\" she said. \"This usually comes as a lot of shock to people who don't know how much power they wield but we're going to soon find out how valuable they are.\"",
      "Other experts who have focused on some of the biggest sectors targeted by Trump, such as public health and immigration, agreed but said they are likely gearing up for a legal and policy fight that could last a long time.",
      "For example, Trump and his allies have been very open about their proposals to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "Trump has said he aims to remove at least 1 million immigrants living in the country illegally from the U.S. as soon as possible.",
      "Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School's immigration clinic, told ABC News that states can't outright act as immigration enforcement for the federal government without an agreement.",
      "\"It is the principle that the federal government cannot order local law enforcement to enact federal priorities,\" she said.",
      "Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom of California and JB Pritzker of Illinois have vowed not to assist Trump with any mass deportation plan, and Mukherjee said their claims are not empty words.",
      "She said states already showed their power during the first Trump administration by blocking Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from entering courthouses for potential raids and denying the agency detainers that would have kept jailed immigrants in custody longer without an arraignment.",
      "She added that any attempts by the Republican-controlled Congress to change immigration and deportation laws to take away rights from the states will take some time and likely be met with resistance even among Republican members who think it is too extreme.",
      "\"The Trump administration will issue many executive orders, but a large number that will be illegal and unconstitutional,\" Mukherjee added.",
      "At the same time, Mukherjee said that conservative states and municipalities may bolster anti-immigrant policies and make it harder for migrants and asylum seekers to gain a path to citizenship.",
      "Sixty counties and police districts, many of them in Florida, have entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE, in which local law enforcement can conduct immigration policies on behalf of the federal government such as executing warrants and detaining undocumented immigrants, according to Mukherjee.",
      "Florida also passed SB 1718 last year which cracks down on undocumented immigration with several provisions, including making it illegal to transport undocumented immigrants and requiring hospitals to ask patients for their immigration status.",
      "Mukherjee stressed that states cannot try to enforce their own laws in other jurisdictions due to the 1842 Supreme Court case Prigg vs. Pennsylvania. That case, which overturned the conviction of a man convicted under a state law that prevented slave-catching, held that while federal law supersedes state law, states are not required to use their resources to uphold federal laws.",
      "\"It's extremely difficult and illegal for one state to impose their laws onto another,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "Even when it comes to executive orders, Mukherjee said the laws are mostly on the side of states and municipalities.",
      "Trump\u2019s \"border czar\" choice Tom Homan has already threatened to go after states and cities that refuse to comply with the president-elect's deportation plans, including arresting mayors.",
      "Mukherjee said there is no legal mechanism or modern legal precedent that allows the federal government to incarcerate local leaders for not adhering to an administration's policy.",
      "\"Sanctuary city laws are entirely allowed within the U.S. Constitution,\" she said. \"The 10th Amendment is extremely clear. The powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states or the people. This is a bedrock principle of U.S. constitutional law.\"",
      "State education officials are in the same boat when it comes to federal oversight, experts said.",
      "Although Trump and other allies have made it clear that they want to eliminate or weaken the federal Department of Education, funding for schools and education programs lies mostly in the hands of state legislatures and local school boards, according to Alice O'Brien, the general counsel for the National Education Association.",
      "\"Those campaign promises in reality are much harder to achieve,\" O'Brien told ABC News. \"They would require federal legislation to accomplish.\"",
      "Federal oversight has little control over local school curriculum policies, she added.",
      "O'Brien noted that much of the federal oversight on public schools lies outside of the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. For example, state school districts must adhere to laws set forth at the federal level such as non-discrimination against race and religion and disabilities.",
      "\"States and school systems can not run in any way that conflicts with the federal Constitution,\" O'Brien said.",
      "When it comes to funding, although the federal DOE does provide funding as a floor to many school districts, it is a small fraction compared to the funding that comes from city and state coffers, O'Brien explained.",
      "\"It really comes down to a state-by-state basis in terms of how much dollars are allocated to the schools,\" she said. \"Ultimately it really comes down to how much money the state budgets have.\"",
      "Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association and former Maryland health secretary, told ABC News that state public health offices operate under the same localized jurisdiction and thus would have more autonomy on health policies.",
      "Trump's pick for the head of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been a staunch promoter of anti-vaccination policies and has pushed for the end of fluoride in water supplies.",
      "Benjamin said he is worried about the effects of having someone with no professional health experience and public dismissiveness of proven health policies, however, he remarked that states and municipalities still hold immense power in implementing policies.",
      "Georges noted that fluoride levels in the water supply are dictated at a local level, and many counties have chosen not to implement them. Federal health agencies can make recommendations but cannot block a municipality from implementing fluoridation, he said.",
      "\"There is no fiscal penalty for not following it,\" Benjamin said of federal recommendations.",
      "The same rules govern local vaccination requirements, he added.",
      "\"[The federal government does] control vaccine mandates at the federal level, with the federal workforce, but they don't control the bulk of childhood mandates,\" Benjamin said.",
      "He noted that the country saw the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of state-run public health systems during the two years that COVID-19 hit the nation and the rollout of the vaccines. Republican and Democratic states all instituted shelter-in-place and social distancing rules during the peak of cases, Benjamin said.",
      "\"I do think we have a wait-and-see attitude,\" he said.",
      "In the meantime, several states have taken measures to bolster their state health policies, particularly when it comes to reproductive rights, through legislative action and ballot measures.",
      "One of the biggest ways that states will be able to \"Trump-proof\" their laws and policies is through state prosecutors and the courts, LaCroix said.",
      "\"We will see a lot of arguments in local government and what they can do,\" she said.",
      "Mukherjee said several state attorneys general were able to take Trump to court during his first administration and push back against immigration proposals such as his ban on residents from Muslim countries and deportation plans.",
      "Mukherjee said despite the increase in Trump-backed judges in the federal courts, there is still the rule of law when it comes to immigration. For example, earlier this year, a federal judge struck down the provision in Florida's SB 1718 that threatens felony charges for people who transport an undocumented immigrant.",
      "U.S. District Judge Roy Altman, a Trump-appointed judge, issued an injunction against that provision stating that immigration-related enforcement was not in the state's power.",
      "\"It will be harder this time around to win sweeping victories for immigrants and non-citizens ... but federal judges across party lines reined in the worst abuses of the Trump administration the first time around,\" she said.",
      "LaCroix echoed that statement and said that partisanship can only go so far, especially when it comes to laws enshrined in the state and federal constitutions.",
      "\"Judges still have to give reasons for what they do and 'because our party is in charge' doesn't hold weight,\" she said."

    "story": [
      "Mexico's president warned Trump against starting a trade war.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico on the first day of his administration could dramatically raise prices for Americans on everything from cars to clothes to oil.",
      "It could also blow up a trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico (USMCA) that went into effect in 2020 after extensive and intense negotiations by Trump's own administration.",
      "Trump late Monday said he would charge Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all products coming into the United States until action is taken by those country to stem illegal immigration and overflow of drugs across the border.",
      "For China, Trump said that he'd impose an additional 10% tariff on products coming to the U.S.",
      "Mexico, Canada and China are America's top three trading partners, meaning Trump's tariff plan would impact nearly every aspect of the U.S. economy.",
      "While it could very well be a negotiating tactic, similar to how Trump threatened tariffs in his first administration, experts say it won't be as effective this time around because countries know what's coming.",
      "\"This is more likely a play designed to put pressure on our closest trading partners,\" said Raymond Robertson, professor for trade, economics and public policy at Texas A&M University. \"But this is the same playbook done the second time around. If you're on the football field and you call the same play twice, it's not going to be as effective the second time.",
      "Robertson added that countries know this would be \"disruptive\" and a \"disaster\" but they've \"seen how this game works.\"",
      "Trading partners could seek closer ties to Europe and other countries and rely less on the United States, \"which means higher prices for us,\" Robertson said. He added the plan would also likely push Mexico and China closer together.",
      "\"Trump ran on this whole campaign that inflation is too high, but now he's going to put a tax on everything you buy,\" Robertson said.",
      "Most economists agree that tariffs are inflationary, by passing the higher cost of inputs to consumers. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Trump's proposed tariffs from the campaign trail would cost U.S. households more than $2,600 a year.",
      "The USMCA was signed by Trump as an update to North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.",
      "It allowed for mostly duty-free trade between the three countries. Trump's threat of tariffs would seem to violate the terms.",
      "Trump said on the campaign trail this year he wanted to renegotiate the USMCA by taking advantage of a window that allows for a review six years after signing. But that opportunity to renegotiate wouldn't come until 2026.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke with Trump on Monday night and \"it was a good call.\"",
      "\"We obviously talked about laying out the facts, talking about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,\" Trudeau said. \"We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together.\"",
      "Mexico\u2019s president, meanwhile, fired back at Trump and warned him not to start a trade war.",
      "\"President Trump, it is not with threats nor with tariffs that migration and drug consumption in the U.S. will be dealt with. These great challenges require cooperation and mutual understanding,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said at her daily press conference as she read aloud a letter her administration is sending Trump later Tuesday.",
      "The USMCA was a big deal for Trump -- a 2016 campaign promise he delivered and a major bipartisan achievement for his administration.",
      "During his first run for the White House he pledged to negotiate a better NAFTA, calling it one of the worst trade deals ever made.",
      "It took most of his term but he got a deal with the United States' neighbors to the north and south. And he signed it with great fanfare at the White House on Jan. 29, 2020, surrounded by Americans in uniforms, hard hats and cowboy hats.",
      "\"Everybody said this was a deal that could not be done -- too complicated, too big, couldn't be done. We got it done,\" Trump said that day.",

      "Trump appointed Elon Musk as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has vowed to dismantle thousands of federal regulations as the co-head of a new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says the nation\u2019s financial security depends on it.",
      "The U.S. risks \u201cstrangulation by regulation\u201d as it hurtles toward \u201cbankruptcy super fast,\u201d Musk said in a pair of posts on X this month.",
      "Musk\u2019s general concern about the nation\u2019s multi-trillion dollar debt reflects worry among many economists, and his slash-and-burn rhetoric mirrors that of close ally President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The ambitious cuts championed by Musk, however, could imperil an array of federal protections that safeguard against harm in just about every corner of American life, regulatory experts told ABC News.",
      "Regulations ensure air and water remain free of toxic pollution, workers receive safety gear and overtime pay, drugs undergo rigorous testing and corporations steer clear of ripping off customers.",
      "\"Revoking regulations or refusing to endorse them will endanger people\u2019s lives,\" Michael Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who specializes in environmental regulation, told ABC News. \"I'm very worried.\"",
      "In response to ABC News\u2019 request for comment, the Trump transition team touted the involvement of Musk and his plans for streamlining U.S. government.",
      "\u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency,\u201d Brian Hughes, a transition spokesperson, told ABC News.",
      "What does DOGE aim to do?",
      "DOGE, the commission co-led by Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, plans to recommend a \u201cvast reduction\u201d of federal regulations, the two leaders said in a joint op-ed in The Wall Street Journal last week.",
      "Such regulatory cuts would diminish the workload of government agencies, allowing for a significant reduction of federal workers and department budgets, the DOGE leaders said. They recommended a mandate that all federal workers come to the office five days a week, which they claimed would trigger a wave of resignations.",
      "\u201cNow is the moment for decisive action,\u201d Musk and Ramaswamy said, but the pair did not identify specific regulations that they would like to cut.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. Neither did Ramaswamy.",
      "The promise of regulatory cuts may prove more compelling as a declaration of war against the status quo than a nitty-gritty elimination of individual rules, experts said. They pointed to significant legal hurdles faced in unwinding government regulations, as well as the lack of direct authority available to DOGE, a non-governmental entity.",
      "Plus, the experts added, many government regulations involve direct protections of importance to a swath of Americans.",
      "Air pollution, heat safety among potential regulatory cuts",
      "Some experts pointed for instance to an air-quality standard put in place by the Biden administration in February. The regulation lowered the amount of particulate matter air pollution -- commonly known as soot -- allowable in the nation\u2019s air.",
      "The rule would prevent as many as 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, an Environmental Protection Agency study found. Those health benefits could translate into as much as $46 billion in savings by 2032, the agency said.",
      "The Trump administration may seek to undo the rule as part of wider regulatory cuts, Gerrard said. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to cut environmental regulations in an effort to ease the burden on businesses, but he did not mention this specific rule. Trump rolled back nearly 100 environmental regulations during his first term, including rules governing clean air, a New York Times analysis found.",
      "Darren Riley, co-founder of an air-quality data startup called JustAir, who was diagnosed with asthma six years ago, said air safety should transcend party politics.",
      "\u201cWe should take whatever precautions and procedures necessary to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink as a right to life,\u201d Riley told ABC News.",
      "Workplace safety marks another focus of federal regulation that could draw scrutiny from the Trump administration.",
      "In July, the Biden administration formally proposed a heat-safety rule that would require workplaces with elevated heat risks to provide adequate water, rest breaks and control of indoor temperature.",
      "Shae Parker suffered from dizziness and nausea during bouts of heat exhaustion while working this summer at a Speedway gas station in Columbia, South Carolina, she told ABC News. One year prior, record heat in the area caused similar symptoms during Parker\u2019s shifts at Waffle House, but management failed to provide adequate air conditioning, she said.",
      "Parker has traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for the heat safety rule, and she worries that the Trump administration may set aside the regulation.",
      "\u201cTrump really needs to set the heat standard, and if he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t care about the country,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe needs to take our lives seriously.\u201d",
      "Waffle House did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. Neither did 7-11, the parent company of Speedway.",
      "Over three decades ending in the early 2020s, nearly 1,000 workers in the U.S. died from excessive heat exposure, amounting to about 34 deaths per year, an EPA study in June found.",
      "The proposed regulation is in the midst of a public comment period as part of the rule-making process. That phase ends in December, leaving little time for finalization and implementation of the measure before Trump takes office. The Trump administration may very well abandon the rule, experts told ABC News.",
      "\u201cWorkers will be on their own when it comes to heat,\u201d Debbie Berkowitz, a former official in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration under then-President Barack Obama, told ABC News.",
      "For his part, Musk previously said DOGE would incorporate feedback from everyday people about which regulations it would recommend cutting. \u201cAnytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!\u201d Musk said in a post on X earlier this month.",
      "Musk has also said that the nation\u2019s worsening debt will force an increased portion of U.S. tax payments to go to interest payments on such borrowing, rather than to government services.",
      "William Buzbee, a professor of administrative law at Georgetown University who focuses on environmental regulation, said the outcome of Musk\u2019s efforts remains highly unclear. But he will likely face legal pushback as well as backlash from people who would be impacted by the potential rollback of a given regulation.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, yes, the Trump administration is quite clearly planning to go in a deregulatory direction,\u201d Buzbee said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d",

      "An estimated 42% of Americans struggle with obesity, the White House says.",
      "The Biden administration has proposed a new rule to \u201csignificantly\u201d expand coverage of anti-obesity medications for Americans with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the White House.",
      "\u201cOver the past few years, there have been major scientific advancements in the treatment of obesity, with the introduction of new life-saving drugs,\u201d the White House said in a statement released on Tuesday. \u201cThese anti-obesity medications can help prevent the development of Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, these drugs reduce deaths and sickness from heart attack and other cardiovascular outcomes by up to 20%. But for too many Americans, these critical treatments are too expensive and therefore out of reach. Without insurance coverage, these drugs can cost someone as much as $1,000 a month.\u201d",
      "Millions of Americans struggle with obesity -- an estimated 42%, according to the White House -- and it is now widely recognized as a chronic disease with increased risk of all-cause mortality and multiple related comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and some cancers.",
      "Medicare and Medicaid currently cover the use of anti-obesity medication for certain conditions, like diabetes. But the new proposal on Tuesday would \u201cexpand access to these innovative medications for obesity, which is widely recognized as a disease and help an estimated 3.4 million Americans with Medicare,\u201d the White House said.",
      "\u201cMedicare coverage would reduce out-of-pocket costs for these prescription drugs by as much as 95 percent for some enrollees. Approximately 4 million adult Medicaid enrollees would also gain new access to these medications,\u201d the White House continued.",
      "The proposal would \u201callow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\u201d White House officials said.",
      "The proposed rule would be implemented at the same time as a comprehensive agenda to lower the costs of drugs, including the drug price negotiation program and increased market competition.",
      "\u201cThanks to the President\u2019s efforts, seniors are already seeing lower prescription drug costs with insulin capped at $35, free vaccines, and out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs capped at $2,000 starting in 2025,\u201d the Biden administration said. \u201cAlready this year, nearly 1.5 million people with Medicare Part D saved nearly $1 billion in out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs in the first half of 2024 because of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Furthermore, HHS has reached agreement with drug manufacturers for the first ten negotiated drugs, with new prices that are reduced between 38 to 79 percent starting in 2026.\u201d",

      "\"Democrats know to take nothing for granted right now,\" one strategist said.",
      "Democrats suffered a knockout punch in this month's elections. New Jersey's and Virginia's off-year gubernatorial elections in 2025 offer them their first chances to get off the mat.",
      "Both states have become reliably blue in federal races, but President-elect Donald Trump narrowed his margins in each state, and Democrats are unable to take anything for granted as they undergo a postelection reckoning over their national brand. New Jerseyans haven't granted one party more than eight straight years in the governor's mansion in over five decades, and Republican Glenn Youngkin rode into Richmond just three years ago.",
      "That makes the contests to replace term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, in New Jersey and Youngkin, who can't run for two consecutive terms, in Virginia key barometers for Democrats' ability to find their way out of the political wilderness ahead of the midterm elections in 2026.",
      "\"I think both these are going to be competitive races. Democrats know to take nothing for granted right now,\" said Jared Leopold, a former Democratic Governors Association staffer based in Virginia. \"Gubernatorial races have always been the path back for a party out of power, and 2025 is no different. So, this is going to be a huge opportunity for the Democratic Party.\"",
      "Both races are in the early stages, with candidates still throwing their hats into the ring.",
      "New Jersey Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, former state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller are among the Democrats running to replace Murphy. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is the top Democrat running in Virginia and is widely considered a party powerhouse in the state.",
      "Republicans are also sifting through their own candidates. Former GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, who fell short of unseating Murphy by about 3 points in 2021, is running again in New Jersey, as are other candidates who are casting themselves as more aligned with and antagonistic toward Trump's brand. And Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running for the governor's mansion with Youngkin's endorsement.",
      "But it's Democrats who are on the outside looking in these days, having lost the White House and Senate this month, and eager to bounce back.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Trump has set off recriminations among Democrats that the party has lost touch with working-class voters and instead reinforced an elitist, out-of-touch brand that was so unpalatable that voters instead opted for a twice-impeached former president who had been convicted of 34 felonies in New York.",
      "Warning signs loomed this month specifically in New Jersey and Virginia. Trump stunned when he became the first Republican presidential candidate in over 30 years to win racially diverse Passaic County in New Jersey. And he made inroads in northern Virginia, the suburban machine of Democrats' statewide advantage.",
      "Many of the leading Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia have sought to create distance with the party's left-flank and prioritized affordability over social issues, a possibly effective strategy after voters prioritized economic issues and Trump blanketed the airwaves with ads attacking Harris over her position on transgender issues.",
      "Now, they just have to convince voters that they're not like the national Democratic bogeymen they've heard so much about.",
      "\"I think they will be talking the talk. The question is, how can they convince voters that they are walking the walk, and how can they convince voters that this is the centerpiece of their campaign?\" said Micah Rasmussen, who served as press secretary for former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey, a Democrat.",
      "\"If you can convince voters that you've gotten the message and that you need to focus not so much what you want to focus on but you want to focus on what the voters want you to focus on, that's what it's going to take,\" he added. \"I certainly think, at this point, the candidates have gotten the message.\"",
      "Democrats in both states have gotten something of a head start over their national counterparts.",
      "Murphy's narrower-than-expected win over Ciattarelli in 2021 alarmed Democrats who had expected to coast in New Jersey but were instead rebuffed by voters' complaints about affordability in the high-tax state. And Youngkin's win in a state that President Joe Biden won by 10 points just a year earlier jolted Democrats there, too.",
      "In hindsight, both results may have foreshadowed the post-COVID-19 economic frustrations that sunk Democrats this year.",
      "Now, candidates are putting the economy first. \"Let's make life more affordable for hardworking New Jerseyans, from health care to groceries to child care,\" Sherrill said in her announcement video. Spanberger touts efforts aimed at \"lowering prescription drug prices\" and \"lowering costs and easing inflation.\"",
      "Republicans, for their part, are feeling their oats.",
      "While Trump won each swing state by narrow margins, he did sweep them, and he made notable gains among Democratic-friendly demographic groups and in blue states, including New Jersey and Virginia. And almost nothing is as unifying as winning.",
      "\"There's an opportunity for sure, and being unified, that's step one,\" Virginia-based GOP strategist Zack Roday said. \"If your party sweeps the House, Senate and the White House, you want to try to just hold your serve downballot and compete, and I think we can actually compete to win at the top. Democrats have the advantage, but there's a lot around the coalition that could be united in both states that is really appealing to where the GOP is.\"",
      "It's not all doom and gloom for Democrats, though.",
      "Democrats performed well in off-year elections in 2017 after Trump's first win and in the 2018 midterm elections, and New Jerseyans in particular have traditionally been reluctant to elevate Republicans the year after a Republican wins the White House. And while Trump was able to juice the base and cut into his opponent's advantages, he still fell short in two states where Democrats retain voter registration edges.",
      "\"I don't think that anyone's sitting around panicking right now about where the election is. There's certainly work to do, but there's no panic,\" one senior New Jersey Democratic strategist said.",
      "Trump could also supercharge Democrats' push to coalesce after their losses this month. His policy proposals, including banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries in 2017, infuriated the Democratic base, leading to Democratic successes in 2017 and 2018.",
      "\"It really started when Trump started doing really controversial, unpopular things, like the Muslim ban, and that's when you saw governors and people come together to fight back against him. My suspicion is that same trend will happen here, where the reality of Trump's policies will galvanize Democrats,\" Leopold said.",
      "However, he added, for a party that's still smarting after its shortcomings this month, no race is considered safe, and Democrats will have their work cut out for them despite the friendly terrain.",
      "Leopold noted that \"2025 is a huge step on the path back for Democrats. We can lick our wounds for the rest of 2024, but come 2025, we got to get focused.\""

    "summary": "President-elect Trump asked his top advisers to conduct an internal investigation into alleged claims of impropriety by his top legal adviser Boris Epshteyn, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Epshteyn allegedly sought payment from those interested in administration spots.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump directed his top advisers to conduct an internal investigation into alleged claims of impropriety by his top legal adviser Boris Epshteyn, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The allegations from top allies of the president-elect and individuals close to his transition team claimed that Epshteyn used his position of proximity to Trump to seek financial compensation, claiming he could potentially secure positions for certain individuals in the administration.",
      "An internal investigation conducted by lawyers for Trump preliminarily found a pattern of behavior with Epshteyn that was concerning, sources said.",
      "The review allegedly found that Epshteyn would offer access to Trump in exchange for monthly consulting fees. The review by Trump's lawyers concluded that Epshteyn's alleged conduct should result in termination of his employment and proximity to Trump.",
      "It's not clear if the report was ever delivered to Trump and as of Monday evening Epshteyn still appeared to be employed by Trump.",
      "\"I am honored to work for President Trump and with his team,\" Epshteyn told ABC News. \"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again.\"",
      "The internal investigation was first reported by CNN.",
      "In a sworn declaration submitted to Trump's transition team and obtained by ABC News, former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens said that he contacted Epshteyn following the election to mention his interest in serving in Trump's administration, and -- despite the absence of an explicit offer -- Greitens said that Epshteyn's \"comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in subsequent discussion.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the review by Trump's lawyers found that the day after Trump met with Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent for the first time in February, Epshteyn invited him to lunch and asked Bessent for a monthly stipend of at least $30,000 to promote Bessent around Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.",
      "Epshteyn also tried to get Bessent to invest $10 million in a 3-on-3 basketball league -- an offer that Bessent refused.",
      "Bessent, who did not pay Epshteyn, came to believe that if he had followed through he would have been treated in a more favorable manner by Ephsteyn, sources said.",
      "Bessent could not be reached for comment.",
      "Speaking to Just the News, a conservative publication, Trump reacted to the allegations saying he wasn't aware that anyone who worked for him was soliciting consulting fees.",
      "\"I suppose every president has people around them who try to make money off them on the outside. It's a shame, but it happens,\" Trump said. \"But no one working for me in any capacity should be looking to make money. They should only be here to Make America Great Again.\"",
      "\"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung said. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",

    "title": "How Trump and Hegseth could change the US military and the challenges they might face",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:11:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to head the Pentagon, wants major changes to the U.S. military. Here's how DOD could be affected.",
    "story": [
      "Here's where Pete Hegseth's impact on the Pentagon could be significant.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, have proposed major changes to the U.S. military, leading to questions about how the department could be affected in a second Trump administration.",
      "Here are five areas that could see significant impact, as well as the obstacles such initiatives could face.",
      "Ahead of his selection by Trump to lead the DOD, Hegseth spoke out against women serving in ground combat roles.",
      "\"I love women service members, who contribute amazingly,\" Hegseth said during a podcast appearance earlier this month. But three minutes later, he added, \"I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"",
      "\"It is our understanding that it is theoretically possible for the executive branch to roll back the rules allowing women to serve in combat units,\" a congressional aide told ABC News on Monday.",
      "While Congress could move to create a law enshrining female combat service, \"it doesn\u2019t exist at the moment,\u201d the aide said.",
      "Getting such a law passed could be an uphill battle, and even a law might not be enough, according to Lory Manning, former director of government operations for the Service Women's Action Network, who has long focused on the issue.",
      "\"The services could ignore it,\" Manning said of a potential law. \"Whether there's a law or not, there's a way around it.\"",
      "Of the active-duty military personnel, 17.5% are women, and women make up 21.6% of the selected reserve, according to the Pentagon's latest statistics. Thousands of women have now served in combat roles.",
      "Allowing women to serve in ground combat units was triggered both by laws enacted by Congress and policy decisions, beginning with the 1948\u2019s Women\u2019s Armed Services Integration Act.",
      "The act allowed women to serve in the U.S. military but had limits on the percentage of women in the force and prohibited them from serving in combat. Things stayed in place up until the early 1990s, when then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin rescinded the \"Risk Rule\" and allowed women to serve as pilots in all types of situations, including combat.",
      "There weren\u2019t any further changes for another two decades, until 2013 and 2016, when the DOD made policy changes triggered by another law, the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. That legislation required the DOD to \u201cconduct a review of laws, policies, and regulations that may restrict the service of female members of the Armed Forces; and ... report review results.\u201d",
      "Those reviews led Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to lift what was known as the \u201cground combat exclusion rule.\" His action and the 2016 action by Defense Secretary Ash Carter were policy decisions, which means they could be changed by future defense secretaries.",
      "Hegseth has said he is not against women serving as combat pilots or in female engagement teams on the ground, but if confirmed as secretary of defense he could give an order to close other combat jobs that were opened by his predecessors, like those in the infantry and special operations forces.",
      "Hegseth, who would need to be confirmed by the Senate before becoming secretary, has suggested the firing of America's top military officer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. CQ Brown. He has likewise called for the removal of other senior officers, particularly those involved in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan or \"woke\" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "\"First of all, you got to fire the chairman Joint of the Chiefs and obviously going to bring in a new secretary of defense, but any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in any of the DEI woke s--- has got to go,\" Hegseth said during an interview days before being nominated. \"Either you're in for war-fighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"",
      "The president has a lot of latitude here. While there could be legal challenges in trying to outright kick generals or admirals out of the military, should they refuse a request to resign, the commander in chief has the authority to remove any general from their current position and reassign them.",
      "Three- and four-star generals or admirals only hold those ranks while in certain senior leadership roles. So, if they are reassigned to a lesser position, it would mean at minimum a reduction in rank, which would in turn mean a reduction in pay then and in retirement. And such relief of command is generally a career-ender.",
      "A president can only fully dismiss an officer during times of war. Otherwise, a court-martial process is required, according to U.S. code.",
      "Still, an officer's influence and career path could be completely derailed at the discretion of the president, even without total dismissal.",
      "In 2016, the Pentagon under then-President Barack Obama lifted restrictions on transgender people serving in the armed forces. But in 2017, Trump announced on what was then Twitter that transgender service members would no longer be able to serve openly in the armed forces, citing concerns over costs and readiness. The policy was implemented in 2019 and required transgender service members to serve in line with their biological sex unless they had already successfully transitioned or were grandfathered in under the Obama-era policy.",
      "In 2021, the Trump policy was reversed under the Biden administration, allowing transgender service members to again serve openly and access related medical care.",
      "\"This change to the standards meant that men and women could join the military for the express purpose of transitioning, be nondeployable for a year, and take life-altering hormone therapy that would mean they would be nondeployable unless the military could guarantee the supply of medication,\" Hegseth said of the changes under Biden in one of his books.",
      "When he retakes office, Trump could reinstate his transgender military ban by executive order to the DOD by again citing cost or readiness concerns, which in turn would likely trigger new legal challenges.",
      "A Rand study commissioned by the Obama administration in 2015 estimated gender-transition care would cost the department between $2.4 million and $8.4 million per year, a small fraction of a percent increase to total military health expenditures. The study also found that postoperative recovery and other transition-related factors could limit service members' ability to deploy, but it noted that because only a small number of troops would be likely to transition, the overall impact to military readiness would be minimal.",
      "In Trump's first term, several lawsuits were filed in federal court arguing the ban violated constitutional protections, with courts issuing injunctions to block the policy temporarily while litigation continued.",
      "Then, in early 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect, with some exceptions, while legal appeals continued. Lower courts were divided, and those service restrictions remained in place until the Biden reversal.",
      "If Trump does try to restrict transgender service, it's likely that the outcome will depend on the courts. The GOP in Congress could try to codify a transgender ban in law, but this would face its own hurdles.",
      "After Roe v. Wade was overruled, the Pentagon under Biden created a policy aiming to allow service members stationed in states that had banned abortions to have access to the procedure. The policy offers women paid time off and reimbursement for travel costs to receive abortions and other reproductive health care out of state.",
      "Trump would have the power to rescind the policy. The president has broad authority to dictate administrative military policies such as leave, travel and health care. Lawsuits could still arise but might have a low chance of succeeding since there's no federal law mandating the abortion travel policy.",
      "Just last month, Trump vowed to change Fort Liberty, an Army base in North Carolina, back to Fort Bragg, named after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg. A possible complication to Trump's promise is that the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act established a law requiring that Confederate names be removed from military installations.",
      "However, although that legislation mandated the removal of Confederate names, it did not eliminate the naming authority of the executive branch, leaving open the possibility of a power struggle between the White House and Congress in the future.",

      "Travel, especially during the holiday season, can be stressful",
      "Travel can be stressful in the best of times. Now add in the high-level anxiety that seems to be baked into every holiday season and it's clear that travelers could use some help calming frazzled nerves.",
      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

      "Online court records show Valdivia now faces felony and misdemeanor charges, including two counts of second-degree rape. The dates of the alleged offenses are in May 2024 and September 2024.",
      "Defense attorney Robert Bonsib, who represented Valdivia in the shooting case, confirmed that his client was arrested Monday on sexual assault charges.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t accept at first blush any of the allegations until all of the evidence is in,\" Bonsib said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Montgomery County Police Department identified Valdivia as the arrested FBI agent without commenting on his connection to the shooting.",
      "Police detectives believe there may be additional victims, and they're planning a news conference on Tuesday \u201cto encourage them to come forward,\u201d the department said in a statement. Police didn't immediately release any other information about the charges.",
      "Valdivia, 40, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was ordered held in custody after his initial court appearance on Monday, Bonsib said. Valdivia is scheduled to return to court Tuesday for a bond hearing before a judge, Bonsib said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia joined the FBI in 2011 and was promoted to supervisory special agent at the FBI headquarters in 2019. The attorney said Valdivia had been working as an FBI agent since his acquittal.",
      "On Dec. 15, 2020, a confrontation between Valdivia and an unarmed passenger swiftly escalated from a testy exchange of words to a shooting on a train approaching the Medical Center station in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Valdivia shot and wounded the man from a distance of roughly 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) after repeatedly telling the man to back up, county prosecutor Robert Hill said in court. The wounded man had part or all of his spleen, colon and pancreas removed during surgery after the shooting, Hill said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia acted in self-defense as the man approached him at the rear of a train car.",
      "\u201cThe law does not require that you wait to be struck before you take action. Had this resulted in a hands-on fight and a struggle for Agent Valdivia\u2019s gun, only God knows what could have happened,\u201d Bonsib said after Valdivia was charged."

    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks rose to records after Donald Trump\u2019s latest talk about tariffs created only some ripples on Wall Street",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rose to records Tuesday after Donald Trump\u2019s latest talk about tariffs created only some ripples on Wall Street, even if they could roil the global economy  were they to take effect.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to top the all-time high  it set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 123 points, or 0.3%, to its own record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6% as Microsoft and Big Tech led the way.",
      "Stock markets abroad mostly fell after President-elect Trump said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China once he takes office. But the movements were mostly modest. Stock indexes were down 0.1% in Shanghai and nearly flat in Hong Kong, while Canada\u2019s main index edged down by less than 0.1%.",
      "Trump has often praised the use of tariffs, but investors are weighing whether his latest threat will actually become policy or is just an opening point for negotiations. For now, the market seems to be taking it more as the latter.",
      "The consequences otherwise for markets and the global economy could be painful.",
      "Unless the United States can prepare alternatives for the autos, energy products and other goods that come from Mexico, Canada and China, such tariffs would raise the price of imported items all at once and make households poorer, according to Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi, economists at High Frequency Economics.",
      "They would also hurt profit margins for U.S. companies, while raising the threat of retaliatory tariffs by other countries. And unlike tariffs in Trump\u2019s first term, his latest proposal would affect products across the board.",
      "General Motors sank 9%, and Ford Motor fell 2.6% because both import automobiles from Mexico. Constellation Brands, which sells Modelo and other Mexican beer brands in the United States, dropped 3.3%. The value of the Mexican peso fell 1.8% against the U.S. dollar.",
      "Beyond the pain such tariffs would cause U.S. households and businesses, they could also push the Federal Reserve to slow or even halt its cuts to interest rates. The Fed had just begun easing its main interest rate  from a two-decade high a couple months ago to offer support for the job market. While lower interest rates can boost the economy, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",
      "\u201cMany\u201d officials at the Fed\u2019s last meeting earlier this month said they should lower rates gradually, according to minutes of the meeting  released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The talk about tariffs overshadowed another mixed set of profit reports from U.S. retailers that answered few questions about how much more shoppers can keep spending. They\u2019ll need to stay resilient after helping the economy avoid a recession, despite the high interest rates imposed by the Fed to get inflation under control.",
      "A report on Tuesday from the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved in November, but not by as much as economists expected.",
      "Kohl\u2019s tumbled 17% after its results for the latest quarter fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. CEO Tom Kingsbury said sales remain soft for apparel and footwear. A day earlier, Kingsbury said he plans to step down as CEO in January. Ashley Buchanan, CEO of Michaels and a retail veteran, will replace him.",
      "Best Buy fell 4.9% after likewise falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods topped forecasts for the latest quarter thanks to a strong back-to-school season, but its stock lost an early gain to fall 1.4%.",
      "Still, more stocks rose in the S&P 500 than fell. J.M. Smucker had one of the biggest gains and climbed 5.7% after topping analysts\u2019 expectations for the latest quarter. CEO Mark Smucker credited strength for its Uncrustables, Meow Mix, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Jif brands.",
      "Big Tech stocks  also helped prop up U.S. indexes. Gains of 3.2% for Amazon and 2.2% for Microsoft were the two strongest forces lifting the S&P 500.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.26 points to 6,021.63. The Dow gained 123.74 to 44,860.31, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 119.46 to 19,174.30.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady following their big drop from a day before driven by relief following Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury inched up to 4.29% from 4.28% late Monday, but it\u2019s still well below the 4.41% level where it ended last week.",
      "In the crypto market, bitcoin continued to pull back after topping $99,000 for the first time  late last week. It\u2019s since dipped back toward $91,000, according to CoinDesk.",

      "Segments of \u201cCity News\u201d will highlight New Orleans\u2019 \u201crich culture, diverse communities, and untold stories,\u201d the administration said in a news release.",

      "Williams will co-host the program with Raven Frederick, a digital communications director on Cantrell\u2019s staff. Steven Martinez, a multimedia manager for the city, will work on production. The release also named three producers. It was unclear if they were already city employees.",
      "Cantrell for months has avoided attention from traditional media outlets amid a federal investigation and political challenges from the City Council.",

      "Nebraska has moved closer to allowing medical marijuana",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Three weeks after Nebraska voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana the state moved a step closer to allowing it Tuesday when a judge ruled that the petitions that put the question on the ballot were valid.",
      "The decision by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong was a victory for advocates of medical marijuana, but opponents are likely to appeal it to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTo prevail in this action, the plaintiff and Secretary had to show that more than 3,463 signatures on the Legalization Petition and 3,357 signatures on the Regulatory Petition are invalid. The Plaintiff and Secretary are well short,\u201d Strong wrote. Fewer than 1,000 signatures on each petition were shown to be invalid.",
      "A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general said the office\u2019s lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering whether to file an appeal.",
      "Medical marijuana supporters didn't immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday after the ruling was released.",
      "More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalization at the polls Nov. 5. The results are scheduled to be certified Dec. 2.",
      "Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers argued that problems with the way thousands of signatures were gathered meant the ballot initiatives shouldn\u2019t have been put to voters. One person who circulated petitions in Grand Island was criminally charged with falsifying at least 164 signatures. Evnen, Hilgers and former state Sen. John Kuehn also raised questions about whether other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana argued in court that even if some of the signatures gathered were flawed, the group still had well over the 86,499 needed. The Secretary of State's office certified nearly 90,000 signatures on both the petition to allow marijuana for medical use and the one to set up a commission to regulate it.",
      "The judge agreed that the state wasn't able to show any widespread fraud. Instead the ruling pointed primarily to the one petition circulator who was charged and raised questions about whether some other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Strong said she reviewed thousands of messages that top two organizers of the petition campaign exchanged that filled more than 800 pages and only found one mention of notarizing petitions outside of the petition circulator's presence.",
      "This year marked the third time Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana tried to get the issue on the ballot and the first time it made it there.",
      "In 2020, the group came close after meeting signature requirements. But opponents sued, arguing that advocates violated state rules requiring ballot measures to focus on a single question. Instead, the measure posed two separate questions: whether residents should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes, and whether private companies should be allowed to grow and sell it.",
      "The state Supreme Court prevented the questions from going to voters.",
      "In 2022, organizers failed to collect enough signatures in time to get the question on the November ballot.",
      "Voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida all rejected measures to legalize recreational marijuana use this year. But dozens of states have previously legalized it for either medical or recreational use, most recently in Ohio last year. In May, the federal government also began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug."

      "LONDON -- A suspected animal rights extremist wanted in the U.S. for bombings in the San Francisco area was arrested in Britain after more than 20 years on the run from the law, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Daniel Andreas San Diego, one of the FBI\u2019s most wanted fugitives, was arrested Monday in a rural area in northern Wales, the National Crime Agency said. He was ordered held in custody after appearing Tuesday in Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court and faces extradition.",
      "San Diego, 46, is charged in the U.S. with planting two bombs that exploded about an hour apart in the early morning of Aug. 28, 2003, on the campus of a biotechnology company in Emeryville, California. He\u2019s also accused of setting off another bomb with nails strapped to it at a nutritional products company in Pleasanton, California, a month later.",
      "The bombings didn't injure anyone, but authorities said the bomb at the biotechnology company was intended to harm first responders.",
      "A group called Revolutionary Cells-Animal Liberation Brigade claimed responsibility for the bombings, citing the companies\u2019 ties to Huntingdon Life Sciences. Huntingdon was a target of animal rights extremists because of its work with experimental drugs and chemicals on animals while under contract for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other companies.",
      "\u201cDaniel San Diego\u2019s arrest after more than 20 years as a fugitive for two bombings in the San Francisco area shows that no matter how long it takes, the FBI will find you and hold you accountable,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to express your views in our country, and turning to violence and destruction of property is not the right way.\u201d",
      "In 2009, San Diego became the first person suspected of domestic terrorism to be added to the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted Terrorist List. A reward of $250,000 (200,000 pounds) was offered for information leading to his arrest.",
      "Photos of him appeared on billboards from California to New York, including Times Square, the FBI said. He was featured on the TV program \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d several times.",

      "San Diego had worked as a computer network specialist, was a skilled sailor and was known to carry a handgun, the FBI said.",
      "The FBI had San Diego under surveillance on Oct. 6, 2003 when he parked his car near downtown San Francisco, and vanished into a transit station \u2014 not to be seen again.",
      "There had been numerous sightings reported around the world and investigators announced searches at times as far apart as Massachusetts and Hawaii.",
      "The NCA said it arrested San Diego at a property near woods in the Conwy area of Wales, a coastal area some 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) from San Francisco. No other details were provided."

      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technolog...",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technology that the Biden administration already uses to help make crucial decisions in tracking, detaining and ultimately deporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status.",
      "While immigration officials have used the tech for years, an October letter from the Department of Homeland Security obtained exclusively by The Associated Press details how those tools \u2014 some of them powered by AI \u2014 help make decisions over whether an immigrant should be detained or surveilled.",
      "One algorithm, for example, ranks immigrants with a \u201cHurricane Score,\u201d ranging from 1-5, to assess whether someone will \u201cabscond\u201d from the agency's supervision.",
      "The letter, sent by DHS Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen to the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law, revealed that the score calculates the potential risk that an immigrant \u2014 with a pending case \u2014 will fail to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The algorithm relies on several factors, he said, including an immigrant\u2019s number of violations and length of time in the program, and whether the person has a travel document. Hysen wrote that ICE officers consider the score, among other information, when making decisions about an immigrant\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cThe Hurricane Score does not make decisions on detention, deportation, or surveillance; instead, it is used to inform human decision-making,\u201d Hysen wrote.",
      "Also included in the government\u2019s tool kit is a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial matching and can track an immigrant\u2019s specific location.",
      "Nearly 200,000 people without legal status who are in removal proceedings are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention program, under which certain immigrants can live in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "In exchange, SmartLINK and GPS trackers used by ICE rigorously surveil them and their movements. The phone application draws on facial matching technology and geolocation data, which has been used before to find and arrest those using the app.",
      "Just Futures Law wrote to Hysen earlier this year, questioning the fairness of using an algorithm to assess whether someone is a flight risk and raising concerns over how much data SmartLINK collects. Such AI systems, which score or screen people, are used widely but remain largely unregulated even though some have been found to discriminate on race, gender or other protected traits.",
      "DHS said in an email that it is committed to ensuring that its use of AI is transparent and safeguards privacy and civil rights while avoiding biases. The agency said it is working to implement the Biden administration\u2019s requirements on using AI, but Hysen said in his letter that security officials may waive those requirements for certain uses. Trump has publicly vowed to repeal Biden's AI policy when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cDHS uses AI to assist our personnel in their work, but DHS does not use the outputs of AI systems as the sole basis for any law enforcement action or denial of benefits,\u201d a spokesperson for DHS told the AP.",
      "Trump has not revealed how he plans to carry out his promised deportation of an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Although he has proposed invoking wartime powers, as well as military involvement, the plan would face major logistical challenges \u2014 such as where to keep those who have been detained and how to find people spread across the country \u2014 that AI-powered surveillance tools could potentially address.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer questions about how the incoming administration plans to use DHS\u2019 tech, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation\u201d in American history.",
      "Over 100 civil society groups sent a letter on Friday urging the Office of Management and Budget to require DHS to comply with the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines. A spokesperson for OMB said that agencies must align their AI tools with the guidelines by December 1, and that any extensions or waivers of that deadline will be publicly disclosed next month.",
      "Just Futures Law\u2019s executive director, Paromita Shah, said if immigrants are scored as flight risks, they are more likely to remain in detention, \"limiting their ability to prepare a defense in their case in immigration court, which is already difficult enough as it is.\u201d",
      "SmartLINK, part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison company The GEO Group. The GEO Group also contracts with ICE to run detention centers.",
      "ICE is tight-lipped about how it uses SmartLINK\u2019s location feature to find and arrest immigrants. Still, public records show that during Trump\u2019s first term in 2018, Manassas, Virginia-based employees of BI Inc. relayed immigrants\u2019 GPS locations to federal authorities, who then arrested over 40 people.",
      "In a report last year to address privacy issues and concerns, DHS said that the mobile app includes security features that \u201cprohibit access to information on the participant\u2019s mobile device, with the exception of location data points when the app is open.\u201d",
      "But the report notes that there remains a risk that data collected from people \"may be misused for unauthorized persistent monitoring.\u201d",
      "Such information could also be stored in other ICE and DHS databases and used for other DHS mission purposes, the report said.",
      "On investor calls earlier this month, private prison companies were clear-eyed about the opportunities ahead.",
      "The GEO Group\u2019s executive chairman George Christopher Zoley said that he expects the incoming Trump administration to \u201ctake a much more aggressive approach regarding border security as well as interior enforcement and to request additional funding from Congress to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn GEO\u2019s ISAP program, we can scale up from the present 182,500 participants to several hundreds of thousands, or even millions of participants,\u201d Zoley said.",
      "That same day, the head of another private prison company told investors he would be watching closely to see how the new administration may change immigrant monitoring programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for multiple vendors to engage ICE about the program going forward and think about creative and innovative solutions to not only get better outcomes, but also scale up the program as necessary,\u201d Damon Hininger, CEO of the private prison company CoreCivic Inc. said on an earnings call.",
      "GEO did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, CoreCivic said that it has played \u201ca valued but limited role in America\u2019s immigration system\u201d for both Democrats and Republicans for over 40 years."

      "The move comes 18 months after a Los Angeles County judge threw out much of the 2022 suit in which Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, claimed Wood had fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to fabricate their own allegations.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of fighting a battle where he was able to tell the truth, Brian is pleased to dismiss his still-pending claims and appeal in order to close the door on this chapter of his life,\" Manson attorney Howard King said in a statement.",
      "Manson had been appealing the judge's decision but his attorneys reached out to Wood's seeking a settlement in the spring. Wood's attorneys said Tuesday that she rejected requests that the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Manson \u201cfiled a lawsuit against Ms. Wood as a publicity stunt to try to undermine the credibility of his many accusers and revive his faltering career,\u201d Wood\u2019s lawyer Michael J. Kump said in a statement. \u201cBut his attempt to silence and intimidate Ms. Wood failed.\u201d",
      "Manson agreed to pay nearly $327,000 in attorney fees for Wood.",
      "The settlement comes nearly four years into a criminal investigation of the 55-year-old Manson involving multiple women that remains unresolved. Outgoing LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in October that his office's sex crimes division had just discovered new evidence and that a decision on whether to file charges would be made when the picture was more complete.",
      "The women involved in the criminal case have not been identified, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esme Bianco has said she was among them, and criticized the district attorney for taking so long to investigate. Bianco settled her own lawsuit against Manson last year.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Wood and Bianco have.",
      "Manson has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual acts.",
      "In 2017, with the #MeToo movement gaining momentum, Wood said publicly that she had been raped and abused, and gave testimony on the subject to a Congressional committee in 2018, but did not name anyone in either instance.",
      "Then in a 2020 Instagram post, Wood said it was Manson who had \u201chorrifically abused me for years.\u201d The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "Manson's original lawsuit alleged that Wood and another woman, Ashley Gore, also known as Illma Gore in court papers, defamed him, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say. The suit said Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denied forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.",
      "Other parts of the lawsuit had remained because they were not subject to Wood\u2019s motion, including allegations that Gore hacked Manson\u2019s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was sending illegal pornography, and \u201cswatted\u201d him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.",
      "Gore reached her own agreement with Manson to dismiss the lawsuit. A message to her attorneys seeking comment wasn't immediately returned."

      "The victory for reproductive rights groups sets the stage for their next battle: challenging other laws on the books in Arizona they say are too restrictive. The 15-week cutoff, for example, allows exceptions only when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Absent a court order or legislative action, those laws will remain unchanged, even if they conflict with the voter-approved measure. Opponents of the constitutional amendment are preparing a defense.",
      "For now, providers will have discretion in performing abortions beyond 15 weeks. Legal challenges are expected within days, Attorney General Kris Mayes said at a news conference celebrating expanded access.",
      "\"The position of the state of Arizona will be that we agree that abortion is legal in our state,\" Mayes said.",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Abortion has long been an important political issue in the U.S., but it\u2019s become a defining one since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to ban or restrict access. Most Republican-controlled states have done so, and abortion rights groups have been pushing back through ballot measures. Earlier this year, Arizonans faced the possibility of living under a near-total abortion ban.",
      "Chris Love, a spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, said the constitutional amendment is the culmination of two years of hard work.",
      "\"We\u2019re so excited to see that this is finally coming to fruition,\u201d Love said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day.\u201d",
      "Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy, said the organization is anticipating legal challenges to current laws regulating abortion and is preparing to \u201cintervene where appropriate.\u201d",
      "Among those current laws is one that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before the procedure, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows. Another criminalizes abortions sought solely because of a genetic abnormality.",
      "\u201cAll the laws that have currently been on the books are under question and are subject to possible challenges at some point,\u201d said Darrell Hill, policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed earlier this month seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state currently has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4.",
      "Earlier in the day, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs contrasted Monday\u2019s statewide canvass of election results with the one four years ago, which she said was held against the backdrop of \u201craging conspiracies, attempts to stop certification across the country,\u201d leading to the Jan. 6 insurrection. She said she was grateful this time was different.",
      "Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said voters across the state cast 3,428,011 ballots in the 2024 election, up 7,446 ballots from 2020.",
      "The turnout of registered voters remained relatively unchanged, at just below 80%. Turnout was 79% for the 2020 election and 78% for the 2024 election. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

      "BOSTON -- A Massachusetts man has pleaded guilty in federal court to threatening to kill members of the state\u2019s Jewish community and bomb local synagogues.",
      "John Reardon, 59, of Millis, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty Monday to one count of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs by threat of force, one count of transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure a person, and one count of stalking using a facility of interstate commerce.",
      "\u201cThis defendant\u2019s threats to bomb synagogues and kill Jewish children stoked fear in the hearts of congregants at a time when Jews are already facing a disturbing increase in threats,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \u201cNo person and no community in this country should have to live in fear of hate-fueled violence.\"",

      "\u201cPeople of all races and faiths deserve to feel safe in their communities,\" she said.",
      "In January, Reardon called Congregation Agudas Achim in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and left a voicemail making several threats to kill congregants and bomb the synagogue, including that \u201cif you can kill the Palestinians, we can kill you,\u201d federal authorities said. Ten minutes later, he allegedly made a call to another local synagogue and a Jewish organization.",
      "Reardon was arrested days later.",

I am heartened that Mr. Reardon has apparently recognized the harm he caused and wishes to make amends.\u201d",
      "Since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel\u2019s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, there has been a sharp rise in incidents of harassment and claims of bias against both Jewish and Muslim communities.",
      "Reardon faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine up to $750,000 on the three charges. No sentencing date had been set.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican goods if the country doesn\u2019t stop the flow of drugs and migrants acros...",
      "MEXICO CITY -- President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn\u2019t stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\u201cOne tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\u201d Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "She said Tuesday that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \u201ccaravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\u201d However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \u201cis a problem of public health and consumption in your country\u2019s society.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \u201cIf a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\u201d she said.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries\u2019 deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\u201cWe negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\u201d Sheinbaum said, while adding, \u201cI think we are going to reach an agreement.\u201d",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\u201cTrump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\u201d Siller said. \u201cBut Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump\u2019s threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it\u2019s not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\u201d Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \u201cIf tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cDialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cI hope our teams can meet soon.\u201d",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \u201cuntil such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\u201d he went on, \u201cand until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- In an angry outburst in a New York courtroom, Rudy Giuliani accused a judge Tuesday of making wrong assumptions about him as he tries to comply with an order requiring him to turn over most of his assets to two election poll workers who won a libel case against him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman responded by saying he\u2019s not going to let the former New York City mayor and onetime presidential candidate blurt things out anymore in court unless he\u2019s a sworn witness.",
      "The interruption to an otherwise routine pretrial hearing in Manhattan came as the judge questioned Giuliani's lawyer about why Giuliani has not yet provided the title to a car he has relinquished in his effort to satisfy a $148 million defamation judgment won by two former Georgia election workers.",
      "\u201cYour client was the U.S. attorney for this district,\u201d the judge said, referring to Giuliani's years in the 1980s as the head of the federal prosecutor's office in the Southern District of New York, as he suggested it was hard to believe that Giuliani was incapable of getting a duplicate title to the car.",
      "Giuliani learned forward and began speaking into a microphone, telling the judge he had applied for a duplicate copy of the car's title but that it had not yet arrived.",
      "\u201cThe implication I\u2019ve been not diligent about it is totally incorrect,\u201d Giuliani said in a scolding tone. \u201cThe implication you make is against me and every implication against me is wrong.\u201d",
      "Giuliani went on: \"I\u2019m not impoverished. Everything I have is tied up. I don\u2019t have a car. I don\u2019t have a credit card. I don\u2019t have cash. I can\u2019t get to bank accounts that truly would be mine because they have put ... stop orders on, for example, my Social Security account, which they have no right to do.\u201d",
      "Liman responded by warning defense lawyers that the next time Giuliani interrupts a hearing, \u201che's not going to be permitted to speak and the court will take action.\u201d",

      "If Giuliani wants to speak in court again, he can be put on the witness stand and be sworn as a witness, Liman added.",
      "The exchange came at a hearing in which the judge refused to delay a Jan. 16 trial over the disposition of Giuliani\u2019s Florida residence and World Series rings.",
      "Those are two sets of assets that Giuliani is trying to shield from confiscation as part of Liman's order to turn over many prized possessions to the poll workers.",
      "Earlier in the proceeding, defense attorney Joseph M. Cammarata asked Liman to delay the trial, which will be heard without a jury, for a month because of Giuliani's \u201cinvolvement\" in inauguration planning for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cMy client regularly consults and deals directly with President-elect Trump on issues that are taking place as the incoming administration is afoot as well as (the) inauguration,\" Cammarata said. \"My client wants to exercise his political right to be there.\u201d",

      "Giuliani, who once served as Trump's personal attorney, was found liable last year for defaming two Georgia poll workers by falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani falsely claimed they sneaked in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines."

      "Harris' leadership team, speaking on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast that aired on Tuesday, defended strategic decisions over the campaign's closing days, some of which have faced scrutiny in the weeks since Trump's decisive victory. Specifically, they defended Harris' outreach to Republican voters, her unwillingness to distance herself from Biden, her silence on Trump's attacks on her transgender policies and her inability to schedule an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan.",
      "\u201cIn a 107-day race, it is very difficult to do all the things you would normally do in a year and a half, two years,\u201d said Harris campaign senior adviser Jen O'Malley Dillon.",
      "David Plouffe, another senior adviser, added, \u201cThere was a price to be paid for the short campaign.\"",
      "The pointed reflections on Harris' loss came just before she declared she was \u201cproud of the campaign we ran\u201d during a conference call with supporters as the party begins a painful process of self-examination. Trump won every swing state and made gains among key voting groups traditionally aligned with Democrats \u2014 young voters and voters of color, among them. Backed by the resounding win, the Republican president-elect is claiming a mandate to enact his populist agenda as he prepares to return to the White House on Jan. 20.",
      "Harris acknowledged her defeat during the conference call, but praised the political organization her team built that featured more than 408,000 volunteers who knocked on nearly 20 million doors and made over 219 million phone calls.",
      "\u201cWhat we did in 107 days was unprecedented,\u201d she said, noting that her campaign also raised more than $1.4 billion, which marks a record for U.S. presidential campaigns.",
      "Still, Harris' campaign finished the election in debt. And none of the Harris advisers acknowledged any mistakes during the wide-ranging podcast interview hosted by former Democratic operatives. Instead, they indicated that Harris had few options given the compressed timeframe and the broad anti-incumbent headwinds that have challenged elected officials across the world.",
      "They also gave Trump's team some credit.",
      "They specifically pointed to Trump's closing attack ad, which highlighted Harris' support for taxpayer-funded sex reassignment surgeries for transgender prisoners.",
      "\u201cObviously, it was a very effective ad at the end,\u201d said Harris deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks. \u201cI think that it made her seem out of touch.\u201d",
      "The campaign tested several potential response ads but, in the end, decided it was best to avoid a specific rebuttal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no easy answers to this,\u201d O'Malley Dillon said.",
      "Plouffe said he thought the Trump attack ad against \u201cBidenomics\u201d was even more effective, but he acknowledged that the transgender attacks were not helpful.",
      "\u201cShe was on tape,\" he said. \"Surgery for trans people who want to transition in prison was part of the Biden-Harris platform in 2020. It was part of what the administration did, right?\u201d",
      "And while the campaign has faced lingering questions about its media strategy, Harris' team said she actually wanted to participate in a podcast with Rogan, who is among the world's most popular podcasters and ultimately endorsed Trump.",
      "Stephanie Cutter, another Harris senior adviser, said the campaign wasn't able to \u201cfind a date\u201d to make it work.",
      "\u201cWe had discussions with Joe Rogan\u2019s team. They were great. They wanted us to come on. We wanted to come on,\u201d she said. \u201cWill she do it sometime in the future? Maybe. Who knows. But it didn\u2019t ultimately impact the outcome one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Plouffe noted that the campaign offered to do the Rogan podcast on the road in Austin, Texas. Trump ultimately did his interview with Rogan in the podcaster's studio.",
      "Harris' campaign brass also defended her decision to court moderate Republicans in the campaign's closing days. The decision has drawn ire from some progressives, who believe Harris should have worked harder to turn out more traditional Democratic voters.",
      "\u201cThis political environment sucked, OK? We were dealing with ferocious headwinds,\u201d Plouffe said. \u201cSo we had a complicated puzzle to put together here in terms of the voters.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged some \u201cdrift\u201d toward Trump among non-college-educated voters, particularly voters of color, which made Harris' outreach to moderate voters even more important.",

      "NEW YORK -- The holiday shopping season is about to reach full speed with Black Friday, which kicks off the post-Thanksgiving retail rush later this week.",
      "The annual sales event no longer creates the midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem of recent decades, in large part due to the ease of online shopping and habits forged during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Hoping to entice equivocating consumers, retailers already have spent weeks bombarding customers with ads and early offers. Still, whether visiting stores or clicking on countless emails promising huge savings, tens of millions of U.S. shoppers are expected to spend money on Black Friday itself this year.",
      "Industry forecasts estimate that 183.4 million people will shop in U.S. stores and online between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation and consumer research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics. Of that number, 131.7 million are expected to shop on Black Friday.",
      "At the same time, earlier and earlier Black Friday-like promotions, as well as the growing strength of other shopping events (hello Cyber Monday ), continue to change the holiday spending landscape.",
      "Here's what you need to know about Black Friday's history and where things stand in 2024.",
      "Black Friday falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving each year, or Nov. 29 this year.",
      "The term \u201cBlack Friday\u201d is several generations old, but it wasn't always associated with the holiday retail frenzy that we know today. The gold market crash of September 1869, for example, was notably dubbed Black Friday.",
      "The phrase's use in relation to shopping the day after Thanksgiving, however, is most often traced to Philadelphia in the mid-20th century \u2014 when police and other city workers had to deal with large crowds that congregated before the annual Army-Navy football game and to take advantage of seasonal sales.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the bus drivers and cab drivers call today 'Black Friday.' They think in terms of headaches it gives them,\u201d a Gimbels department store sales manager told The Associated Press in 1975, while watching a police officer try to control jaywalkers the day after Thanksgiving. Earlier references date back to the 1950s and 1960s.",
      "Jie Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, points to a 1951 mention of \u201cBlack Friday\u201d in a New-York based trade publication \u2014 which noted that many workers simply called in sick the day after Thanksgiving in hopes of having a long holiday weekend.",
      "Starting in the 1980s, national retailers began claiming that Black Friday represented when they went from operating in the red to in the black thanks to holiday demand. But since many retail companies now operate in the black at various times of the year, this interpretation should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say.",
      "In recent decades, Black Friday became infamous for floods of people in jam-packed stores. Endless lines of shoppers camped out at midnight in hopes of scoring deep discounts.",
      "But online shopping has made it possible to make most, if not all, holiday purchases without ever stepping foot inside a store. And while foot traffic at malls and other shopping areas has bounced back since the start of the pandemic, e-commerce isn't going away.",
      "November sales at brick and mortar stores peaked more than 20 years ago. In 2003, for example, e-commerce accounted for just 1.7% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "Unsurprisingly, online sales make up for a much bigger slice of the pie today. For last year's holiday season, e-commerce accounted for about 17.1% of all nonadjusted retail sales in the fourth quarter, Commerce Department data shows. That's up from 12.7% seen at the end of 2019.",
      "Beyond the rise of online shopping, some big ticket items that used to get shoppers in the door on the Black Friday \u2014 like a new TV \u2014 are significantly cheaper than they were decades ago, notes Jay Zagorsky, a clinical associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business.",
      "\u201cThere is less need to stand in line at midnight when the items typically associated with doorbuster sales are now much cheaper,\u201d Zagorsky told The Associated Press via email. He pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data that shows the average price for a TV has fallen 75% since 2014.",
      "While plenty of people will do most of their Black Friday shopping online, projections from the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights indicated that a majority of Black Friday shoppers (65%) still planned to shop in stores this year.",
      "It's no secret that Black Friday sales don't last just 24 hours anymore. Emails promising holiday deals now start arriving before Halloween.",
      "\u201cBlack Friday is no longer the start of the holiday shopping season. It has become the crescendo of the holiday shopping season\u201d during what now feels like \u201cBlack Friday month,\u201d Zhang said. Some retailers have updated their official marketing to refer to \u201cBlack Friday week.\u201d",
      "Retailers trying to get a head start on the competition and to manage shipping logistics helps explain the rush, Zhang said. Offering early holiday deals spreads out purchases, giving shippers more breathing room to complete orders. Zhang therefore doesn't expect the five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to cause significant strain because retailers would have taken them into account.",
      "Linking pre-Thanksgiving sales with Black Friday is also a marketing technique since it's a name consumers recognize and associate with big, limited-time bargains, Zhang said.",
      "Multiple post-Thanksgiving sales events keep shoppers enticed after Black Friday, including Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, which the National Retail Federation's online arm designated in 2005.",
      "U.S. consumers spent a record $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, and $15.7 million per minute during the day's peak sales hour, acccording to Adobe Analytics. On Black Friday, they spent $9.8 billion online, Adobe Analytics said.",
      "Enough people still enjoy shopping in person after Thanksgiving that the activity is unlikely to become extinct, Boston University's Zagorsky said.",
      "While Black Friday's significance \u201cis being slightly diminished\" over time, the shopping event is still \u201ca way to connect with others,\" he said. \"This social aspect is important and will not disappear, ensuring that Black Friday is still an important day for retailers.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 21:29:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Motor giant Stellantis says it is closing the van making plant in the context of the UK's rules on electric vehicle sales.",
    "story": [
      "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.",
      "Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.",
      "Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.",
      "There are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand.",
      "Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended.",
      "\"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\".",
      "Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\".",
      "The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",
      "It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high.",
      "However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.",
      "As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year.",
      "Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can.",
      "But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.",
      "Electric car targets could be eased as demand flags",
      "Car firms demand more help to meet 2030 petrol ban",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",
      "Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary.",
      "Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection.",
      "Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans.",
      "Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France",
      "The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation.",
      "It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton.",
      "But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\".",
      "\u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said.",
      "Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932.",
      "At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued.",
      "Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.",
      "'Major concern'",
      "Nissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\".",
      "Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs.",
      "The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable.",
      "Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up nearly one out of every four cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\".",
      "The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\".",
      "The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\"."

      "\"Having witnessed a steep rise in our helpline callers citing difficulties with online slots, GamCare further welcomes the introduction of new youth-focussed stake limits - an important step in preventing future harm,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president-elect is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam.",
    "story": [
      "Is Donald Trump serious about tariffs? This has been the question hanging over not just world markets but the whole world of economics.",
      "The popular wisdom had become that he wasn\u2019t really that serious, and the key bit of evidence for that was his nomination of hedge fund investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary, someone seen as a moderate when it came to tariffs compared with others whose names were floated for the role.",
      "The answer overnight, though, was pretty brutal. Yes, he is serious, and in the most unexpected way. By choosing to target Mexico and Canada as well as China, he is confirming threats made on the campaign trail that appeared the most fanciful.",
      "For starters he is willing to blow up the Mexico-Canada-America trade deal that he signed in his first term on day one of his second term.",
      "What does a Trump free trade deal even mean now, if the new White House is willing to put tariffs on your country anyway?",
      "And importantly, the rationale for these moves is not mainly or even much about trade or economic policy. These tariffs are about getting Mexico, Canada and China to alter their policies on crackdowns over migration and illicit drugs.",
      "Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, on topics entirely unrelated to global trade.",
      "Are the leaders of G20 nations with their own domestic audiences really going to roll over in order to give the new president a win?",
      "They could choose to wait out the inevitable impact of Trump applying a 25% increase on the cost of two-fifths of US imports on US consumers and inflation.",
      "Trump vows tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on day one",
      "Would Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "The cost of washing machines in the US rose 12% or by about $86, after Trump hit foreign-made machines with a 50% tariff during his first term. Such increases, no matter how modest, run counter to Trump's promises during the campaign to bring down the cost of living.",
      "But though Americans might be more sensitive to price rises now than they were in 2018, the political appetite for tariffs should not be underestimated.",
      "Joe Biden criticised the tariffs Trump put in place on Chinese imports during his first term. But once in office himself, President Biden left the measures in place, even expanding them in targeted ways.",
      "What is also clear is that Trump's selection of Bessent as Treasury Secretary will not temper the tariff push.",
      "Amid the battle for his nomination he went out of his way to acknowledge the power of tariffs as a tool that had been pioneered by Alexander Hamilton himself, the first ever US Treasury Secretary.",
      "But earlier this year he had also suggested that while tariffs might be used tactically, the main tool for the US rejuvenation of manufacturing would be a cheaper dollar.",
      "Europe and the UK have been spared for now. But it is important to reiterate that these moves are not even the real bulk of the tariff policy outlined by Trump.",
      "He wants to fundamentally change the global economic map, and reduce China and Europe\u2019s trade surplus with the US, which he views as \u201cripping off America\u201d.",
      "The world is far more complicated now, however, than these binary economic relationships. The US is undoubtedly powerful enough to start rebalancing world trade.",
      "Push things too far though, especially with G7 and G20 allies, and the US might find itself rather too isolated."

    "summary": "The president-elect calls it an effort to force them to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the US.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says he will hit China, Mexico and Canada with new tariffs on day one of his presidency, in an effort to force them to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the US.",
      "The US president-elect said he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, after being inaugurated on 20 January 2025.",
      "He also said \"we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" until it cracked down on fentanyl smuggling.",
      "The threat could mark a major escalation in tensions with the US's three top trading partners. It could also lead to higher prices for Americans, since tariffs work as a form of tax on imports.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer. China, Mexico and Canada account for about 40% of the $3.2tn (\u00a32.6tn) of goods it imports each year, according to official data.",
      "China has defended its efforts to stop the flow of illegal drugs, and has warned that there can be no winner in a trade war between the two.",
      "After Trump made his tariff threat, he spoke to Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for about 10 minutes, discussing trade and border security, a Canadian government official told the BBC. They had a \"good discussion\", the source said.",
      "During the call, Trudeau pointed out that the number of migrants crossing the Canadian border was much smaller compared to the US-Mexico border, the official said.",
      "Mexico's finance ministry said: \"Mexico is the United States' top trade partner, and the USMCA provides a framework of certainty for national and international investors.\"",
      "'No-one will win a trade war', says China after Trump vows to hike tariffs on day one in office",
      "Trump proves he is serious on tariffs - but it's not about trade",
      "Would Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "The measures have the potential to cause disruptions to the global supply chain and would hit the three countries targeted by the tariffs hard.",
      "The tariffs on Mexico and Canada will remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants illegally crossing the border, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,\" he wrote. \"It is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",
      "In a follow-up Truth Social post, Trump attacked Beijing for failing to follow through on promises that he said Chinese officials made to carry out the death penalty for people caught dealing fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the BBC \"the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality\".",
      "\"China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,\" he added.",
      "The Biden administration has been calling on Beijing to do more to stop the production of ingredients used in fentanyl, which Washington estimates killed almost 75,000 Americans last year.",
      "During his election campaign, Trump threatened Mexico and China with tariffs of up to 100%, if he deemed them necessary, much higher than those he put in place during his first term in office.",
      "Trump has also said he will end China's most-favoured-nation trading status with the US - the most advantageous terms Washington offers on tariffs and other restrictions.",
      "Last year, more than 80% of Mexico's exports went to the US, while around 75% of Canada's went to its southern neighbour.",
      "Even after years of a bitter trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, the US still accounts for about 15% of China's exports.",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "A tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import. So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "He has previously claimed that these taxes are \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\".",
      "This is almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Trump imposed a number of tariffs in his first term of office, many of which have been kept in place by his successor, President Joe Biden. Economic studies suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Trump's \"additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" earmarked for China were on top of the 25% he was planning for Canada and Mexico.",
      "What is Trump's strategy?",
      "The move is \"clearly consistent with his promise that he made during the campaign to utilise tariffs as a weapon to accomplish many of his policy initiatives,\" Stephen Roach, Senior Fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center of Yale Law School, told the BBC's Business Today programme.",
      "Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has previously suggested that the president-elect's threats to impose major tariff hikes were part of his negotiating strategy.",
      "\u201cMy general view is that at the end of the day, he's a free trader,\" Bessent said of Trump in an interview with the Financial Times before he was nominated for the role.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s escalate to de-escalate.\u201d",
      "It comes as the Chinese economy is in a significantly more vulnerable position than it was during the previous Trump presidency.",
      "The country has been struggling with a number of serious issues, including an ongoing property market crisis, weak domestic demand and growing local government debt.",
      "The new tariffs appear to break the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade.",
      "The deal, which Trump signed into law, took effect in 2020. It continued a largely duty-free trading relationship between the three neighbouring countries.",
      "Outside the official reaction from the three countries affected, the response has been critical.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of the Canadian province of Ontario, said Trump's planned tariff would be \"devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the US\".",

      "For years, politicians have said they planned to address this issue. Then, last week, the current government committed to abolishing leasehold. Housing minister Matthew Pennycook said in a statement that there will be a consultation and white paper early next year - but for some this has come too late.",
      "And the question that remains is, how did it reach a point where the government needed to intervene?",
      "Part of the problem is that this is an archaic system, based on principles dating back to the feudal days of landowners and tenants. Under the current system, leaseholders have to pay charges to a freeholder for services, including the maintenance and repair of communal areas and buildings insurance. Often a managing agent is appointed by the freeholder.",
      "The vague language in the current law adds to the confusion. The law simply states that service charges must be \u201creasonable\u201d and that where costs relate to work or services, they must be of a \u201creasonable\u201d standard.",
      "But campaigners in the field argue that there is another issue at play. They claim unscrupulous freeholders and managing agents are exploiting the system.",
      "\u201cExploitation in broad daylight\u201d",
      "As Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, chief executive of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, puts it: investors cottoned on to the fact they could make money out of the boom in newbuild apartment blocks that have sprung up across the country over the last 25 years.",
      "Previously most freeholders were local authorities or landowners but the boom has led to investors - including venture capital, pension funds and even charities - getting involved. Income from ground rents and lease extensions as well as the rising value of the land itself all make this lucrative.",
      "\u201cWe're talking about a multi-billion pound property sector.\u201d He argues that leaseholders are at the mercy of companies who are \u201cjust there to make money out of them\u201d.",
      "In a recent investigation, the BBC examined about 140 tribunals relating to one London-based firm, Assethold, and discovered that judges have assessed it to have overcharged homeowners by a combined sum of nearly \u00a31.2m. Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",
      "But the BBC has seen complaints about other companies accused of overcharging leaseholders too. The problem with policing this is that anyone can buy a freehold and anyone can set themselves up as a managing agent.",
      "\u201cThere are still thousands of people being exploited,\u201d says Sir Peter Bottomley, former Father of the House of Commons and a campaigner against the leasehold system. \u201cThe stories that have come to me in my last 15, 20 years in Parliament would make most people weep.\u201d He says that these include numerous stories of leaseholders being exploited by freeholders.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been happening in broad daylight.\u201d",
      "He also argues that it is \u201coften the young and less well-off who are being lumbered with costs they cannot afford, in ways which are unjustified\u201d.",
      "The Residential Freehold Association (RFA), which represents the largest freeholders in the country, strongly disagrees that the system is \u201cexploitative\u201d, but says it has \u201ccalled for improvements to the home buying and selling process\u201d so that leaseholders understand their obligations.",
      "Questions around transparency",
      "Large newbuild estates and buildings can be complex and expensive to maintain, but a concern among some is the lack of transparency. Leaseholders have complained about hefty bills with little detail or unexplained demands for eye-wateringly high sums.",
      "The Leasehold Advisory Service says that of the 33,000 people have gone to them for advice in the past five years, it has received more complaints about service charges than any other subject.",
      "However, industry insiders argue that there are legitimate reasons for rising charges, including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the fallout from Brexit.",
      "\u201cWe have seen significant inflation in recent years, as well as extensive material cost increases following the Covid pandemic. This ultimately translates into higher service charges,\u201d the RFA said in a statement.",
      "Jaclyn Mangaroo of the Property Institute, a professional body that represents managing agents in England and Wales, is among those arguing that Brexit triggered an increase in costs. Some say exiting the EU has led to labour shortages in the industry.",
      "Mrs Mangaroo also points out that the Grenfell fire tragedy has seen insurance charges rise, which in turn pushed up service charges.",
      "However her organisation wants managing agents to be regulated to prevent what she calls \u201cabuse\u201d of the system. Its members are properly trained, she stresses, \u201cbut there is no oversight or accountability for those outside the membership, for everybody else that's operating\u201d.",
      "Last week the housing minister has announced they would regulate managing agents but added they need to consult on this first.",
      "Labour's new plans",
      "Abolishing leasehold for flats was not included in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024. Ultimately, the Conservative government ran out of time to get everything it wanted into the legislation before Rishi Sunak called the general election.",
      "The legislation that passed did include some gains for leaseholders, such as giving them more power to buy their freehold. Now, however, certain elements of the previous government\u2019s plans that never made into law will be taken forward by Labour, including making it easier for residents to acquire \u201cthe right to manage\u201d. (In other words, they will still have a freeholder but can take over the management of their building.)",
      "However, the RFA says its studies show that \u201cself-management looks to make no difference\u201d to service charge costs.",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "After Scotland abolished leasehold two decades ago, it introduced the commonhold system where residents own the building and a factor (a type of property agent) maintains the common areas of buildings on their behalf. Unlike managing agents in England, factors must be registered.",
      "Commonhold has been an option in England and Wales since it was introduced under Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2002, but the tenure has not caught on - it applies in only 1% of properties in England and Wales.",
      "Then, last week, Pennycook announced that commonhold would be made \"the default tenure,\" as part of the wider plan to abolish leasehold, but this will all take time to get right. The prime minister reiterated this in a radio interview.",
      "Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), believes that commonhold is the right way forward. \u201c[It means] the flat owners all have a vested interest in getting best value for money on service charges.\u201d",
      "But the RFA warns that commonhold isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. Sometimes, not all residents in a building agree to work going ahead, which can slow down repairs or prevent them happening at all, they say.",
      "Fightback from landowners",
      "Whatever happens next, it won\u2019t be easy. Landowners have power and deep pockets and they\u2019re prepared to fight for the land. A group of major freeholders are bringing a legal challenge under the Human Rights Act over proposed changes to the calculation used to compensate landowners when leases are extended.",
      "Henry Hill of the ConservativeHome website is sceptical that any government will ever be able to successfully take on all those with a vested interest in preserving leasehold. \u201cWe're talking tens of billions, hundreds of billions maybe worth of value, unless the government was prepared to try and just take that without compensation, which in our current legal regime would be impossible,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cFormally abolishing leasehold is not going to happen.\u201c",
      "However, Sebastian O\u2019Kelly is hopeful. \u201cLabour needs to get it finished,\u201d he says.",
      "Labour has said it will indeed get it finished and it is \u201cswitching on\u201d some of the legislation that the Conservatives bought in. In addition, they are drafting another bill that will go further.",
      "In the meantime, however, frustration is still growing among many leaseholders, as this all requires more waiting.",
      "And according to Suzanne Muna from the Social Housing Action Campaign (SHAC), \u201cpeople are getting organised\u201d, with members going on service charge strike and refusing to pay soaring bills. It is a risky move, as under lease conditions, it can leave leaseholders at risk of losing their home.",
      "Some, however, have successfully challenged their service charges. Property lawyer Keeley Livingstone, from Essex, says she was able to save \u00a3140,000 for her and her neighbours, after spending more than 100 hours examining their bills and pointing to the freeholder where they had been overcharged.",
      "\u201cThere were a few things on there that just didn't look right,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a concierge and security. I questioned that because [the bill] was so high, and we don't see half of these people. That was removed - \u00a398,000 worth.\u201d",
      "But others, like Michele, still feel stuck. \u201cI have absolutely no power,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to sell my flat and I cannot.\u201d",
      "She says that Pennycook, who is her local MP, seemed sympathetic to her situation when she and her neighbours raised it with him. Whether he can change their particular situation - and that of thousands of others - remains to be seen.",
      "\u201cI would never buy a leasehold again,\u201d says Michele. \u201cLandlords have too much power. The management company has too much power. It should be equal, and it's not.\u201d",

    "summary": "The government says charging for hand luggage and printing boarding passes at the airport are \"abusive practices\".",
    "story": [
      "Spain has fined five budget airlines a total of \u20ac179m (\u00a3149m) for \"abusive practices\" including charging for hand luggage.",
      "Ryanair has been given the largest fine of \u20ac108m (\u00a390m), while EasyJet has received a penalty of \u20ac29m (\u00a324m).",
      "Vueling, Norwegian and Volotea were issued with sanctions by Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry on Friday.",
      "The ministry said it plans to ban practices such as charging extra for carry-on hand luggage and reserving seats for children.",
      "The fines are the biggest sanction issued by the ministry, and follow an investigation into the budget airline industry.",
      "The ministry said it had upheld fines that were first announced in May after dismissing appeals lodged by the companies.",
      "Vueling, the budget arm of British Airways owner IAG, has been fined \u20ac39m (\u00a332m), while Norwegian Airlines and Volotea have been fined \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.3m) and \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) respectively.",
      "The fines were issued because the airlines were found to have provided misleading information and were not transparent with prices, \"which hinders consumers' ability to compare offers\" and make informed decisions, the ministry said.",
      "Ryanair was accused of violating a range of consumer rights, including charging for larger carry-on luggage, seat selection, and asking for \"a disproportionate amount\" to print boarding passes at terminals.",
      "Each fine was calculated based on the \"illicit profit\" obtained by each airline from these practices.",
      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the fines were \"illegal\" and \"baseless\", adding that he will appeal the case and take it to the EU courts.",
      "\"Ryanair has for many years used bag fees and airport check-in fees to change passenger behaviour and we pass on these cost savings in the form of lower fares to consumers,\" he said.",
      "Easyjet and Norwegian said they would also appeal the decision.",

      "But Andr\u00e9s Barrag\u00e1n, secretary general for consumer affairs and gambling at the ministry, defended the fines, saying the government's decision was based on Spanish and EU law.",
      "\"It is an abuse to charge \u20ac20 for just printing the boarding card in the airport, [it's] something no one wants,\" he told the BBC's World Business Report programme.",

    "summary": "Scientists in the Caribbean are turning algae that have been choking beaches into biofuel.",
    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",
      "UWI hopes to introduce other sargassum-based innovations too, such as pest control products.",
      "Ms Spencer says it\u2019s been \"heart-warming\u201d to witness the results of the team\u2019s research.",
      "\u201cJust seeing the actual potential is motivating me to keep working,\u201d she adds.",
      "As for Brittney, five years after her eureka moment, she says she\u2019s still \u201cpinching\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cTo see the car in action was mind-blowing,\u201d she grins. \u201cI would encourage all young scientists to press ahead with their ideas. You never know when you might make the next big discovery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of work, plenty of grit and pushing against walls to reach this point,\u201d Dr Henry concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of UWI innovation and is exportable to the wider world, because it\u2019s not just the Caribbean that\u2019s affected; sargassum also impacts parts of West Africa, South America and Florida.",

    "summary": "The iconic carmaker's rebrand has certainly caught people's attention, but will it pay off?",
    "story": [
      "Jaguar has urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the carmaker.",
      "The company, embarking on the biggest change in its 102-year old history, released a new logo and a so-called \"social media tease\" this week, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in early December.",
      "The teaser video has faced backlash, with many critics pointing to the fact it doesn't feature an actual car. Others have praised the company for being bold and shaking things up.",
      "Either way, the rebrand has grabbed people's attention and Jaguar has since admitted it not only expected such debate - but it wanted it.",
      "In the 1960s, Jaguar launched the E-Type and XJ which have come to be known among some of the most iconic cars of all time.",
      "Now the company is trying to do the same again by unveiling its new \"design vision\" in Miami next month.",
      "Teasing the vision online, the 30 second advert features models in extravagant, brightly-coloured outfits who reveal the new company logo written as JaGUar.",
      "No cars, no suave men in suits, no big cats.",
      "\"Do you sell cars?\" was the response on X, from owner Elon Musk, who is also the boss of electric car firm Tesla.",
      "\"This is surely a joke?\" added one user, while another suggested the move would \"cost jobs and do real damage\". Some said \"Go woke, go broke\".",
      "Specsavers, known for its humorous social media manner, created a mock-up of its own logo in response, which looked like it had been created on Microsoft Paint.",
      "While supermarket Aldi chipped in at Jaguar's \"Copy Nothing\" slogan with: \"You sound like our legal team.\"",
      "Amid the anger and sarcasm, Jaguar has doubled down on its decision, replying to some posts with phrases such as \"To live is to evolve\".",
      "\"We had to break rules and do something that would get us cut thru,\" a spokesman told the BBC - suggesting this is all part of the plan.",
      "As Martin Brundle, the former Formula 1 racing driver turned broadcaster, put it:  \"I have no idea what this is all about, but it\u2019s genius.",
      "\"Everyone is talking about Jaguar in a moment of time when they\u2019re not actually making cars.\"",
      "'Maybe Jaguar wanted this response'",
      "Lee Rolston is the chief growth officer of global branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and has worked on rebrands of household names such as Burger King and the RSPCA.",
      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response,\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "story": [
      "The 40th anniversary remake of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? has been unveiled, amid renewed discussion about the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "The new \"ultimate mix\" blends vocals from several versions of the charity single that have been recorded over the years, so that George Michael duets with Harry Styles, and Chris Martin harmonises with the Sugababes.",
      "However, Ed Sheeran has objected to his vocals being recycled for the new track because the \"narrative\" had changed, and said he would have declined permission if he had been asked.",
      "In response, Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley, who sang on the original 1984 single, told BBC Radio 2: \"I think they [critics like Sheeran] should shut up, to be honest.\"",
      "Hadley added: \"If you take that route, then nobody does anything to help anybody. So it's just nonsense...",
      "\"Everybody's doing their bit to try and support various charities and we were doing our bit, innocently, to support what was happening in Ethiopia... So what do we do? Do we sit back and do nothing?\"",
      "Explaining his position last week, Sheeran shared a post by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who argued the song perpetuates \"damaging stereotypes\" that Africa is plagued by \"famine and poverty\", which can only be remedied by Western assistance.",
      "Midge Ure, who co-wrote the track, said it was \"unfortunate\" that Sheeran had not been approached, and acknowledged the criticisms of Band Aid's approach.",
      "\"I understand the whole thing about the 'white saviour complex',\" he told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine. \"It's not new. We've had this thrown at us for 40 years.\"",
      "However, he said the song was not about portraying Africa in a negative light, but was trying to show the real-life consequences \"of famine, of war, of conflict\".",
      "\"And the result is children who need food, who need medication, who need education, and that's what we deal with.\"",
      "Trevor Horn, who produced the new version, said he would have removed Sheeran's vocals if he'd known about the objection. Live Aid promoter Harvey Goldsmith, who was also on Vine's show, remarked: \"Stuff him.\"",
      "Liam Payne's vocals remain",
      "The original mix of Do They Know It's Christmas? raised \u00a38m for famine relief in 12 months, while the Band Aid Charitable Trust has raised almost \u00a3150m to date.",
      "The remix was released on Monday, exactly 40 years after the first recording took place at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, west London.",
      "In the studio, Horn used the same machine learning technology that The Beatles employed on last year's Now And Then to extricate vocals from three different recordings of the song.",

      "It also includes a sample of Michael Buerk's harrowing 1984 BBC News report from Korem in Ethiopia, which inspired Sir Bob Geldof to create the song.",
      "The new version ends with David Bowie, who couldn't make it to Notting Hill in 1984, delivering a spoken introduction to the original version: \"It would be wonderful if you could all buy copies of this record.\"",
      "Premiering the song on BBC Radio 2, Geldof became emotional as he remembered some of the stars involved, including Bowie and George Michael, who are no longer with us.",
      "The musician also said he had been moved by late One Direction star Liam Payne's contribution to the 2014 version.",
      "\"I just thought, 'Well, he's here? He's here [on the record] with his mates. He's alive with us.'\"",
      "Piles on the schmaltz",
      "The new version opens without the sepulchral bells and pounding drums that introduced the original. Instead, the voices of Paul Young, Bono and Sheeran deliver the first lines over a haunting new string arrangement - including some vocal takes that have never been heard before.",
      "Throughout, Horn shovels on the schmaltz. The new mix is stuffed with harp glissandos and twinkly Christmas motifs. And he draws out the lyrics for maximum emotional impact - repeating key phrases and adding a ghostly echo to the first appearance of the \"feed the world\" chorus.",
      "The song's most controversial and insensitive lyric, \"Tonight thank God it's them instead of you\", remains intact - but is immediately followed by the 2014 rewrite, \"Tonight we\u2019re reaching out and touching you.\"",
      "Tugs at the heartstrings",
      "There's room for everyone - Thom Yorke's piano from Band Aid 20 is mixed with the bass playing of Duran Duran's John Taylor two decades earlier; while Dizzee Rascal's wholly unnecessary rap from the 2004 version somehow remains in the mix.",
      "(The 1989 recording, however, appears to have been erased from existence: There's no sign of Kylie Minogue, Lisa Stansfield or Sonia's contributions.)",
      "The end result is totally overblown, smothering the stripped-back earnestness of the original.",
      "And yet, it still tugs at the heartstrings. There's something about the chorus Sir Bob and Midge Ure wrote in 1984 that captures a spirit of hope in humanity that no amount of production trickery can erase.",
      "On Radio 2, Sir Bob reminded listeners that the project was about more than the song.",
      "Every copy sold or streamed \"connects directly to that meal and that child, or that broken woman or that farmer who just can't grow something because of climate change, drought or flooding or whatever\", he said.",
      "\"That's what we do daily. And I wake up to 12 of those emails every single day for the last 40 years, but we've been able to deal with it because of you.\"",
      "However, there has been a growing chorus of disapproval around the Band Aid project, with critics highlighting the song's patronising portrayal of Africa as a barren land that needed rescuing by Western intervention.",
      "Ethiopia's prime minister Abiy Ahmed said that while the 80s original was \"well-meaning at the time\", it was \"frustrating to see our nation\u2019s ancient history, culture, diversity and beauty reduced to doom and gloom\".",
      "Speaking to The Times, he said Band Aid's \"humanitarian commitment is admirable and to be appreciated\" but that \"a good cause that has not evolved with the times might end up doing more harm than good\".",
      "Sir Bob responded to the criticism over the weekend.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept millions of people alive,\" he said. \"Why would Band Aid scrap feeding thousands of children dependent on us for a meal?",
      "\"Why not keep doing that? Because of an abstract wealthy-world argument, regardless of its legitimacy? No abstract theory regardless of how sincerely held should impede or distract from that hideous, concrete real-world reality.",
      "\"There are 600 million hungry people in the world - 300 million are in Africa. We wish it were other but it is not. We can help some of them. That\u2019s what we will continue to do.\"",

      "Charlie Redmayne, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins, said: \"Barbara Taylor Bradford was a truly exceptional writer whose first book, the international bestseller A Woman of Substance, changed the lives of so many who read it - and still does to this day.\"",
      "She was \"a natural storyteller\" as well as \"a great, great friend\", he added.",
      "A Woman of Substance was the rags-to-riches tale of Emma Harte, a young woman who goes from a being a maid to building and running a major department store.",
      "The mini-series was watched by almost 14 million people on Channel 4 in 1985 and was nominated for two Emmy Awards.",
      "Emma was played by Jenny Seagrove, who paid tribute to the author as a \"dear friend\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Seagrove recalled being a young and nervous actress when she first met Taylor Bradford.",
      "\"I met Barbara at a screening [of A Woman of Substance] and she just walked up to me and she hugged me and said: 'Oh, you are my Emma.'",
      "\"That was all I needed. I burst into tears.\"",
      "She added that the book was semi-autobiographical and \"you could feel the truth in it\".",
      "'Changed women's lives'",
      "Taylor Bradford had a huge impact on women, Seagrove said.",
      "\"We'd go on publicity tours... and women would come up to me randomly... and say 'You changed my life' because Emma Harte had changed their life in some way, [like] to start a business. It literally changed women's lives.\"",
      "The actress said she went to the US for Taylor Bradford's 90th birthday celebrations last year.",
      "\"Even though she was ill, she put on her finery and was piped in by a bagpiper. She just never changed. She was always curious, always kind, always championing women and always giving and sharing.",
      "\"She championed women before it was fashionable, and that's a great legacy,\" Seagrove added.",
      "A statement from Taylor Bradford's representative on Monday said she \"died peacefully at her home yesterday (24 November 2024) following a short illness, and was surrounded by loved ones to the very end\".",
      "Taylor Bradford was born in Leeds, where her mother \"force-fed me books\" and she was in the same primary school class as Alan Bennett.",
      "Young Barbara had her first story published at the age of 10 in a children\u2019s magazine, and left school at 15 to work as a typist and copytaker on the Yorkshire Evening Post.",
      "She got her first stories into the newspaper\u2019s pages by surreptitiously slipping them into the sub-editor\u2019s tray. It took the editors some time to realise what she was doing, but they then promoted her to be a journalist, and she was the paper\u2019s only female reporter at the time.",
      "She went on to write an interior decoration column that was syndicated to 183 newspapers, and her first books were about home design.",
      "They included the Complete Encyclopedia of Homemaking Ideas in 1968, and she also wrote a string of entries in the How to be the Perfect Wife series.",
      "Her first foray into fiction, when she was in her mid-40s, brought huge success and broke the mould.",
      "\"When I wrote A Woman of Substance I didn't sit down and think, I'm going to write about a woman warrior who conquers the world and smashes the glass ceiling, but I did want to write about women in a positive way,\" she told the Guardian in 2017.",
      "\"At the time there were a lot of very sexy books out there but the women didn't come out of them very well.\"",
      "Her other novels included the Ravenscar trilogy, about a 20th Century dynasty that finished with 25-year-old Elizabeth, loosely based on Elizabeth I, at the head of a business empire.",
      "The four-book Cavendon series follows two families - one aristocratic, the other their servants - from the 1920s to the 40s.",
      "'Borrowing from myself'",
      "Standalone novels included A Sudden Change of Heart, The Women in His Life and A Secret Affair.",
      "Her most recent novel, The Wonder of it All, was published last year.",
      "\"I think people understand now, I write about women warriors - women who go out and conquer the world, who are not going to be dependent on anybody,\" the author told BBC Radio 3's Private Passions in 2022.",
      "\"They're going to have a career, and they're going to be successful, and they're driven and ambitious and disciplined and determined.",
      "\"And I guess I keep borrowing from myself because that's the way I'm made.\"",
      "A number of her books were turned into TV or film versions. A Woman of Substance starred Liam Neeson opposite Seagrove, while Elizabeth Hurley appeared in 1989's Act of Will, and Anthony Hopkins was in 1991's To Be The Best.",
      "The screen versions were made by the author's husband, Hollywood producer Robert Bradford.",
      "They married on Christmas Eve in 1963, after which she moved to the US. He died in 2019.",
      "Taylor Bradford's spokeswoman said she would be buried alongside her late husband in New York.",
      "Taylor Bradford was made an OBE for services to literature by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and was also an ambassador for the National Literacy Trust.",
      "In its tribute, the charity hailed her as \"a passionate advocate for improving literacy skills throughout her life\", and said she \"helped change lives in some of the UK's most disadvantaged communities\".",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 23:33:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Ever since two young men were jailed for killing their wealthy parents in 1989, the case has gripped the US.",
    "story": [
      "After spending more than 30 years behind bars for killing their parents, Lyle and Erik Menendez have a hope at being released from prison.",
      "The 1989 murder case, which has gripped the US for decades, burst into life again this autumn when Los Angeles's top prosecutor backed the brothers' bid for resentencing.",
      "The move could allow for their immediate release - if approved by a judge and a parole board.",
      "But their path to freedom will face a few hurdles.",
      "The brothers teleconferenced into a court hearing on Monday as several relatives testified in support of their release. During the hearing, a judge postponed taking up their resentencing bid until 30 January.",
      "Here we break down what's happening as they seek their freedom.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Jose and Kitty Menendez were found dead inside their Beverly Hills mansion after being shot 13 times in August 1989.",
      "Their sons - Erik and Lyle - called police, telling authorities they had got home and found their parents dead.",
      "Police initially thought it was a mob hit but lavish spending and partying shifted the focus on to the brothers.",
      "A confession to their psychologist was their undoing. The doctor\u2019s girlfriend secretly recorded their confession and reported it to authorities.",
      "Who are the Menendez family?",
      "Who are the Menendez family?",
      "In March 1990, the brothers were charged by police. They went to trial in 1993 and the brothers admitted to the killings but argued they acted out of self-defence.",
      "They outlined years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse - namely by their father, Jose, a music and film executive in Hollywood.",
      "Lyle and Erik testified that they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative and that they believed their parents were planning to kill them.",
      "Family members testified about abuse they witnessed but none said they saw sexual abuse firsthand.",
      "Prosecutors argued their motive was a $14m (\u00a310.8m) inheritance.",
      "Their first trial ended with a mistrial, but a second trial in 1995 led to them to being convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "Who wants the Menendez brothers released?",
      "Fast forward nearly three decades, and public interest has been renewed, after a successful Netflix drama and docuseries.",
      "More than two dozen members of the Menendez family, and celebrities such as  Kim Kardashian, say Erik and Lyle, now aged 53 and 56, should be released.",
      "On Monday, several family members appeared in court for a status hearing in the case.",
      "Kitty Menendez's sister, Joan Anderson VanderMolen, testified in court Monday and pleaded for the judge to allow their release.",
      "\"I want them to come home,\" the 92-year-old said, using a walker to reach the front of the courtroom. \"No child should have to endure what Erik and Lyle lived through.\"",
      "Jose Menendez\u2019s sister, Terry Beralt, 85, also testified in support of their release. \"Thirty-five years is a long time,\" she said, having to pause several times as she teared up.",
      "She said she wanted the opportunity to see and hug them - without going to a prison to do so.",
      "But the family is not  in total agreement.",
      "A lawyer for Kitty Menendez\u2019s brother, Milton Andersen, called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and said their \"actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades\".",
      "Mr Andersen believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\", according to his lawyer, Kathy Cady.",
      "Resentencing could lead to release",
      "Current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n agreed to reexamine the case, and in late October, he recommended the brothers be resentenced to a lower penalty that would make them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "He pointed to the brothers' rehabilitation efforts in prison - their educational accomplishments and contributions to the community.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n also noted that with today\u2019s deeper understanding of the impact of sexual and physical abuse on children, the trial would be approached differently.",
      "But critics of Gasc\u00f3n say he only got involved to help his poll numbers running for re-election.",
      "He lost and the new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, has promised to be tougher on crime.",
      "He takes office on 2 December, and a crucial hearing to examine the Menendez brothers' potential resentencing was originally scheduled days later on 11 December.",
      "That has now been postponed until 30 January. The judge is expected to hear from a variety of witnesses in the case and examine what happened during the original trials and the prison records of both Erik and Lyle.",
      "Hochman said the delay helps \"provide me with sufficient time to review the extensive prison records, transcripts of two lengthy trials and voluminous exhibits, as well as consult with prosecutors, law enforcement, defense counsel and victim family members\".",
      "He has not made a decision on whether to back the resentencing effort but said he would review \"all the facts and the law to reach a fair and just decision, and then defend it in court\".",
      "If the judge ultimately approves their resentencing, the case would move forward to a parole board.",
      "The panel will read their psychological evaluations, review letters from investigating officers, and hear testimony from surviving family members.",
      "Other routes to freedom?",
      "If their bid for resentencing fails, they are pursuing other avenues that could lead to their release, including:",
      "Clemency: the Menendez brothers\u2019 defence attorney Mark Geragos filed a clemency request with Governor Gavin Newsom, opening a second potential path to freedom.",
      "Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother\u2019s convictions.",
      "But the governor has said any decision he makes will be based on what newly-elected district attorney determines after reviewing the case in full.",
      "Habeas Corpus: The Menendez brothers\u2019 last path to freedom hinges on a habeas corpus petition filed last year, which seeks review of new evidence that was not presented at the trial.",
      "It claims their convictions and prison sentences are unconstitutional in light of, what they allege, is newly uncovered evidence that the brothers were the victims of childhood sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez.",
      "This includes an allegation of rape from a former member of Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3.",
      "Another piece of evidence is a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin eight months before the murders detailing alleged abuse.",
      "Using the new evidence, the petition seeks to vacate their first-degree murder convictions in pursuit of a lesser charge such as manslaughter, which could result in an early release from prison.",
      "Their life in prison",
      "Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.",
      "Lyle Menendez married twice. His first marriage, to former model Anna Eriksson in 1996, ended in divorce after she reportedly discovered he was corresponding with other women.",
      "In 2003, he married Rebecca Sneed, a magazine editor, in a prison ceremony. Sneed has largely avoided the spotlight but has been described as a supportive and private partner.",
      "Erik Menendez married Tammi Saccoman in 1999, following a pen-pal relationship that blossomed into a romance. Tammi, who had previously been married, has been outspoken about her commitment to Erik.",
      "In 2005, she published a memoir titled They Said We'd Never Make It, detailing their relationship. Despite the challenges of marrying a man behind bars, Tammi has referred to their marriage as fulfilling, calling it a unique but strong partnership.",

      "In the UK and Ireland, the film is forecast to earn $17.6m (\u00a314m) this weekend, making it the top-grossing opening weekend of 2024.",
      "In North America, where Gladiator II also opened on Friday, this was the strongest weekend at the box office before the Thanksgiving holiday since 2013, the Boxoffice Company said.",
      "The musical Wicked, based on a book inventing the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, premiered on Broadway in 2003 and has been running on the West End for two decades.",
      "In North America, the film adaptation raked in $46.48m (\u00a337m) on Friday (the data also includes Thursday premieres), and $36m on Saturday.",

      "It made $11.4m (\u00a39m) on its first weekend, then dropped to $6m (\u00a34.8m) this weekend, a \"fairly strong performance\", Mr Loria said.",
      "Together with Paddington In Peru, which earned \u00a39.7m on its opening weekend on 8 November, it\u2019s \u201cone of the most exciting box offices times in the UK post-pandemic with those three titles\", he said.",

      "The title of Barbara Taylor Bradford's most celebrated, and first, novel A Woman of Substance could well have been used to describe the author herself.",
      "The 1979 story of a young woman's journey from rags to riches went from bestseller to super-seller in a year and stayed on the New York Times list for 43 weeks.",
      "Bradford wrote more than 30 further books - again, all bestsellers - amounting to more than 90 million copies bought worldwide and netting her a fortune of more than \u00a3100m.",
      "Although she also wrote about male protagonists, Bradford's speciality was capturing the essence of what it meant to be a strong, determined woman fighting against the odds to succeed.",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Her stories were dense and epic  - often period family sagas which ran into a book series - full of drama, passion and humanity which consequently made rich material for adaptation.",
      "Several of her novels were turned into TV films or miniseries, many produced by her adored and adoring husband of 55 years, Robert \"the General\" Bradford.",
      "Remarkably, given how prolific she was, Bradford always wrote in long-hand or on an electric typewriter and claimed almost never to have writer's block.",
      "She worked long, dogged hours and described herself to the Guardian as \"stoical and strong\" and with a \"backbone of steel,\" like her heroines.",
      "She added: \"They're all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I've written about myself in every book.\"",
      "Bradford was born in 1933 in a suburb of Leeds and was an only child (her older brother died before she was born) doted on by her mother and father, who was an engineer.",
      "Although the family wasn't wealthy, the young Barbara was pampered and always impeccably turned out. \"I always had a new Whitsuntide bonnet and patent shoes and little white socks,\" she recalled in 2006.",
      "And looking good became very much part of Bradford's larger-than-life adult persona, which was unerringly draped in designer elegance and expensive jewellery. She also developed a keen eye for priceless art.",
      "As for her formation, her mother had high hopes. She encouraged her to read classic literature, such as Dickens and the Brontes, and sent her to private school.",
      "Bradford later fictionalised her parents' marriage in her novel Act of Will. It was dedicated to her mother, who she said \"gave me the greatest gift a mother can give a child, the desire to excel\".",
      "A 2005 biography of Bradford suggested she was indeed descended from lofty stock by way of her mother, who was, it said, the illegitimate daughter of a marquis. Bradford was initially furious at the story, but with time said she'd \"come round\".",
      "Bradford's own writing aspirations began at the age of 10, when her proud mother sent a story her daughter had written to a magazine, and - after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it - she was hooked.",
      "At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but was soon taken on as a reporter.",
      "\"It was because I was such a bad typist and was ruining so much of their expensive paper!\" she joked. Nevertheless, at 18 she became the newspaper's Woman's Page editor.",
      "By the age of 20, she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \"I was very, very driven from the age of 10. That's what I wanted to be - a reporter,\" she recalled in 2019.",
      "The year 1961 turned out to be significant for Bradford after she was roped into a blind date.",
      "The unknown beau was the rich and successful film producer Robert Bradford. He was \"movie-star gorgeous,\" and it was pretty much love at first sight, she recalled. Two years later they were married and living in New York.",
      "She continued her career in journalism, including covering interior design and lifestyles, before trying her hand at children's and decorating books. But her childhood desire to write grown-up fiction was still bubbling under the surface.",
      "After several failed attempts at suspense novels, Bradford stopped and took stock.",
      "\"I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I've never written a novel? I'm going to hate myself. I'm going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers,\" she said in her 2006 Guardian interview.",
      "That's when she embarked on the saga-driven journey that made her name, fortune and shaped her life, selling A Woman of Substance to a publisher on the strength of a 10-page outline and 192 pages.",
      "A Woman of Substance took her two years to write, with the original manuscript running to 1,520 pages. It told the story of Emma Harte, the kitchen maid of a wealthy Yorkshire family, who, through grit and fierce ambition, became the boss of a huge retail empire.",
      "Harte was ruthless but also warm-hearted and fair and readers loved her, making the novel a global best-seller. Realising she'd struck gold, Bradford went on produce six further Emma Harte novels, charting her growth and the lives of her children.",
      "Talking about the story's appeal, Bradford said it had \"everything in it\u2026 drama, intrigue, money, passion, power and revenge - all of those great human emotions that make for a good story\".",
      "\"Woman all over the world told me that Emma Harte was their true role model, and that the book had changed their lives for the better.",
      "\"I had set out to simply tell a good story about a strong woman. I hadn't intended to send a message. But apparently, quite unconsciously I had.",
      "\"All I know is that I wrote the kind of story I love to tell about an ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary in living her life a certain way and goes out to conquer the world.\"",
      "A Woman of Substance was the first of her books to be adapted for TV. It became an Emmy Award-nominated series in 1985, starring Jenny Seagrove, Deborah Kerr and Liam Neeson.",
      "Two other books from the series were also made for TV, Hold the Dream and To Be the Best.",
      "Bradford revelled in her craft, writing at great lengths with novels often stretching to more than 500 pages.",
      "She wrote multiple stand-alone works yet, with often more ideas about her protagonists and their families than would fit into one book, Bradford produced further series, including The Ravenscar trilogy, The Clarendon Chronicles and The House of Falconer.",
      "The Ravenscar Dynasty (one of a trilogy), is set in Edwardian England, and told through the eyes of its handsome, kind but driven hero, Edward Deravenel, who is locked in a vicious battle for the family business.",
      "\"It's very dramatic and it's actually a retelling of the Wars of the Roses, but in modern times. I just took the life of Edward IV and told it in modern terms,\" Bradford explained to the Daily Express, adding she researched how to kill people with poisons, \"so there's quite a lot of deaths.\"",
      "And though the main character is male, the stories also unfailingly follow Bradford's formula of depicting strong, memorable women within the cast, along with another Bradford ingredient - passion.",
      "\"Women always say to me, 'Don't stop writing those nice sex scenes.' But, really, I'm more interested in the protagonist's character,\" Bradford told the Telegraph.",
      "\"So, either she's going to be a wimp, and do nothing, or she's going to be driven and ambitious. Character is what drives everything forward.\"",
      "Accordingly, many of Bradford's novels had motivational titles such as To Be The Best, Everything to Gain and Her Own Rules.",
      "Robert Bradford played a large role in his wife's work and, she said, shepherded her career.  In addition to making screen versions of his wife's stories, he liked to be involved in their promotion.",
      "He was the first person to buy a full-page ad on the back page of the New York Times Arts section.",
      "Robert also loved to buy her gifts, most notably jewellery, no fewer than five pieces a year. She also accumulated countless handbags.",
      "When Robert died after having a stroke in 2019, Bradford was totally devastated.",
      "\"We were everything to each other,\" she said. \"But I have to keep going. Bob always thought I was a strong woman. He liked strong women - never had time for those little fragile blondes.\"",
      "She had auctioned off some pieces of jewellery in 2013 and, following his death and her move into a smaller apartment, Bradford sold more, saying she just didn't have enough room.",
      "Eventually, Bradford found some solace by turning to her most-loved original characters, announcing she was writing a prequel to A Woman of Substance, this time focusing on Emma Harte's great friend Shane \"Blackie\" O'Neill.",

      "\"Bob was by my side at the beginning when I wrote A Woman of Substance,\" she said, \"and I felt compelled to tell Blackie's story. The true Blackie O'Neill will be revealed and fans of Emma Harte will be able to live his tumultuous life with him.\"",

I say it to shock them. That is the wrong motivation. You should want to do the work so much that nothing else matters. I simply had to write fiction.\""

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 01:34:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Forty years on, the Band Aid song continues to generate debate about the way it presents Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "\"Festival prices and ticket prices have gone up drastically, but the musicians' wage hasn't,\" she said.",

      "Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood).",

      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",

      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",

      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",

      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",

      "They were part of the campaign which led to a law to safeguard venues under threat from developers.",
      "Matlock is back on the road again, and has spoken about his unexpected friendship with former Cardiff West MP Brennan - now a top aide to Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan - and their fight to keep music live.",

      "Miners' strike rage fuelled Manics success - Wire",
      "Five ways Taylor Swift stole Welsh hearts",
      "His solo tour includes two shows in Wales, and follows a reunion with fellow Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones - although not John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, after the famously tempestuous band fell out once again.",
      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",
      "Now their bassist and main songwriter is focused on ensuring today's bands still have somewhere to play.",
      "\"I was involved with The Musicians' Union,\" he said. \"There was a photocall outside Parliament about the Agent of Change Act, calling for action to protect music venues.",
      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",
      "\"It's great that people picked up on it, and here I am still gigging, speaking out and getting to see the world.\"",

      "The number of single women having treatment, including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), has increased from 1,400 in 2012 to 4,800 in 2022, while the number of female couples treated has doubled to 3,300 over the same period.",
      "Heterosexual couples still account for nearly 90% of all IVF treatments.",

      "Growing numbers of different family groups are seeking fertility treatment.",
      "Heterosexual couples had 47,000 IVF or donor insemination (DI) treatments in 2022, up from 45,300 in 2012.",
      "But one in six of all private and NHS fertility treatments in the UK is now accessed by single women and female same-sex couples, according to The Human and Fertilisation Embryology Authority (HFEA) report.",

      "She set up LGBT Mummies, an organisation which gives advice to people on becoming parents and campaigns for equal access to fertility treatment.",
      "\"The whole system needs to be reviewed,\" she adds.",
      "Many heterosexual couples also describe the challenges of multiple rounds of IVF and the rollercoaster of emotions going through years of treatment.",
      "'Expensive treatments'",
      "NHS funding for fertility treatment continues to fall.",
      "It now pays for just 27% of IVF cycles, down from 40% in 2012.",
      "Among 18-39 year olds having their first treatment, heterosexual couples receive 52% of NHS-funded cycles, with female couples accounting for 16% and single women 18% - both a slight rise.",
      "The HFEA report says IVF is \"one of the most invasive and expensive treatments per cycle\".",
      "But more female couples and single women are choosing it, for several reasons, including the:",

      "IVF birth rates are higher among single women and female couples, who are less likely than heterosexual couples to be having the treatment because of infertility problems - and who may also be waiting for other treatment.",

    "title": "Supreme Court hearing case on definition of a woman",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:12:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Judges will consider a legal challenge which could affect how women and trans people are treated.",
    "story": [
      "Judges at the Supreme Court are considering how women are defined in law in a landmark case brought by Scottish campaigners.",
      "It is the culmination of a long-running legal dispute which started with a relatively niche piece of legislation at the Scottish Parliament, but which could have big UK-wide implications.",
      "It will set out exactly how the law is meant to treat trans people, and what it really means to go through the gender recognition process.",
      "And it could have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, and how measures aimed at tackling discrimination will operate in future",
      "What will this case decide?",
      "The case started on Tuesday, with judges hearing from lawyers acting on behalf of the For Women Scotland campaign group, which is concerned about the potential impact of trans rights on women's rights.",
      "The Scottish government's legal representatives will address the court on Wednesday, before the judges retire to consider their ruling - which could take several weeks.",
      "At the most basic level, the case centres on what \u201csex\u201d actually means in law.",
      "Is it about biology and chromosomes set at birth, or does it tie in ideas of gender identity and the gender recognition process?",
      "The Gender Recognition Act of 2004 established the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate - something it states amounts to a change of sex \u201cfor all purposes\u201d.",
      "When someone gets a gender recognition certificate, \"if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person's sex becomes that of a man, and if it is the female gender, the person's sex becomes that of a woman\".",
      "Then the Equality Act of 2010 came along to set out legal protections against discrimination for specific groups - with \u201csex\u201d, \"sexual orientation\" and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d included as protected characteristics.",
      "It simply defines a woman as \"a female of any age\".",
      "There has been much dispute about how these two pieces of legislation sit together.",
      "When the Equality Act talks about \u201csex\u201d, does it mean biological sex - or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the GRA?",
      "This case won\u2019t change the letter of the law, but a ruling on how it should be interpreted could have big implications for how all kinds of public bodies and services operate, and whether others might be open to legal challenges.",
      "There has been particular controversy in light of the debate about whether the gender recognition process should be streamlined - there was a lengthy wrangle at Holyrood over \u201cself-identification\u201d reforms.",
      "Those were ultimately blocked by the UK government, which claimed they would have a \"significant impact\" on the Equality Act.",
      "But it plays into a number of other rows, with Scotland\u2019s Rape Crisis network currently in turmoil about how its centres define women and provide single-sex spaces.",
      "Public bodies have expressed frustration about a lack of clarity around interpretation of the law, having been left to work out policy on their own.",
      "Police Scotland - which has faced questions over how it treats transgender people - has criticised an \u201cabsence of direction\u201d from politicians in Edinburgh and London over how to reconcile the gender recognition process with the Equality Act.",
      "With political leaders increasingly wary of the topic and the fierce debates which go along with it, it has ultimately fallen to the courts to adjudicate.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "MSPs at Holyrood passed the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act in 2018, with the aim of getting more women onto public sector boards.",
      "That law\u2019s definition of \u201cwoman\u201d included people who were \u201cliving as a woman\u201d and were currently or proposing to undergo the gender reassignment process.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland challenged this in court, and after a series of appeals they eventually prevailed.",
      "Judges ruled that the definition used \u201cconflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics\u201d laid out in the Equality Act - a reserved piece of legislation which MSPs do not have the power to alter.",
      "The Scottish government had to amend the bill to remove the definition.",
      "But at the same time they issued new guidance alongside the legislation, stating that it would include women as defined by the Equality Act - and also the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), to the effect that a full gender recognition certificate could be taken as a declaration of someone\u2019s sex \u201cfor all purposes\u201d.",
      "For Women Scotland challenged this guidance in a fresh judicial review, which ended in defeat.",
      "Judge Lady Haldane ruled in December 2022 that the definition of sex was \u201cnot limited to biological or birth sex\u201d, but included those in possession of a gender recognition certificate.",
      "That ruling is what For Women Scotland are challenging at the Supreme Court.",
      "They have already lost one appeal in the Scottish courts, but judges in Edinburgh agreed to push the case straight to the Supreme Court in London for a definitive ruling.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "The issue being considered by the court is whether \u201ca person with a full gender recognition certificate - which recognises their gender is female - is a \u2018woman\u2019 for the purposes of the Equality Act\u201d.",
      "Aidan O'Neill KC, representing For Women Scotland, described that premise as a \"legal fiction\".",
      "He argued for the \"common sense\" meaning of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\u201d.",
      "The KC said that definition of sex was necessary to protect the rights of women.",
      "For Women Scotland argue the Equality Act supersedes the GRA thanks to a subsection of the 2004 Act which nods to it being subject to \u201cprovision made by \u2026 any other enactment\u201d.",
      "Mr O'Neill denied that For Women Scotland's case was \"transphobic\", arguing that it could never have been parliament\u2019s intention for equality law to have \u201cabsurd or nonsensical outcomes\u201d.",
      "He gave the example of a heterosexual man getting a full GRC. He said they would in theory become a same-sex attracted woman. The court heard this could leave lesbian associations with \"no choice but to admit natal men into their ranks\u201d.",
      "The lawyer said this and several other examples he gave were evidence of the patriarchy in action. He said the court should not \u201ccapitulate\u201d to the patriarchy, urging judges to \u201cconfront\u201d it.",
      "He raised the issue of women-only spaces such as hospital wards, refuges and prisons and said admissions could be decided only by the \u201cpaperwork\u201d of a GRC.",
      "The Scottish government meanwhile essentially argues that the two pieces of legislation are clear in their language, and that MPs knew what they were doing when they passed them.",
      "It says there is \"no express provision\" made in the Equality Act to affect the GRA's wording that a certificate changes someone's sex.",
      "Indeed it says there are \"clear indications\" in the 2010 Act that the GRA \"is intended to continue to have full effect\" - \"namely to reflect, by way of a person having acquired another gender, a change as a matter of law in their sex\".",
      "Ruth Crawford KC will speak for the Scottish government.",
      "Five judges will hear their arguments - headed by the court's president, Lord Reed - and will retire to consider them before issuing a judgement at a later date.",
      "What could the implications be?",
      "This issue has become so emotive because people on both sides see it as a threat to their very identity.",
      "The most recent census found there were 19,990 people in Scotland who were trans, or had a trans history - under 0.5% of the adult population.",
      "The figure for England and Wales is also around 0.5% - 262,000 people told the last census that their gender identity and birth sex were different.",
      "There is uncertainty around the true figures, with census returns thought to be overestimated - but what we know for sure is that 1,088 full gender recognition certificates were granted across the UK in 2023-24, up from 867 the previous year.",
      "The figure has been rising since application costs were cut - and in the context of this case, it is people with full GRCs who are central.",
      "Beyond this, equalities groups stress that there are a great many minority groups which are protected by the Equality Act, and see this case as potentially being the \"thin end of the wedge\" which could undermine their rights.",
      "For trans people, they say it could erode the protections against discrimination they have under their reassigned gender.",
      "If someone has a gender recognition certificate attesting that they are a woman, are they entitled to protection from sex discrimination under the Equality Act? Could they make an equal pay claim as a woman?",
      "The UK\u2019s first trans judge - who unsuccessfully applied to intervene in this case - is said to have pursued a pensions claim along those very lines against the Ministry of Justice.",
      "Meanwhile women\u2019s groups also say the ruling will have an impact on a large group - literally half of the population.",
      "They say it could affect the running of single-sex services and spaces. Things like support groups for victims of sexual abuse can only legally justify excluding men due to the Equality Act\u2019s protections.",
      "Campaigners say everything from hospital wards to refuges and sports events might have to change policy or find themselves open to legal challenges based on the court's ruling.",
      "Lesbian groups - protected under \"sexual orientation\" in the 2010 Act - also say it could affect their ability to have exclusive clubs.",
      "There could also be political implications.",
      "Some groups see the case as a reason to clarify the actual wording of the law, by having MPs amend the Equality Act itself.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - the national equalities regulator, which is intervening in the case - has called for this.",
      "They say that MPs did intend to include those with a gender recognition certificate as having changed their sex when they passed the Act in 2010, but that they may not have appreciated consequences which \"jeopardise the rights and interests of women and same-sex attracted people\".",
      "They say this is a \"wholly unsatisfactory situation, which parliament should address with urgency\".",
      "But some other equalities groups oppose \"reopening\" the Equality Act, seeing it as a move which could see the rights of protected groups watered down.",
      "And it's not clear that there is the political will for governments to wade into this topic.",
      "The Scottish government previously tried to take the lead, when Nicola Sturgeon led the charge with self-identification reforms.",
      "But her successors as first minister have backed away from these issues, with current first minister John Swinney pushing plans for a ban on conversion therapy onto the UK government's desk by calling for a four-nation approach.",
      "At a UK level, rewriting the Equality Act was a Conservative pledge during the election campaign - and not one which Sir Keir Starmer matched.",
      "Indeed Labour's manifesto promised to \"simplify and reform\" the gender recognition process, removing \"indignities\".",
      "As well as affecting the interpretation of the law as it stands, the ruling in this case could reignite calls for reform in parliament itself."

      "Following a social media outcry, the insurers backed down, saying: \u201cThe welfare of Ms Rubens and her family remains our priority.\"",
      "\u201cWe were already having the worst time,\u201d her daughter Cat, 34, who is a lawyer, told the BBC.  \u201cMum may not survive this, we just don\u2019t know.  And then to have to deal with all this.\u201d",
      "Mrs Rubens was on holiday visiting family in Missouri when she was hit by an SUV in St Louis on 1 November.  She sustained severe brain injuries and multiple haemorrhages.",
      "Since then she has been a patient at St Louis University Hospital, where she has undergone five different operations including a craniectomy where part of her skull was removed. The most recent surgery was on Thursday.",
      "Prior to travelling, her family say Mrs Rubens took out a travel insurance policy with AXA Partners, which covered medical expenses for up to \u00a315m ($19m).",
      "On Friday the insurance company contacted her two children Cat and Andrew, who are by her bedside, to say they intended to require her repatriation to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh this week.",
      "On Saturday, the family sent a letter to AXA Partners outlining the medical advice they had received, not just from her doctors in Missouri but also from NHS specialists to whom they had spoken, as well as the brain injuries charity Headway.  All agreed that from a neurological stand-point, she needed several more weeks in the United States.",

We have availability to proceed with the repatriation on 25/11/2024.  If you do not accept our decisions and do not want to be repatriated, then we will not provide any cover.\u201d",

      "While the problem is undoubtedly bigger in men - particularly older men - more women under the age of 45 are dying due to alcohol-related liver disease, or ARLD, than ever before, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures from 2001-22.",
      "If we binge a given amount of alcohol in one go - for example on a night out - it can be much more damaging than if we drink the same amount over a longer period.",
      "The latest research, by a team at University College London and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, suggests bingeing may be up to four times as damaging for the liver.",
      "When we think of binge drinking, we tend to imagine people drunkenly sprawling out of bars and falling over at bus stops. But actually,  a binge can be less alcohol than you might think.",
      "In the UK, a binge is considered as drinking six or more units of alcohol in one sitting for women, and eight or more for men. That is two large glasses of wine for a woman.",
      "At King's College Hospital in London, consultant hepatologist Debbie Shawcross tells me that she regularly treats professional women in their 40s and 50s with liver disease.",
      "\u201cThey're spinning plates in the air, and maybe they have young families,\u201d she says. \u201cThey're not alcoholics... but they are just drinking too much as a habit.\u201d",
      "I\u2019m not in my 40s yet, but she could have been describing me.",
      "When I was younger, I would easily drink more than what\u2019s defined as a binge on a night out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until I got my diagnosis.",
      "After my blood tests came back as abnormal I was sent to Glasgow\u2019s New Victoria Hospital, where I had an ultrasound, and finally a fibroscan. All this took place over the course of about a year.",
      "A fibroscan is a type of non-invasive ultrasound which measures liver stiffness. A reading of seven kPA (a unit used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood) or below is considered normal. My reading was 10.2.",
      "This indicated severe scarring - if it had not been caught, and if I had not stopped drinking, it could have developed into cirrhosis.",
      "I received my diagnosis in February 2024. My consultant, Dr Shouren Datta, said if I abstained from alcohol, then there was a possibility that my fibrosis could be reversed.",
      "I feel extremely lucky that the problem was picked up in time for me to try to do something about it.",
      "Doctors had discovered the problem while investigating my tiredness.",

      "That is what happened to Emma Jones, 39, originally from north Wales. I met her 15 months after her successful liver transplant.",
      "Like me, Emma was a social drinker, with a successful career and vibrant social life. But during the Covid lockdowns things spiralled for her - at the worst point, she was drinking three bottles of wine a day.",
      "Emma was admitted to hospital where she found out she was in end-stage liver disease. She was given less than 36 hours to live.",
      "Miraculously, she pulled through and - after fulfilling the required six months of sobriety - got the transplant she so desperately needed.",
      "Emma\u2019s recovery is ongoing and is not without major life changes. She will be on anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life and is immunosuppressed, meaning it is harder for her body to fight infections and disease.",
      "But she is alive, well, and says she is in the best place she has ever been. I find her positivity and determination infectious.",

      "According to the most recent ONS statistics, from 2018, liver disease is consistently among the top three causes of death each year among women aged 39-45.",
      "\u201cWomen's drinking pretty much doubled in a really short period of time\u2026 about 10 years,\u201d Prof Fiona Measham, a leading expert in drink and drug culture from the University of Liverpool, tells me.",
      "Her research suggests that in the 1990s and 2000s, the alcohol industry zeroed in on female drinkers, targeting them with products such as alcopops and shots - and using feminism, female empowerment and liberation as a marketing tool.",
      "She thinks these practices established a drinking culture in a whole generation of young women that would leave a lasting legacy.",
      "\u201cWhat we're seeing now is that young people, their consumption is falling fastest, but it's still holding quite steady for people in their 30s, 40s and 50s,\u201d she says.",
      "The same aggressive approach persists today within the alcohol industry, believes Prof Carol Emslie, from Glasgow Caledonian University. Only now it is pushing things like prosecco, \u201cgin o\u2019clock\u201d and \u201cwine time\u201d as a way for women to relax and practise self-care after a hard day.",
      "The Portman Group, which represents the alcohol industry, says:",
      "While \u201cthe increase in alcohol-related liver disease among both women and men in the UK is a serious concern, it\u2019s important to remember that alcohol has always been a legal product.\u201d",
      "It says its Code of Practice\u2026 \u201cdoes not protect against gender-based marketing specifically\u201d but sets \u201cminimum standards for alcohol producers to market their products responsibly\u201d.",

    "summary": "A toxic row has engulfed the NHS, say ministers. So why have doctors turned on physician associates?",
    "story": [
      "Julia\u2019s first four years as a physician associate were everything she hoped they would be. After working in the NHS for the best part of a decade in a non-patient facing role, she was delighted to be on the wards supporting doctors and the wider healthcare teams.",
      "\u201cI loved the contact I had with patients, assessing them and playing a part in their care. I felt supported and part of a team.\u201d",
      "That all changed about a year ago.",
      "\u201cSuddenly we came under attack. Doctors in the radiology department started refusing to talk to me about scans and others have been saying we don\u2019t deserve to get paid what we do.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere has totally changed. We\u2019ve even stopped going into the canteen as we were being made to feel uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "'Destructive situation'",
      "Julia is far from alone. United Medical Associate Professionals (UMAPs), a body which represents physician (PAs) and anaesthesia associate (AAs), says there are countless examples like this with staff facing bullying and being sidelined.",
      "The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents senior doctors in the NHS, has warned the whole situation has become so \u201cdestructive\u201d that it is damaging teamwork across hospitals and GP surgeries where PAs and AAs work.",
      "It has cited the particularly acrimonious debate on social media, which has seen regular attacks about the pay and professionalism of PAs and AAs as well as discussions about how they can be undermined in the workplace.",
      "This week the Health Secretary Wes Streeting decided he needed to act, ordering a review into PAs and AAs in England to resolve what he said had become a \u201ctoxic\u201d row.",
      "So how has it come to this, with doctors turning against the very people brought in to support them?",
      "The PA role is hardly new in the NHS \u2013 it has been around for 20 years, helping doctors by doing tasks such as taking medical histories and carrying out examinations.",
      "What has changed is the speed at which they are being recruited \u2013 over the last seven years the numbers have gone from a few hundred to 3,500 currently with a target of 12,000, including AAs, by 2036.",
      "'More of a hindrance than a help'",
      "As the numbers have been increasing doctors have become concerned the lines between professions are getting blurred.",
      "Sam is five years into his training and works alongside PAs in a hospital in the south west. \u201cThey are more of a hindrance than a help,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re being placed on rotas instead of doctors \u2013 but there are things they cannot do so doctors end up having to double up.",
      "\u201cAnd for those doctors at the very start of training having PAs on a ward can actually limit their exposure to some of the medical tasks that should be part of their learning. We\u2019ve had enough.\u201d",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), is so concerned it now wants the rollout to be paused while the review takes place.",
      "It says PAs and AAs, who need to complete a two-year master\u2019s following a first degree, which is normally bioscience-related, are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and filling in for doctors. It argues this is putting patients at risk.",
      "To back up its claims, it points to two high-profile cases where patients \u2013 Emily Chesterton and Susan Pollitt - died after being seen by PAs.",
      "Alongside this, the BMA also cites a survey published last year of 18,000 of its members, which found nearly nine in 10 of those that responded felt the way AAs and PAs currently work in the NHS always or sometimes posed a risk to patient safety.",
      "BMA deputy council leader Dr Emma Runswick says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing PAs doing things, such as ordering scans they are not qualified to order and prescribing drugs that they aren't qualified to prescribe.",
      "\"And when they see patients it\u2019s not always clear to the patient that they are not being seen by a doctor. It\u2019s dangerous and has got to stop.\u201d",
      "The union is calling for a strict set of rules to be drawn up limiting what they can and cannot do. The BMA\u2019s plan would essentially restrict their role to assistants \u2013 helping with ward rounds, taking bloods and chasing up on scan results and making discharge arrangements.",
      "But UMAPs chief Stephen Nash says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about patient safety, but about protecting their interests. They want us to be subservient.\u201d",
      "He says the deaths like those reported are \u201cabsolute tragedies\u201d, but he has concerns about how they are being used to attack a whole profession.",
      "\u201cThere is meant to be a no-blame approach to learning the lessons from failures.\u201d",
      "He says when mistakes are made there are often multiple factors at play, but the campaign against PAs and AAs has meant their role has been singled out. \u201cIt misleads the public,\" he adds.",
      "In the end it will be up to the independent review, which is being led by Royal Society of Medicine president Prof Gillian Leng, to establish the truth on this.",
      "Key will be the NHS England database on patient safety incidents, which services across the country report into.",
      "The data for the past year is not publicly available, but a senior NHS source told me: \u201cThe key here is not whether PAs are making mistakes \u2013 everyone in the NHS does, doctors included \u2013 but whether they are making more mistakes and causing more safety incidents than you would expect.",
      "\"The reports are complex and nuanced quite often, but there\u2019s nothing in there that immediately rings alarm bells.\u201d",
      "This is not just a row that has been played out on the wards of hospitals and consulting rooms of GP surgeries, it has stretched to the highest echelons of the world of medicine.",
      "While the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has remained broadly supportive of the rollout of PAs and AAs, a number of the 23 individual colleges it represents have been engulfed by infighting over the issue, leading to resignations.",
      "'Relationships damaged permanently'",
      "The Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of GPs (RCGP) and Royal College of Anaesthetists have all recently moved towards opposition.",
      "One source close to what has been happening at the royal colleges says: \u201cThere have been some huge rows \u2013 I fear relationships have been damaged permanently. As royal colleges we were always traditionally above the politics of trade unionism.",
      "\u201cThere is a group of doctors that see PAs and AAs as a threat \u2013 we saw the same when nurses took on extra responsibility years ago.\u201d",
      "The lawyers have also been brought in with UMAPs considering action against the RCGP, believing its opposition has cost some PAs their jobs.",
      "And the BMA has already launched a legal case against the General Medical Council, which next month is due to start regulating PAs and AAs. The union does not want the same body responsible for regulating doctors to do the same for PAs and AAs, believing it will blur the lines even further.",
      "What is clear is that this dispute will not be easy to resolve.",
      "And in the meantime, the staff on the frontline are being left to muddle on.",
      "\u201cPAs and AAs are worried every time they go into work,\u201d says Mr Nash. \u201cA very powerful lobby within the medical profession has turned against them. It\u2019s a really horrible time.\u201d"

      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",

      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",
      "\u201cBut I think there's rightful concern based on other issues and how his approach to those issues might play in here.\u201d",

      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",

      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",

      "But it plays into a number of other rows, with Scotland\u2019s Rape Crisis network currently in turmoil about how its centres define women and provide single-sex spaces.",
      "Public bodies have expressed frustration about a lack of clarity around interpretation of the law, having been left to work out policy on their own.",
      "Police Scotland - which has faced questions over how it treats transgender people - has criticised an \u201cabsence of direction\u201d from politicians in Edinburgh and London over how to reconcile the gender recognition process with the Equality Act.",
      "With political leaders increasingly wary of the topic and the fierce debates which go along with it, it has ultimately fallen to the courts to adjudicate.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "MSPs at Holyrood passed the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act in 2018, with the aim of getting more women onto public sector boards.",
      "That law\u2019s definition of \u201cwoman\u201d included people who were \u201cliving as a woman\u201d and were currently or proposing to undergo the gender reassignment process.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland challenged this in court, and after a series of appeals they eventually prevailed.",
      "Judges ruled that the definition used \u201cconflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics\u201d laid out in the Equality Act - a reserved piece of legislation which MSPs do not have the power to alter.",
      "The Scottish government had to amend the bill to remove the definition.",
      "But at the same time they issued new guidance alongside the legislation, stating that it would include women as defined by the Equality Act - and also the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), to the effect that a full gender recognition certificate could be taken as a declaration of someone\u2019s sex \u201cfor all purposes\u201d.",
      "For Women Scotland challenged this guidance in a fresh judicial review, which ended in defeat.",
      "Judge Lady Haldane ruled in December 2022 that the definition of sex was \u201cnot limited to biological or birth sex\u201d, but included those in possession of a gender recognition certificate.",
      "That ruling is what For Women Scotland are challenging at the Supreme Court.",
      "They have already lost one appeal in the Scottish courts, but judges in Edinburgh agreed to push the case straight to the Supreme Court in London for a definitive ruling.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "The issue being considered by the court is whether \u201ca person with a full gender recognition certificate - which recognises their gender is female - is a \u2018woman\u2019 for the purposes of the Equality Act\u201d.",
      "Aidan O'Neill KC, representing For Women Scotland, described that premise as a \"legal fiction\".",
      "He argued for the \"common sense\" meaning of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\u201d.",
      "The KC said that definition of sex was necessary to protect the rights of women.",
      "For Women Scotland argue the Equality Act supersedes the GRA thanks to a subsection of the 2004 Act which nods to it being subject to \u201cprovision made by \u2026 any other enactment\u201d.",
      "Mr O'Neill denied that For Women Scotland's case was \"transphobic\", arguing that it could never have been parliament\u2019s intention for equality law to have \u201cabsurd or nonsensical outcomes\u201d.",
      "He gave the example of a heterosexual man getting a full GRC. He said they would in theory become a same-sex attracted woman. The court heard this could leave lesbian associations with \"no choice but to admit natal men into their ranks\u201d.",
      "The lawyer said this and several other examples he gave were evidence of the patriarchy in action. He said the court should not \u201ccapitulate\u201d to the patriarchy, urging judges to \u201cconfront\u201d it.",
      "He raised the issue of women-only spaces such as hospital wards, refuges and prisons and said admissions could be decided only by the \u201cpaperwork\u201d of a GRC.",
      "The Scottish government meanwhile essentially argues that the two pieces of legislation are clear in their language, and that MPs knew what they were doing when they passed them.",
      "It says there is \"no express provision\" made in the Equality Act to affect the GRA's wording that a certificate changes someone's sex.",
      "Indeed it says there are \"clear indications\" in the 2010 Act that the GRA \"is intended to continue to have full effect\" - \"namely to reflect, by way of a person having acquired another gender, a change as a matter of law in their sex\".",
      "Ruth Crawford KC will speak for the Scottish government.",
      "Five judges will hear their arguments - headed by the court's president, Lord Reed - and will retire to consider them before issuing a judgement at a later date.",
      "What could the implications be?",
      "This issue has become so emotive because people on both sides see it as a threat to their very identity.",
      "The most recent census found there were 19,990 people in Scotland who were trans, or had a trans history - under 0.5% of the adult population.",
      "The figure for England and Wales is also around 0.5% - 262,000 people told the last census that their gender identity and birth sex were different.",
      "There is uncertainty around the true figures, with census returns thought to be overestimated - but what we know for sure is that 1,088 full gender recognition certificates were granted across the UK in 2023-24, up from 867 the previous year.",
      "The figure has been rising since application costs were cut - and in the context of this case, it is people with full GRCs who are central.",
      "Beyond this, equalities groups stress that there are a great many minority groups which are protected by the Equality Act, and see this case as potentially being the \"thin end of the wedge\" which could undermine their rights.",
      "For trans people, they say it could erode the protections against discrimination they have under their reassigned gender.",
      "If someone has a gender recognition certificate attesting that they are a woman, are they entitled to protection from sex discrimination under the Equality Act? Could they make an equal pay claim as a woman?",
      "The UK\u2019s first trans judge - who unsuccessfully applied to intervene in this case - is said to have pursued a pensions claim along those very lines against the Ministry of Justice.",
      "Meanwhile women\u2019s groups also say the ruling will have an impact on a large group - literally half of the population.",
      "They say it could affect the running of single-sex services and spaces. Things like support groups for victims of sexual abuse can only legally justify excluding men due to the Equality Act\u2019s protections.",
      "Campaigners say everything from hospital wards to refuges and sports events might have to change policy or find themselves open to legal challenges based on the court's ruling.",
      "Lesbian groups - protected under \"sexual orientation\" in the 2010 Act - also say it could affect their ability to have exclusive clubs.",
      "There could also be political implications.",
      "Some groups see the case as a reason to clarify the actual wording of the law, by having MPs amend the Equality Act itself.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - the national equalities regulator, which is intervening in the case - has called for this.",
      "They say that MPs did intend to include those with a gender recognition certificate as having changed their sex when they passed the Act in 2010, but that they may not have appreciated consequences which \"jeopardise the rights and interests of women and same-sex attracted people\".",
      "They say this is a \"wholly unsatisfactory situation, which parliament should address with urgency\".",
      "But some other equalities groups oppose \"reopening\" the Equality Act, seeing it as a move which could see the rights of protected groups watered down.",
      "And it's not clear that there is the political will for governments to wade into this topic.",
      "The Scottish government previously tried to take the lead, when Nicola Sturgeon led the charge with self-identification reforms.",
      "But her successors as first minister have backed away from these issues, with current first minister John Swinney pushing plans for a ban on conversion therapy onto the UK government's desk by calling for a four-nation approach.",
      "At a UK level, rewriting the Equality Act was a Conservative pledge during the election campaign - and not one which Sir Keir Starmer matched.",
      "Indeed Labour's manifesto promised to \"simplify and reform\" the gender recognition process, removing \"indignities\".",
      "As well as affecting the interpretation of the law as it stands, the ruling in this case could reignite calls for reform in parliament itself."

      "She said she was \"profoundly concerned\" by the legislation, not just for religious reasons but because it could create a \"slippery slope towards death on demand\" and argued the government must \u201cprotect and preserve life, not take it away\u201d.",
      "Mahmood added that scandals like Hillsborough, infected blood and the Post Office Horizon \"reminded us that the state and those acting on its behalf are not always benign\".",

      "He added that while religious views came into his stance on the issue, \"it's important to put the secular argument that people can understand - that it is possible to avoid so much of the pain that people are experiencing and we haven\u2019t invested enough in doing that\".",

    "summary": "Government claims have been hotly contested by farmers, and the BBC has been scrutinised for its analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Since the government unveiled its new inheritance tax plans for farmers in last month\u2019s Budget, there has been intense debate about how many people will be affected and to what extent.",
      "Many of the claims from the government have been hotly contested by farmers, and BBC Verify has come under scrutiny over some of the figures it has relied on to try to establish the number of farms impacted by the change.",
      "The debate has revolved around estimates provided by farmers\u2019 groups, including that the new tax could \"harm\" up to 70,000 farms over time.",
      "Our analysis found that the figure was likely to be somewhere closer to the number provided by the government - about 500 estates per year. That remains our assessment.",
      "Farmers' groups say the changes have been \u201cbuilt on bad data\u201d. The government says it wants to make the inheritance tax system fairer and discourage wealthy people from investing in land solely to avoid the tax.",
      "Here, we go through all the numbers and examine the claims and counter-claims.",
      "What are the contested figures?",
      "Under the government\u2019s plans, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be subject to inheritance tax at 20%.",
      "The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has estimated that the tax change  \u201ccould harm\u201d 70,000 UK farms. This would represent roughly 33% of the 209,000 UK farms, as identified by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "The CLA figure is not an annual one and, clearly, a farm would only be potentially subject to inheritance tax if it was passed on, following a death.",
      "The government, in trying to assess the impact of its tax change, looked instead at recent figures for the number of actual claims for tax relief for agricultural estates.",
      "At this point, it\u2019s worth stressing that an agricultural estate is not the same as a landed estate, or farm: an \u201cestate\u201d is a legal term for the value of the money, property and possessions an individual passes on upon their death. In this case, it\u2019s an estate that includes some agricultural land.",
      "The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has claimed up to about 520 inherited agricultural estates a year \u201cwill be impacted to some extent by these changes\u201d.",
      "The Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said \"three quarters of farmers will pay nothing as a result of the changes\u201d.",
      "But farming groups continue to dispute the government figures, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) pointing to other figures from Defra which it says \u201cshow that only 34% of farms are under \u00a31 million net worth\u201d. This would imply that around two thirds of farms could potentially be affected by the Budget tax change.",
      "The NFU has also released analysis which it says shows that \u201caround 75% of commercial family farms will be above the \u00a31 million threshold\u201d.",
      "Below, we look into the challenges when it comes to reaching an exact conclusion on the numbers affected, and provide more detail on which figures are more reliable - and explain why.",
      "Is Defra data more accurate?",
      "Farming groups have partially based their arguments against the tax change on data from Defra\u2019s Farm Business Survey, which shows the net worth of farms in England in 2022/23.",
      "The figures suggest that 17% of farms in England have a net worth - the difference between their assets and liabilities - of between \u00a31m and \u00a31.49m. Another 49% of farms have a value of \u00a31.5m and over.",
      "This suggests, on the face of it, that 66% of farms in England could potentially be affected by the tax changes.",
      "However there are some problems with this calculation, as the data from the Defra survey is not necessarily representative of the overall UK-wide farming sector.",
      "The survey - which is based on a sample of just over 1,350 farms  - states that it is designed to be representative of only about half of the farms in England (rather than the rest of the UK) and also excludes farms which bring in little revenue.",
      "Moreover, the Defra data shows estimates of individual farm values, but does not show their ownership.",
      "Multiple farms can be owned by a single person who then lets them out to tenants. In England about 46% of agricultural holdings were wholly or partially rented out to tenant farmers in 2023 according to Defra data. If the owner of multiple farms sought to pass on those farms upon his or her death, this would all show up in a single estate in the inheritance tax relief claim.",
      "The financial impact would be on that individual\u2019s inheritance tax bill, not each farm.",
      "A farm could also be jointly owned by multiple people. If, for example, five people owned a \u00a35m farm they could each pass on their \u00a31m share without their estates having to pay any inheritance tax.",
      "This is why it is more appropriate to use tax data on inheritance relief, rather than farm survey data, to estimate the impact of the change in the Budget on individuals.",
      "Does including business property relief change the picture?",
      "Another challenge is that some initial government calculations of the number of estates likely to be affected only referred to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and not Business Property Relief (BPR).",
      "APR relates mainly to the value of land. BPR can include a farm's machinery and livestock, which can also make up a significant proportion of the value of an agricultural estate.",
      "It is true that both APR and BPR relief will be capped at a combined \u00a31m for inheritance tax purposes, meaning a single estate will be able to claim no more than \u00a31m in these combined reliefs.",
      "Farming groups have claimed that farmers often also use BPR so any calculation of the impact of the tax changes based solely on APR claims will not capture the full effect on farming estates.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "However, the government has now published figures based on HMRC inheritance tax data which incorporate historical APR and BPR relief claims, and should capture those agricultural estates making use of both reliefs.",
      "These figures suggest that while taking BPR into account as well as APR does push up the number and proportion of estates likely to be affected, it does not fundamentally change the picture.",
      "The data shows that in 2021-22 the number of estates making combined APR and BPR claims where the value of the estate was more than \u00a31.5m was 383, or 22% of all claims.",
      "The number of estates worth more than \u00a31.5m making APR claims solely was 278, or 16% of the total.",
      "Why is it \u00a31.5m and not \u00a31m?",
      "The government\u2019s latest figures break down the impact using the threshold of \u00a31.5m, not \u00a31m, explaining to BBC Verify that this was chosen based on the assumption that an individual estate\u2019s standard inheritance tax reliefs of \u00a3500,000 would be added to their new \u00a31m allowance.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury and HMRC for a breakdown of the figures using \u00a31m as a threshold - which would be consistent with its original calculations showing APR claims only - but it said it hasn't collated those figures.",
      "The CenTax think tank has studied the impact of APR and BPR reliefs.",
      "CenTax\u2019s co-director Arun Advani argues that the government\u2019s estimates of the number of agricultural estates likely to be affected by the capping of both reliefs at \u00a31m combined - up to 520 estates a year - seems reasonable.",
      "\u201cThe data on historic claims are a much more reliable guide to the number of affected estates than surveys of farm sizes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhile the government's reforms are certainly likely to be difficult for some farmers, particularly given the many other factors weighing down farmer's incomes, numbers claiming tens of thousands will be affected aren't consistent with the evidence.\u201d",
      "David Sturrock from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that the Treasury\u2019s figures were \u201ccredible\u201d and added that including the impact of capping BPR \u201cdoesn\u2019t radically change the picture in terms of estates affected\u201d.",
      "The NFU has pointed out that if 500 estates were affected per year that could amount to 15,000 over 30 years - but this would still be some way short of the 70,000 figure.",
      "Should small estates be excluded from calculations?",
      "The NFU argues that many estates included in the government figures are too small to be considered working farms.",
      "Its case is simple - if you were to exclude these small farms, the percentage of real, working farms affected would be much higher.",
      "It has pointed to separate APR inheritance tax relief claims data from HMRC, via the Treasury, which breaks down estates by size.",
      "This shows that in 2021-22, 474 claims (27% of the 1,730 total) were for estates valued between \u00a30 and \u00a3250,000, and that 398 (23% of the total) were for estates valued at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.",
      "\u201cVery few viable farms are worth under \u00a31m,\u201d says the NFU president Tom Bradshaw.",
      "That's a reasonable argument.",
      "If estates with a value below \u00a3500,000 were excluded from the APR figures, the share of the total affected each year would automatically rise from the 27% implied by the government\u2019s initial calculations.",
      "The NFU\u2019s analysis suggests only including what it categorises as \u201cworking farms\u201d would increase the share affected from 27% to 49%.",
      "However, the estimated absolute number of affected estates - roughly 500 in each year - would not be affected by that change.",
      "Is there a \u00a33m allowance?",
      "A key question is where the effective financial inheritance tax threshold for estates with agricultural assets kicks in.",
      "Farming groups have suggested the value of any inherited estate with agricultural assets over \u00a31m will be impacted.",
      "This is understandable as this was the threshold figure cited in the Budget.",
      "However, the government has since claimed that the effective threshold for many farmers\u2019 estates to pay inheritance tax could be not \u00a31m, but \u00a33m, because of various inheritance tax reliefs available to estates.",
      "A higher effective threshold would have a major impact on the proportion and number of estates affected.",
      "The government\u2019s claim is based on the fact that the estates of farmers, like the estates of everyone else subject to inheritance tax, are eligible for a standard tax-free allowance, known as a nil-rate band, of \u00a3325,000.",
      "They are are also eligible for the residential nil-rate band of \u00a3175,000. The latter is available to people who are passing on a main residence to a direct descendant, such as children or grandchildren, as part of their estate. Together these two allowances total \u00a3500,000.",
      "This is on top of the \u00a31m tax-free allowance for agricultural estates.",
      "It\u2019s not just the \u00a31.5m allowance for a single individual - for anyone married their spouse has a similar effective allowance. Adding these together - and allowing for the ability of farming couples to share their allowances - does create a potential for some farming estates to pass on \u00a33m entirely free of inheritance tax.",
      "However, importantly, this could only be achieved if each partner passed on \u00a31.5m of their total assets at death sequentially, rather than in one \u00a33m estate upon the death of the second partner.",
      "The ability of estates to push up the threshold to \u00a33m will also depend on individual circumstances. Of course, not every farmer is married, and some might not be passing on a main residence.",
      "However, it\u2019s legitimate to assume that many farming estates would be able to use these allowances, which are used by the rest of the population.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a farming estate can be affected by this inheritance tax change, without the estate necessarily ending up paying more money in tax, because of the need for individuals to spend more time planning their tax arrangements than they did before.",
      "Farm tax changes will not affect 'vast majority' - PM",

    "story": [
      "Energy regulator Ofgem is urging billpayers to shop around as it announced another price rise in January - the second of the winter.",
      "Someone paying by direct debit and using a typical amount of gas and electricity will pay \u00a31,738, or \u00a321 a year more, with bills now over 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",
      "Some customers could immediately save \u00a3100 a year by moving from paying their bill every three months to paying by direct debit.",
      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "The charity National Energy Action said many people were already \"rationing their energy use\" or building up debt to try to keep warm.",
      "Angela, from Liverpool, is one of those who has fallen behind on bills.",
      "As a carer for her mum, she told the BBC she was having to make tough choices.",
      "\"I\u2019m over \u00a31,000 in arrears with [my energy supplier] so I don\u2019t put the gas and electric on,\" she said. \"We just sit there with our onesies on of a night. I think it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s a disgrace.\"",
      "Close to where she was speaking is Kitty's Laundrette, a co-operative which provides cheap washing and drying for the community, as well as a free service for those who need it.",
      "Anthony Scott is part of the team running it, seeing dozens of customers every day, many of whom are struggling financially.",
      "\u201cI come across a lot of anger, I feel a lot of anger. People are being priced out of using energy in their own home,\" he said.",
      "Winter fuel payment debate",
      "The cap affects those on default, variable tariffs, not those who have fixed a price for a set period.",
      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the government to reinstate winter fuel payments to all pensioners and \"cancel the bill rise\".",
      "Some pensioner households affected in Northern Ireland will receive a one-off \u00a3100 payment.",
      "The energy market is regulated differently in Northern Ireland, and is not governed by the same price cap.",

      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",

      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",

      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",

      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",

      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

    "summary": "The popularity of McDonald and her party appears to have fallen as Ireland prepares for the election.",
    "story": [
      "Four years ago it was a question of when and not if Mary Lou McDonald would one day become Ireland's first female taoiseach.",
      "She was the most popular politician in the Republic of Ireland after steering her party to an historic election result, outpolling all her rivals and securing a record number of seats.",
      "In fact, of the 42 candidates Sinn F\u00e9in fielded, only five failed to get elected.",
      "McDonald was untouchable and even considered herself the taoiseach-in-waiting.",
      "How the tide has turned.",
      "Her popularity and that of her party has fallen dramatically, hitting rock bottom in the recent European and council elections when Sinn F\u00e9in took just 12% of the vote.",
      "In the wake of that result, questions within the party about her leadership started to bubble beneath the surface.",
      "Could Sinn F\u00e9in's biggest asset now become a liability facing into one of the most important elections in the party's history?",
      "After a summer of soul searching, Sinn F\u00e9in and its president are now trying to bounce back ahead of the poll on Friday.",
      "Mary Lou's missteps",
      "The first big mistake, by her own admission, came when McDonald sided with the government in the referendum to change the definition of the family.",
      "It was heavily defeated and Sinn F\u00e9in felt the backlash more than most.",
      "Her judgement was also questioned when she called for Garda Commissioner Drew Harris and Justice Minister Helen McEntee to resign after the Dublin riots.",
      "It was a battle she was never going to win.",
      "The party under her leadership struggled to set out a clear policy on immigration and, as a result, Sinn F\u00e9in lost support to the left and right.",
      "In recent months she has been forced to apologise for controversies involving a former party press officer and senator Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile.",
      "She has also lost two TDs along the way and, at times, has struggled under the pressure of relentless questions around her leadership.",
      "'Make or break'",
      "Irish Times political correspondent Jennifer Bray said the drop in McDonald's approval rating is a real concern for the party.",
      "\"It has fallen by 12% in the space of a year, which is not a huge amount, but enough to worry the party and place extra pressure on her during the campaign,\" she said.",
      "\"Mary Lou is a tremendous communicator which was crucial in 2020 when she managed to paint the picture of a Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael boys club trying to exclude a woman from debates.",
      "\"But this is make or break for her this time, she has to get it right and if they don't there will be big questions about her leadership again.\"",
      "The Sinn F\u00e9in president has so far performed well in the campaign debates and the polls suggest her party is moving in the right direction.",
      "With housing, health and the cost-of-living crisis dominating on the doorsteps, Sinn F\u00e9in believes it is now on solid ground.",
      "It is targeting at least 40 seats, which it believes will put the party at the heart of the post-election negotiations to form the next coalition government.",
      "'Used more sparsely'",
      "But former TD Shane Ross, who recently wrote a biography of the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, said that, unlike in 2020, the party has not framed its campaign around the Mary Lou McDonald brand.",
      "\"Sinn F\u00e9in appears to be using Mary Lou more sparsely and whenever she appears she is often flanked by her frontbench team,\" he said.",
      "\"Those like Pearse Doherty and Eoin \u00d3 Broin are more up front and at times leaving Mary Lou in the background, it is a clear tactic.\"",
      "But Sinn F\u00e9in believes it has the strongest frontbench team and is keen to let voters see the faces of its would-be ministers at every opportunity.",
      "Among them is deputy leader Doherty, who insisted McDonald remains the party's greatest asset.",
      "\"Mary Lou is the taoiseach this country needs and she is the person who will sort out health, housing, child care and the cost of living,\" he said.",
      "\"She also has the frontbench team who are ready to deliver from day one.\"",
      "Sinn F\u00e9in's campaign calling for \"change\" worked well for the party in 2020 and it has adopted the same slogan again.",
      "But if it fails to get into government this time to deliver the change it is promising, then we may see a change within its leadership ranks.",

    "summary": "Angela Rayner sought inspiration from John Prescott's rise to the near top of the Labour Party and the country.",
    "story": [
      "John Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts.",
      "He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off.",
      "His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre.",
      "He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together.",
      "It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer.",
      "Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged.",
      "Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC:  \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\"",
      "She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\"",
      "Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\".",
      "She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".",

      "And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use.",
      "Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them.",
      "And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for.",

      "Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life.",

      "If you have a moment today, I recommend listening to this wonderful documentary on BBC Sounds \u2013 Prescott At Your Service - which tells the story of a 19-year-old John Prescott working as a waiter on an ocean liner to New Zealand, where the future deputy prime minister would serve the recently resigned former prime minister Anthony Eden.",
      "Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government.",
      "\u201cHe could smell out condescension, a slight, an air of superiority or a snub at a thousand paces; and at once smelt, he could charge after it with quite shocking abandon.\u201d",
      "John Prescott was the conduit between Labour\u2019s past and its present.",
      "He was, as well, the glue binding Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose pivotal but at times dysfunctional relationship defined the first decade of Labour\u2019s stint in power between 1997 and 2010.",

      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",
      "Similarly, in the final plenary when all countries accepted the finance text, there were brash cheers when speakers from several nations spoke out against the agreement, after the gavelling.",
      "Will confrontational activism and fraught debate become the new norm at a diplomatic climate conference?",
      "We will have to wait for the next COP to see.",

    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "summary": "It is one of a number of tech firms pushing back against Australia's plan to ban social media for under-16s.",
    "story": [
      "Career-networking site LinkedIn has told Australian lawmakers it is too dull for kids to warrant its inclusion in a proposed ban on social media for under 16 year olds.",
      "\"LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors,\" the Microsoft-owned company said in a submission to an Australian senate committee.",
      "The Australian government has said it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to stop children accessing social media platforms.",
      "But companies behind some of the most popular platforms with young people - Meta, Google, Snapchat-owner Snap Inc and TikTok - have all challenged the planned law in submissions made to lawmakers.",
      "Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?",

      "Other countries are closely watching what happens with the legislation with some - including the UK - saying they are open to following suit.",
      "Australia's Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee gave respondents one day to comment on the bill, which would amend its existing Online Safety Act.",
      "Its report to the Senate concludes the bill should pass - providing its recommendations, such as engaging young people in the legislation's implementation, are considered.",
      "'Significant concerns'",
      "However, in their responses, the world's biggest tech firms have been setting out why they are unhappy with the proposed law.",
      "Google - which owns YouTube - and Instagram-parent Meta have said they needed more time to consider the legislation.",
      "Meta said its current form \"will fail to achieve its goal of reducing the burden on parents to manage the safety of young people on social media\".",
      "It also claimed it \"ignores the evidence\" presented by child safety and mental health experts - a view shared by Snapchat in its own submission.",
      "X (formerly Twitter), meanwhile questioned the legality of the bill's proposals.",
      "TikTok Australia said it had \"significant concerns\" with the bill as proposed.",
      "Like other platforms commenting on the legislation, it said it \"hinges\" on an ongoing age assurance trial looking at technologies that can effectively check user age.",
      "Ella Woods-Joyce, director of public policy for TikTok Australia and New Zealand, wrote in the company's submission that the bill's \"rushed passage poses a serious risk of further unintended consequences\".",
      "But LinkedIn has adopted a different approach - arguing in its submission that is a platform which is simply not of any interest to children.",
      "Its minimum age requirement of 16 means they cannot access it, the company said, adding it removes child accounts when found.",
      "If LinkedIn can successfully argue it should not be included in the legislation it will potentially avoid the cost and disruption involved it introducing additional age verification processes to the site.",
      "\"Subjecting LinkedIn\u2019s platform to regulation under the proposed legislation would create unnecessary barriers and costs for LinkedIn\u2019s members in Australia to undertake age assurance,\" it said.",
      "Interest elsewhere",
      "The Australian government has said it wants to bring in the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year.",
      "But experts have said the bill's timeframe and current composition fails to provide an opportunity for adequate scrutiny.",
      "Carly Kind, the country's privacy commissioner, said in a LinkedIn post on Monday after appearing at a public Senate hearing that she was concerned by \"the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban\".",
      "Human rights commissioner Lorraine Findlay called the one-day window for submissions of responses to the legislation \"entirely inadequate\" in a LinkedIn post on Thursday.",
      "\"We need actual consultation, not just the appearance of it,\" she said.",
      "Nonetheless, the Australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere.",
      "In the UK, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, told the BBC this month that similar legislation was \"on the table.\"",
      "France has already introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent- though research indicates almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN."

    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool which has been trained to tell the difference between grey and red squirrels could be \"an absolute game changer\", conservationists say.",
      "The system, called Squirrel Agent, has been trained on thousands of images of the animals allowing it to tell them apart with 97% accuracy, its developer says.",
      "It can then be used to automatically control access to squirrel feeders - with only reds being allowed into those containing food, and only greys into those where food has been replaced with contraceptive paste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real showcase of what AI can do,\u201d said Emma McClenaghan, co-founder of Genysys Engine, which developed the tool.",

      "Squirrel Agent is currently being tested in sites around the UK in conjunction with five wildlife charities.",
      "Genysys Engine hopes it will eventually be used much more widely not just with squirrels but with other species which would benefit from sophisticated digital monitoring.",
      "Ian Glendinning, from Northern Red Squirrels - one of the conservation groups involved in the trial - told the BBC that, for the animals he is trying to protect, help from technology was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWe are in the bar of the last chance saloon, and the landlord has just called last orders,\" he said.",
      "Red peril",
      "Grey squirrels are largely responsible for the huge decline in the numbers of red squirrels.",
      "This is partly because there are so many of them, and also because they can carry a  virus which they have immunity to but is lethal to red squirrels. They arrived in the UK around 200 years ago.",
      "\u201cRed squirrels are hanging on in Scotland and Ireland, and there are some island populations like Anglesey and the Isle of Wight\", explained Mr Glendinning.",
      "\"But mainland England and Wales is in dire straits, and they will become extinct if we are unable to reverse this trend.\"",
      "Efforts to preserve red squirrels are further complicated by the fact that, despite their name, not all red squirrels are red.",
      "There are other markers including their tails, ears, size and weight which can also distinguish them from grey squirrels \u2013 the vastly dominant population - even if they are the same colour.",
      "The detection process is time-consuming for human observers - but Squirrel Agent uses the power of AI to rapidly analyse all those markers and decide with an extremely high level of accuracy which is which.",
      "It can then automatically decide whether to boost their survival chances by allowing them extra food - or reduce their likelihood of reproducing by steering them towards contraceptives.",
      "By a whisker",
      "Genysys Engine says the next step in the evolution of the tech is to go beyond just distinguishing between the types of squirrel and instead identify individual animals.",
      "This will be done, Emma McClenaghan says, by focusing on their whiskers, which are unique to each animal.",
      "\"Whiskers are like a human fingerprints,\" she says.",
      "By distinguishing between each creature\u2019s whisker tips, as well as their base and length, she hopes AI will enable wildlife experts to track and monitor individual members of the population.",
      "\u201cOver time this data will build up, allowing scientists and researchers to start tracking family lines,\u201d she says.",
      "There are already other examples of AI's ability to process huge amounts of data very quickly being useful for conservationists.",

    "title": "The superpowers of coatings make possible the impossible",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "story": [
      "A US court has dismissed the last remaining federal criminal case against Donald Trump, which alleged that the president-elect illegally retained classified documents.",
      "The appeals court approved a dismissal request from Special Prosecutor Jack Smith on Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, on Monday, a separate case alleging that Trump illegally sought to overturn the 2020 election was also dismissed.",
      "Smith, who was appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland to investigate Trump, said in court filings that he requested the dismissals because the Justice Department is banned from prosecuting a sitting president, and not because of anything having to do with the substance of the cases.",
      "The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning charges could be refiled after Trump finishes his second term as president.",
      "In his request to drop the election case, Smith wrote: \"This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant.\"",

      "At the beginning of the year, he faced nearly 100 criminal charges connected to the two federal cases and others.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled this summer that a former president could not be prosecuted for \"official acts\" taken while in office, and Trump went on to win the election a few months later. Now almost all those charges have been dropped, with a case brought by prosecutors in Georgia currently on pause.",

      "\"It was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds,\" he wrote.",
      "Vice-President-elect JD Vance said the prosecutions were \"always political\".",
      "\"If Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison,\" he wrote.",
      "Trump has pledged to sack Smith as soon as he takes office in January. Smith has reportedly said he plans to step down next year.",
      "The dismissal of the cases marks an end to a lengthy legal saga.",
      "Smith had to refile the election-subversion charges against the former president based on the Supreme Court ruling that Trump was immune from some prosecution.",
      "The special counsel had argued in a revised indictment that Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results were related to his campaign and therefore not official acts.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump was accused of storing dozens of sensitive files in his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.",

      "Smith, however, appealed her decision, and the case was pending before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals before Tuesday's dismissal.",
      "The special prosecutor is continuing to pursue charges related to classified documents against two Trump employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira.  Both have also pleaded not guilty.",
      "In a filing on Tuesday, Smith said he was continuing to appeal partly to fight Judge Cannon's controversial ruling that the Attorney General did not have the legal power to appoint a special prosecutor. If he succeeds, the question may ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court.",
      "In a statement, John Irving, an attorney for Mr De Oliveira, said: \"The Special Counsel\u2019s decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place.",
      "\"Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that\u2019s fine with us,\" Mr Irving said.",

      "His sentencing for his criminal conviction in the state of New York, related to the Stormy Daniels payment, has been indefinitely delayed.",

      "Both are young adults who have been unable to find jobs.",
      "A trained dentist, Itula, 67, was himself once a Swapo stalwart but was expelled from the party in 2020 after running as an independent candidate against then-President Hage Geingob in the 2019 poll.",
      "He had also been a youth leader and spent some time in prison before going into exile in the UK in the early 1980s. He returned to Namibia in 2013.",
      "Six years later, he charismatically came crashing into the front row of Namibian politics, challenging Geingob in the presidential election after saying the Swapo process for choosing its candidate was flawed.",
      "Itula\u2019s intervention in that election led to Swapo getting its lowest ever share - 56% - in the presidential election and also losing its two-thirds majority in parliament.",
      "As someone who had a professional life outside politics, he has an appeal to the 50% of the 1.5 million voters who are under the age of 35, many of whom want economic change, a job or a measurable boost to their incomes.",
      "His bold and at times brash style, rejecting the more staid political rhetoric of Nandi-Ndaitwah, has seen him win support among business people and the growing urban intelligentsia.",
      "But while Itula is quick off the mark and eloquent, the vice-president chooses her words wisely, and speaks slowly and deliberately.",
      "Nandi-Ndaitwah seeks harmony and teamwork, emphasising community, passion and care, and as such, reaches right down to the grass roots.",
      "And as the first woman with a chance of becoming the country\u2019s president, she carries the hope of some women who want a change from the patriarchal society.",
      "However, Nandi-Ndaitwah represents the \u201ctried and trusted\u201d old school of Namibia\u2019s liberation struggle, while Itula represents the possible \u201cwind of change\u201d in a political landscape needing a facelift.",
      "According to political analyst Henning Melber, the close rivalry between the two leading candidates could mean that the presidential election will go into an unprecedented second round run-off, which is required if no-one gets more than half of the votes cast.",
      "In neighbouring South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), in power since 1994, was forced into a coalition following May\u2019s general election. While in Botswana - just to the east - the Botswana Democratic Party, dominant for nearly six decades, crashed to a humiliating defeat at the end of last month.",
      "Swapo wants to avoid the same fate.",
      "The winner on Wednesday will be the candidate who can be most trusted on issues such as youth unemployment, corruption, health care, education and infrastructure improvement, while also being able to bolster the economy.",
      "This will need to happen without having to sell off the country's vast natural resources to foreign bidders - such as off-shore gas as well as lithium and other essential metals.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:47:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Dominique Pelicot, 72, is facing the maximum sentence for rape in a case that has horrified France.",
    "story": [
      "French prosecutors have demanded a 20-year jail sentence for Dominique Pelicot, who is accused of drugging his former wife Gis\u00e8le for a decade and inviting 50 men recruited online to rape her.",
      "Mr Pelicot, who has admitted to the charges, should also undergo medical treatment for 10 years, prosecutors said.",
      "Twenty years - the maximum sentence for rape under French law - \"is both a lot... and too little given the gravity of the acts that were committed and repeated,\" said prosecutor Laure Chabaud.",
      "Referring to an assessment of Mr Pelicot made by a psychiatrist earlier in the trial, Ms Chabaud said that the defendant presented \"multiple sexual deviances\".",
      "Verdicts and sentences are expected next month.",
      "\"He sought pleasure through a desire to submit, humiliate and debase his wife - the person he claimed to cherish the most in the world,\" Ms Chabaud told the court, saying that Mr Pelicot, 72, should be re-examined at the end of his sentence before being released.",
      "Another prosecutor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayet, said the trial had shaken up society and that what is at stake \"was not a conviction or an acquittal\" but \"to fundamentally change the relations between men and women\".",
      "Mr Mayet paid tribute to the \"courage and dignity\" of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who was in court as she has been most days since the trial began in September.",
      "Her decision to waive anonymity and have an open trial has led to a huge amount of interest in the case, which has in turn sparked a nationwide conversation on rape culture, consent and chemical submission - drugging someone for the purposes of coercion or assault.",
      "On Monday morning posters reading \"20 years for everyone\" had appeared on the walls around the Avignon courthouse where the trial is taking place.",
      "However, it is unlikely the 50 defendants in this extraordinary case will be handed sentences this long.",
      "The longest jail term requested by prosecutors today - excluding the 20-year demand made for Mr Pelicot - was for Jean-Pierre Marechal, a co-defendant who is not accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, but who has admitted to drugging and raping his own ex-wife on Mr Pelicot's advice and instruction.",
      "He is facing 17 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors also demanded 10 years for most of the other 19 defendants whose cases were examined today.",
      "The majority of the 50 accused deny the charges of rape, arguing that they cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious when they were invited to the family\u2019s home by her husband, and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her.",
      "But prosecutor Ms Chabaud said that \"in 2024 we can no longer maintain that because she didn't say anything, she consented.\"",
      "She added that neither the circumstances nor the behaviour of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \"could have led these men to believe that she agreed to be subjected to these sexual acts in her lethargic state.\"",
      "Final phase for mass rape trial that has horrified France",
      "Man who drugged wife in French mass rape case told: You'll die alone",

      "\"I'm convinced that the Mazan trial will mark a before and after,\" he said.",
      "Mazan is the name of the village where the Pelicots lived and where Dominque Pelicot filmed the local men he had contacted online.",
      "The prime minister also announced a series of government measures to combat violence against women, including funding for pharmacies to dispense home drug test kits under a pilot scheme to fight chemical submission.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Equality Minister Salima Saa said the government was \u201cfully mobilised\u201d and announced the expansion of a system which allows victims of sexual violence to file complaints in hospitals and not just police stations.",
      "The system is currently used in 236 hospitals and will be extended to 377 by the end of next year.",
      "A new awareness campaign was also announced.",
      "The trial, which opened in early September, is now in its final stretch.",

After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

      "That is thanks to America\u2019s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.",
      "Here are three ways to look at his win.",
      "Trump missed majority of voters by a hair",
      "With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC\u2019s US partner, CBS News.",
      "That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.",
      "But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.",
      "This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.",
      "In 2024, Trump\u2019s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.",
      "But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.",
      "To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.",
      "For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate \"may be overwrought\", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to \"justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government\".",
      "His electoral college win was resounding",
      "On a different metric, Trump\u2019s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris\u2019s 226.",
      "And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.",
      "The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.",
      "Trump\u2019s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.",
      "And it is important to remember that the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.",
      "If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.",
      "That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.",
      "In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.",
      "But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.",
      "Republicans win House in major boost for TrumpHow America voted in maps and charts'It's simple, really' - why Latinos voted for Trump",
      "Republicans win House in major boost for Trump",
      "How America voted in maps and charts",
      "'It's simple, really' - why Latinos voted for Trump",
      "Second highest vote count - behind Biden in 2020",
      "There is another measure with which to consider Trump\u2019s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.",
      "The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.",
      "It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.",
      "That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved.",
      "Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket.",
      "Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to \"2019 prices\" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze.",
      "\"The real story is Harris\u2019s inability to mobilise people who voted for Biden in 2020,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent to lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.",
      "The selection ends what has proven to be one of the more protracted decisions for the president-elect as he assembles his team for a second term.",
      "Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.",
      "The 62-year-old's nomination on Friday evening kicked-off a series of cabinet announcements and White House appointments that leaves Trump's top team almost complete ahead of his return to the presidency in January.",
      "\"Scott is widely respected as one of the World\u2019s foremost International Investors and Geopolitical and Economic Strategists,\" Trump said in his announcement on Truth Social.",
      "\"[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,\" he said, adding that Bessent would \"support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances.\"",
      "Bessent has made it well known that he wants to extend tax cuts made in Mr Trump's first term in office.",
      "He has also defended the use of import tariffs, one of the more controversial parts of the President-elect's campaign agenda, calling them a \"useful negotiating tool\".",
      "On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a \"new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes\".",
      "A Friday flurry",
      "Trump also nominated Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for US Labor Secretary on Friday, saying she would help to \"grow wages and improve working conditions [and] bring back our manufacturing jobs\".",
      "The representative from Oregon, 56, won strong trade union support but narrowly lost her bid for re-election earlier this month, meaning her nomination will not affect the Republican majority in the House come January.",
      "He then made another cabinet nomination moments later, announcing Scott Turner as his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NFL veteran and motivational speaker previously served in the Texas House of Representatives.",
      "Trump also announced a series of senior health picks, giving his backing to Fox News contributor Dr Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General and former Florida Congressman Dr Dave Weldon as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "He selected Russell Vought as director of the US Office of Management and Budget, which helps decide policy priorities and how they should be funded.",
      "Vought, who played a role in Project 2025 - a \"wish list\" for a second Trump presidency by the conservative Heritage Foundation - held the same position during Trump's first term.",
      "The president-elect also announced White House roles for Alex Wong and Sebastian Gorka who also served during Trump's first term.",
      "How will Bessent lead US Treasury?",
      "If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term.",
      "Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Such ideas have been met with alarm in traditional economic and corporate circles.",
      "In an interview with Fox News shortly before the election, Bessent said ensuring the tax cuts do not expire as planned at the end of next year would be his top priority, if he ended up in the administration.",
      "\"If it doesn\u2019t happen, this will be the largest tax increase in US history,\" he warned.",
      "For other posts, Trump has been willing to back candidates with minimal experience in favour of loyalty and apparent conviction in his pledges.",
      "But he has appeared more hesitant to buck convention at the Treasury Department, which serves as a key liaison between the White House and Wall Street and has critical functions that include collecting taxes, supervising banks, wielding sanctions and handling US government debt.",
      "In his announcement, Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt\u201d. That issue has long been a priority for traditional Republicans, but financial markets see an increase in debt as a risk in a second Trump term.",
      "Bessent, a native of South Carolina, made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.",
      "In 2015, he started his own fund, Key Square Capital Management, which is known for making investments based on big-picture economic policy.",
      "He and his husband, a former New York City prosecutor, married in 2011 and have two children. He is known for philanthropy in South Carolina, where his family has deep roots.",
      "Bessent has defended tariffs - a capstone of Trump's protectionist agenda - arguing that opposition to them is rooted in political ideology and not \"considered economic thought\".",
      "But he has also characterised Trump\u2019s support for such border taxes as a negotiating tool, suggesting the president-elect isn\u2019t necessarily committed to aggressively raising duties.",
      "That stance makes him more moderate than others whose names were floated for the treasury role.",
      "However, Bessent has been a strong proponent of Trump\u2019s embrace of the crypto industry. Such support would make him the first treasury secretary to openly champion cryptocurrency, sending a clear signal that Trump is serious about establishing the US as the \"crypto capital of the planet\".",

      "He embraced Christianity, and, in the words of Asante historian and politician Albert Adu Boahen, \"rigidly and uncompromisingly imposed that religion on his fellow political prisoners and their children\".",
      "In the Anglican Church of St Paul\u2019s, the Asante were not the only exiles in the congregation, for they often sat with King Mwanga of Buganda and King Kabalega of Bunyoro, both from modern-day Uganda.",
      "Indeed, at various times, the British also sent political prisoners from Egypt, Palestine, Zanzibar, the Maldives, Malaysia and Cyprus to Seychelles, which was known as a \"prison without bars\", as its isolation made the perfect location, from the British point of view, to put troublesome opponents.",
      "The years went by, and Prempeh dreamt of home.",
      "In 1918, he wrote to King George V and pleaded to be allowed to return.",
      "\"Consider how wretched I am for I was being taken prisoner\u2026 for now 22 years, and now how miserable to see that father, mother, brother and nearly three quarters of the chiefs are dead. The remaining quarter, some are blind, some worn out with old age and the rest being attacked of diverse diseases,\" Prempeh wrote.",
      "A few years later, the British, perhaps aware that Prempeh\u2019s potential death in exile could bring political problems in Asante, finally relented.",
      "In November 1924 Prempeh travelled by ship  back to West Africa with some 50 Asante companions, most of whom had been born in Seychelles.",
      "\"We who do not know him are more than anxious to see his face,\" wrote a prominent local newspaper, The Gold Coast Leader.",
      "In Kumasi, many slept by the train station to greet him and, according to a British official, \"the scene presented by the huge assembly\u2026. with their white head bands signifying rejoicing or victory, some laughing and cheering, while others wept with emotion, was a most moving and never-to-be-forgotten sight\".",
      "In theory \"Mr Edward Prempeh\" was now a private citizen, but his people treated him as a king, and presented him with royal regalia, including the Golden Stool, said to contain the soul of the Asante nation.",
      "Prempeh died in 1931, and his successor, Prempeh II, was restored to the position of Asantehene in 1935.",
      "Ivor Agyeman-Duah, an Asante scholar and director of the palace museum, helped organise the centenary celebrations.",
      "They were of added personal significance, as his great grandfather, Kwame Boatin, was one of the chiefs exiled alongside Prempeh.",
      "But as Mr Agyeman-Duah acknowledges, exile, for all its pain, also brought opportunities for those who suffered it.",
      "Kwame Boatin\u2019s children went on to be ambassadors and leading civil servants, able to adapt to the dramatic changes that Asante, the Gold Coast and later an independent Ghana, underwent in the 20th Century.",
      "\"The exiles had been exposed to the world, and they had something to contribute,\" he said. \"What they brought back still inspires us, their dedication to scholarship and public service.\"",
      "In a village one hour\u2019s drive from Kumasi, I met Princess Molly Prempeh, an animated lady in her 80s, and also a great-granddaughter of Prempeh.",
      "\"I\u2019m the only remaining person here who was born in Seychelles,\" she told me.",
      "\"I\u2019m Seychellois and Ghanaian - I was five years old when I came back.\"",
      "In her old age, Molly has reconnected with the beautiful islands of her birth, and visited twice.",
      "The Seychellois are delighted by the \"Old Creole\", which includes more French words, she remembers from childhood.",
      "\"When I walk down the streets they shout 'Heh Princess, how are you?' 'Princess, venez, venez, tu bien?' (come, come here, you good?) they are lovely people. They love the Prempehs in Sesel (Seychelles).\"",
      "But Molly\u2019s visits are also tinged with sadness. She goes to the grave of her mother, Hugette, who brought Molly as a young girl to the Gold Coast in 1948.",

    "story": [
      "An independent candidate with a nationalist background has stunned Romania and alarmed its allies by coming first in the initial round of the presidential elections on Sunday.",
      "Calin Georgescu is a 62-year-old expert on sustainable development and agriculture, with no party of his own, but a background in the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) nationalist movement.",
      "His programme calls for a radical transformation of Romania, to one based on small-scale organic agriculture, Christian values, and national sovereignty. His programme has similarities to that of Robert F Kennedy Jr in the US - Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary - who has pledged to \"make America healthy again\". Some of his videos on TikTok show him bathing in icy water.",
      "Georgescu bases his own expertise on his past work in the Romanian Foreign Ministry, and in a number of think tanks and NGOs linked to the United Nations.",
      "One key to his sudden popularity is his promise to \"restore Romania\u2019s dignity\" and end subservience to the international organisations it belongs to, including Nato and the EU.",
      "The post of president in Romania is significant, with considerable influence on foreign policy. Romania has been a staunch US ally and Nato member, and hosts US Nato bases which play an important logistical role in monitoring the war in neighbouring Ukraine.",
      "Considerable Western military support for Ukraine passes through Romania, though few details are given due to national security concerns. Georgescu has criticised the US-supplied missile shield at Deveselu as \"a diplomatic embarrassment\", and questioned its defensive role  - echoing the Kremlin narrative, which describes the base as an example of Nato aggression towards Russia.",
      "\"Romania will respect its obligations towards the alliances, organisations and partnerships of which it is a member,\" reads point 13 of Georgescu\u2019s campaign programme for this election, \"to the extent that they will respect their obligations towards Romania\".",

      "Romanian village set to become Nato's biggest airbase in Europe",
      "Romania country profile",
      "In a TV interview in May 2018, he called Russian President Putin one of the few politicians in the world who is \"a true leader\". This has earned him a reputation as a pro-Russian politician, though there is little other evidence. His victory on Sunday was warmly welcomed in several Russian media, including Sputnik, Russia Today and RIA Novosti. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, remarked obliquely that \"he had never heard of him\".",
      "Other international comparisons have been made with Hungary\u2019s veteran prime minister, Viktor Orban, whom he is said to admire. The two men could find common ground, in their demand for an end to the war in Ukraine, and the importance of restoring peace in Europe.",
      "Some of his most controversial remarks concern two leaders of the Romanian Iron Guard, a fascist and mystically Christian movement in Romania between 1927 and 1944, whom he described as \"heroes\". This led to his expulsion from George Simion\u2019s AUR.",
      "Nevertheless Georgescu denies that his programme is in any way antisemitic or xenophobic.",
      "A key factor in his victory on Sunday was his adept use of social media, especially TikTok, where he has more than 330,000 followers - up from 30,000 a fortnight ago - and more than 4m likes. That translated into over two million votes in this election."

      "\u201cWhen I stepped out of my house, it felt like I was inhaling smoke,\u201d says Imran Ahmed Ali, a lawyer in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh.",
      "Pollution levels in Chandigarh - India's first planned city, located about 240km (150 miles) from capital Delhi - have been at more than 15 times the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for more than a month.",
      "It is now common for air quality in the city to dip every winter, but Mr Ali says he has never felt so sick before.",
      "A few weeks ago, the 31-year-old began experiencing a dry cough and shortness of breath, which he initially dismissed as symptoms of a seasonal cold. But as the temperature dropped, his chest congestion worsened and he went to a doctor.",
      "\u201cAfter running several tests, the doctor told me that my symptoms were caused by pollution. I\u2019m now taking medicine twice a day to manage my breathing,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Ali is among hundreds of millions of people living in northern India who are forced to breathe toxic polluted air for extended periods every winter.",
      "According to Swiss firm IQAir, eight of the 10 most polluted cities in the world last year were located in the Indo-Gangetic plains - a densely populated region which stretches across northern and eastern India, along with parts of Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "A recent report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago reiterates that the northern plains - home to 540.7 million people across Bihar, Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal - is the most polluted region in India. When compared with the WHO's standards, air pollution at current levels could reduce the life expectancy of people here by 5.4 years, it adds.",
      "But as the toxic smog closes in every winter, headlines and attention are mostly focused on Delhi.",
      "Delhi receives significant attention due to its position as the capital of India, says Parthaa Bosu, strategic adviser at the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit group focused on delivering climate solutions.",
      "Every year, the Delhi government implements an annual action plan, which includes measures such as driving restrictions and a ban on construction activities during peak pollution periods.",
      "Even though there is criticism that this isn't enough, most other places in northern India have not seen such proactive steps.",
      "Mr Bosu says that often, people don't associate other parts of northern India - particularly villages and small towns and cities - with high pollution.",
      "\"In [people's] minds, villages are clean, green and pristine - but that\u2019s far from the reality,\" he says.",
      "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
      "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
      "Pollution in the region is not caused by a single factor, but a combination of elements - such as construction activities, vehicular emissions, industrial pollutants and the seasonal burning of crop residue.",
      "While many of these factors are present throughout the year, the difference in the winter months - from October to January - is the weather conditions.",
      "The air quality worsens each winter because cold stagnant air traps pollutants near the ground, making it harder for them to disperse, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.",
      "The landlocked geography of the Indo-Gangetic Plain worsens the situation. The region is surrounded by mountains and lacks strong winds, which normally help blow polluted air away.",
      "Doctors and health experts warn of the risks of breathing in these pollutants.",
      "\"Patients complain of a burning sensation in their eyes and throat when they step outside. Some face difficulty in breathing,\" says Dr Rajesh Gupta, director of the pulmonary department at Fortis Hospital in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh state.",
      "Dr Gupta says that people who are otherwise healthy also develop respiratory troubles this time of the year, and that children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.",
      "The bleak conditions also exact a mental toll. Aditi Garg, who works in Meerut town - about 100km from Delhi - used to cherish the quiet moments on her balcony each morning.",
      "That routine has been disrupted completely.",
      "Since mid-October, pollution levels in Meerut have remained at levels classified as \"poor\" or \"severe\", making it difficult to breathe.",
      "Ms Garg now spends nearly all her time indoors, next to her air purifier, trying to shield herself from the toxic air outside.",
      "\"I don't have an option but to stay inside, this is the best I can do,\" she says.",
      "And not everyone has the privilege of staying indoors.",
      "In Uttar Pradesh alone, more than 83 million people are registered as employees in the unorganised sector. The actual number is likely to be much higher.",
      "This includes daily wage workers, street vendors and agricultural labourers who have no choice but to work outdoors, risking their health.",
      "Standing outside his shanty in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kanpur city, Mohammad Salim Siddiqui gasps for breath as he speaks.",
      "An automobile spare parts vendor and the sole breadwinner of his family, Mr Siddiqui has to brave the pollution every day.",
      "\"Two members of my family are struggling with respiratory problems because of the pollution,\" says Mr Siddiqui, adding that it's particularly bad in crowded slums.",
      "\"We need help,\" he says.",
      "Over the years, governments in some states have made efforts to counter the pollution problem.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) with an aim to reduce particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5, tiny particles that can enter the lungs and cause diseases) levels by 20-30% by 2026 as compared to 2017 levels.",
      "The goal was later updated to reduce PM10 levels up to 40% by 2026.",
      "Under this programme, 131 Indian cities - including many in the Indo-Gangetic Plains - were to develop tailored plans to address local pollution sources.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:30:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Faced with a housing and homelessness crisis, Halifax has set aside city sites for people to live in tents. Not everyone is behind the plan.",
    "story": [
      "As cities across North America grapple with homelessness, one Canadian city has taken a different approach by regulating tent encampments instead of banning them, as it tries to tackle what one official calls the issue \"of the decade\".",
      "Andrew Goodsell has called his small orange tent on a grassy patch in downtown Halifax home for almost a year.",
      "In late October, on a park bench outside his makeshift dwelling, the 38-year-old described life at the homeless encampment where he lives with about a dozen or so others as \u201cdepressing\u201d.",
      "\u201cI wake up in an area I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Mr Goodsell said, as a stream of cars drove by.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d much rather wake up in a spot where I could take a shower and maybe make myself something to eat. But I\u2019ll still get myself out of bed.\u201d",
      "Mr Goodsell has been without a home on-and-off for a decade.",
      "He once got by with couch surfing or working minimum-wage jobs to pay rent, but with Halifax\u2019s skyrocketing housing costs, he can no longer afford a place to live.",
      "His encampment is one of nine sites chosen by the city as a place where people without housing can lawfully camp outside. The sites were approved this summer as a temporary, but some argue necessary, solution while indoor shelters are at-capacity.",
      "The policy has been adopted by at least one other municipality in Canada and is being considered by others who too are facing a rise in homelessness.",
      "It's in stark contrast to other North American cities where police officers forcibly remove homeless encampments. These so-called \"street sweeps\" have been criticised as violent and ineffective in addressing the housing crisis.",
      "But they have become increasingly popular as homelessness has grown since the pandemic. California has cleared more than 12,000 encampments since 2021, while cities like Fresno, California and Grants Pass, Oregon have passed complete bans on camping in public spaces.",
      "Proponents of banning encampments say that the campsites lead to disorder, and that funding should go to getting people off the streets.",
      "Among detractors of Halifax's approach are some encampment residents themselves, who say they want resources spent on affordable housing instead.",
      "\u201cCanada is one of the richest, most beautiful countries around,\u201d Mr Goodsell said. \u201cWe have so much land, so much resource, but we must be one of the greediest countries out there.\u201d",
      "Although several Canadian cities, including Halifax, have tried to remove homeless encampments in the past, recent court decisions in British Columbia and Ontario have ruled that people without homes can camp outside if there are no appropriate indoor shelters available.",
      "In contrast, the US Supreme Court ruled in June that cities can fine and arrest homeless people, even if there is no shelter for them to go to, paving the way for the outright bans on encampments in California and Oregon.",
      "Another difference is the growing recognition in Canada that previous approaches have failed, says Stepan Wood, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, who has studied the issue.",
      "\u201cThe approach up until a couple years ago had been to clear them out, but it\u2019s now no longer deniable that that doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Canada's national database estimates that there are 235,000 homeless people across the country in a given year, though experts argue that number is higher.",
      "This figure puts the rate of homelessness in Canada above that of the US and England, according to a comparison of official data. Globally, many cities have seen a rise in homelessness since the pandemic.",
      "In 2018, Halifax - the largest city on Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast with a population of around 518,000 - only had 18 people sleeping rough, said Max Chauvin, the director of housing and homelessness in Halifax. Now it's over 200.",
      "While Halifax has approved nine designated encampment sites, only five are operating. Each has a proposed limit of up to a dozen tents, but most are over capacity.",
      "The city provides the sites with portable toilets, while outreach workers come by weekly to drop off bottled water and check in on people, encampment residents told the BBC.",
      "Sometimes they will bring things that residents need, like a coat, or a warmer sleeping bag for the winter.",
      "Mr Chauvin said the designated encampments are born out of a realisation that the city has run out of options to immediately address its housing crisis.",
      "The city is waiting for the provincial government to ramp up affordable housing construction. Nova Scotia has not built any new public housing units since 1995.",
      "In the meantime, \u201cthe question becomes: 'Where are people going to go?'\u201d Mr Chauvin said.",
      "He believes solving the housing crisis will be \u201cthe item of the decade\u201d for his city and others.",
      "\u201cOne of the largest groups of homelessness we see growing is simply people who don't have enough money to pay rent, and that\u2019s new,\u201d he said, adding that includes seniors, students, and entire families.",
      "Mr Chauvin also points to a lack of accessible healthcare for people with mental and physical illnesses.",
      "Proponents of the designated sites say they prevent the criminalisation of people who are homeless and allow the city to concentrate its outreach services.",
      "Still, Halifax's policy is both provisional and divisive.",
      "It was a focal point of the city\u2019s October mayoral election, where the winner promised to end the expansion of designated encampments and to remove unlawful ones.",
      "Trish Purdy, a city councillor, unsuccessfully fought to remove a proposed designated site in her district, after hearing from constituents who feared it would bring crime and drug use.",
      "She acknowledged that the issue is socially and morally complex, but said she believes allowing people to live in \u201chorrible conditions\u201d is not \u201cempathetic or compassionate\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure the residents who live by any of the encampments could tell you they didn\u2019t receive any empathy or compassion when the encampments were placed on their doorstep,\u201d Ms Purdy told the BBC.",
      "One such encampment in Dartmouth, a Halifax suburb, sits adjacent to a row of public housing units, where residents complain of needle debris, violence and disputes with those living at the site.",
      "\u201cThis used to be a fun field where the kids can come out and play baseball or kickball,\u201d said Clarissa, a mother of three who declined to give her last name.",
      "\u201cNow we can\u2019t even do that, because we\u2019re too worried about stepping on a needle.\u201d",
      "Clarissa said she and her neighbours were not consulted about the encampment  and believes the site was chosen because their neighbourhood is low-income.",
      "But Ames Mathers, who lives near another encampment, called its residents her neighbours.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really messed up that people are having to live in parks at all as an only option for housing,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a housing crisis, and our province and city are dropping the ball.\u201d",
      "Some encampment residents told the BBC they welcomed knowing they wouldn't be asked to leave at a moment's notice. But many said they themselves didn't always feel safe at the sites.",
      "They also question the government's willingness to find them housing, saying they have received more help from volunteers than officials. They note that multiple high-rise condominiums are under development in Halifax - none of which, they say, are affordable.",
      "\u201cWe would like to be treated like people,\u201d said Samantha Nickerson, who lived with her fiance, Trent Smith, at the same encampment as Mr Goodsell.",
      "\u201cSome of us really are trying hard to get our lives back together and work.\u201d",
      "Ms Nickerson and Mr Smith, who are in their 30s, said they faced violence from other residents and were often verbally harassed by members of the public.",

      "He said he has not been offered indoor shelter and does not want to be uprooted to another encampment.",
      "He has outfitted his tent for the coming harsh Canadian winter as he waits for news.",

    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",
      "UWI hopes to introduce other sargassum-based innovations too, such as pest control products.",
      "Ms Spencer says it\u2019s been \"heart-warming\u201d to witness the results of the team\u2019s research.",
      "\u201cJust seeing the actual potential is motivating me to keep working,\u201d she adds.",
      "As for Brittney, five years after her eureka moment, she says she\u2019s still \u201cpinching\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cTo see the car in action was mind-blowing,\u201d she grins. \u201cI would encourage all young scientists to press ahead with their ideas. You never know when you might make the next big discovery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of work, plenty of grit and pushing against walls to reach this point,\u201d Dr Henry concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of UWI innovation and is exportable to the wider world, because it\u2019s not just the Caribbean that\u2019s affected; sargassum also impacts parts of West Africa, South America and Florida.",

    "story": [
      "Rapper Drake's company Frozen Moments filed a petition in a New York court Monday accusing the streaming service Spotify and Universal Music Group of conspiring to inflate the streams of Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer. Frozen Moments, described in the filing as \"an entity wholly owned by Drake,\" alleges that UMG \"launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\" with \"Not Like Us\" via bots and pay-for-play agreements.",
      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service. The petition also alleges UMG used bots to drive up the streams on \"Not Like Us,\" paid radio promoters to increase air play and even paid tech giant Apple to have its voice assistant Siri misdirect users to Lamar's hit song.",
      "A spokesperson for UMG called the allegations \"offensive and untrue.\"",
      "\"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, a publicist for Drake Tuesday had no comment. Spotify, Apple and representatives for Lamar did not immediately respond to CBS News requests for comment.",
      "According to the Associated Press, Drake on Tuesday filed a second legal action against UMG, but in Texas, also over \"Not Like Us.\" According to the AP, Tuesday's filing in Bexar County accuses UMG of engaging in \"irregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \"Not Like Us,\" including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia.",

They mistaken, 'cause Google saying Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense. Who filling up the piggy bank? Who bringing home the bacon?\" The line seems to indicate Drake's perceived importance to the label as Spotify's second most streamed artist behind Taylor Swift, whose Big Machine Records is also distributed by UMG.",
      "According to the petition, UMG terminated certain employees perceived as being loyal to Drake during the inter-label feud with Lamar, and rebuffed his attempts at negotiation, insisting that Drake take it up with Lamar directly instead of the label.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 09:15:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Chuck Woolery was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 08:24:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Barbara Taylor Bradford\u200b was one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

      "Nowadays, what makes a martini a martini? Robert Simonson, who wrote a book about the martini, said, \"It's funny: it's strict and loose at the same time.\"",

    "summary": "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant,\" has died at age 83.",
    "story": [
      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

    "story": [
      "The original Gladiator debuted nearly 25 years ago, winning five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Now, director Ridley Scott is returning to ancient Rome with the long-awaited sequel, \"Gladiator II\" which hits theaters Friday.",
      "The film stars Denzel Washington,\u00a0\u00a0Connie Nielsen, and Pedro Pascal in a story set in the same brutal Roman Empire \u2014one that didn't leave Scott's mind in the years since its first release.",
      "\"Well, since 'Gladiator' one, I made 17 big movies. I was quite busy,\" Scott said.",
      "But he admitted, \"During that time, I kept thinking, well, we should be doing 'Gladiator II.'\"",
      "A new hero in the arena",
      "Scott brings a fresh take on the same empire fans loved in the first movie.",
      "In the original film, Russell Crowe played Maximus, a general-turned-gladiator battling for honor. This time, the spotlight is on Irish actor Paul Mescal, who stars as a slave fighting for his freedom in the same empire.",
      "Scott, who studied art before becoming a filmmaker, started crafting the sequel's storyboards before the script was even complete.",
      "\"I'm already thinking \u2026 images. I'm drawing as [the writer] is writing. So when I enter on the set, I've already pre-planned everything,\" Scott said. \"It's very efficient because we did 'Gladiator' in 51 days.\"",
      "The sequel opens with an ambitious attack scene involving three full-scale Roman ships.",
      "\"I'm going to make three full-scale real ships,\" Scott said, explaining how they were mounted on massive industrial movers. \"Each trolley is about 100 feet long.\"",
      "While Scott embraces old-school filmmaking, he's also excited about modern tools like CGI.",
      "While Gladiator II features thrilling battles, Scott says the film also explores timeless themes and reflects on the constants of human nature, cruelty and violence.",
      "\"It reminds you that Rome would have Christians walked into that arena and eaten alive. Men, women, and children\u2014for fun,\" he said. \"What on earth was in the minds of Romans in that particular point? And have we come very far away from that? It's extraordinary that's still happening. We don't learn by history.\"",
      "The challenge of a sequel",
      "At 86, Scott admitted it was daunting to follow up on his original masterpiece. \"In a funny kind of way, I feel like I'm in a sport. It is competitive,\" he said. \"You're fighting yourself and your own fear and your own insecurity.\"",
      "When asked about his favorite part of the movie, Scott said, \"I think I'm relieved it is so embraced. And so I'm the favorite as the whole movie. It's pretty good.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:14:18 -0500",
    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:40:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

    "title": "Here's why Trump thinks tariffs are good for the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said Tuesday that personal electronics could become more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his threat to slap new tariffs on foreign goods, as large retailers scramble to assess the potential impact of the proposed levies on their business.",
      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\" she added.",
      "Price hikes are not guaranteed, Barry cautioned, saying that any impact on the retailer's costs and prices are contingent on how any new tariffs might be implemented.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a very fluid situation as we continue to work through it,\" she said, adding that the company will \"make sure we do everything we can to keep prices right for our customers.\"",
      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call. Roughly 60% of the goods Best Buy sells are imported from China.",
      "\"We are already planning for and working with our vendor partners on next steps,\" she said.",

      "Walmart's decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies nationwide is designed to \"ensure every customer, every associate\" feels welcome and like they belong, according to John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S.",
      "\"Like many companies all across the United States, we've been on a journey and we continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",
      "Furner said Walmart is undergoing the changes to help foster inclusion.",
      "\"We're going to continue to make the best decisions we can that makes everyone \u2013 our customers, our associates \u2013 feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Walmart's decision comes amid growing pressure from conservatives to halt corporate DEI policies, which ramped up after the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023\u00a0ending affirmative action in college admissions. Some conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace DEI initiatives as well as hiring practices that give boosts to historically marginalized groups.",
      "Other corporations that have recently backed away from DEI policies include\u00a0Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson.",
      "When asked if diversity among suppliers remains important to Walmart, Furner turned the focus to small businesses and small suppliers.",
      "\"We'll continue to do the things we can do to ensure small suppliers have a path to be successful,\" he said, noting that Walmart started in 1962 as a single store in Rogers, Arkansas.",
      "Walmart is also committed to selling American-made goods, which make up about two-thirds of what the company sells, Furner said, adding, \"We're going to continue to lean into ensuring that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, our supplies to be successful here in the store.\"",
      "How Walmart's preparing for Trump's proposed tariffs",
      "Walmart will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump's new trade policies, as the retailer's products are mostly made within the U.S., Furner said. Even so, he acknowledged customers may see some impact on prices.",

      "The cost burden of paying for child care can exceed a typical family's annual housing costs, and even cost more than in-state tuition at public universities, other research has found.",
      "In some U.S. states, child care expenses are consuming\u00a0more than a quarter of an average household's total income, with a typical family spending $700 a month on the service, Bank of America found in a 2023 report.",

      "While consuming a large chunk of many families' income, child care workers are generally poorly paid. As of May 2023, wages averaged $15.42 an hour, or just over $32,000 a year, according\u00a0to\u00a0federal data. Overall, the nation's child care workforce is among the lowest 5% paid of all occupations, noted Haspel.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic worsened an existing\u00a0shortage of child care workers\u00a0as thousands left the industry in favor of higher-paid work.

      "Trump made the announcements on his Truth Social site Monday evening as he railed against an influx of illegal migrants.",
      "CBS News also reported Monday that unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month.",
      "Trump also turned his ire on China, saying he has \"had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail.\"",

Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a rule the Biden administration has proposed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",

      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts.

      "Microsoft is investigating an issue with its Microsoft 365 service and its Teams app, with some users reporting to\u00a0DownDetector that they are having problems using services such as Exchange and Outlook.",
      "On social media service X, Microsoft posted a message\u00a0early Monday that it is assessing \"an issue impacting users attempting to access Exchange Online or functionality within Microsoft Teams calendar.\" The problem appears to be affecting Microsoft users globally, according to posts from users.",
      "\"We've identified a recent change which we believe has resulted in impact. We've started to revert the change and are investigating what additional actions are required to mitigate the issue,\" Microsoft added in a subsequent post.",
      "Microsoft 365 is a subscription-based app that packages services like Word and Excel, while also providing cloud-based storage, while Teams is primarily used by workplaces for video calls and online chat. Although DownDetector, an online service that tracks tech outages, only had a few dozen reports of problems with 365 as of early Monday morning, users posted on social media that they were experiencing issues with the Microsoft services.",
      "University of Galway \"is aware of an issue impacting some Microsoft 365 services, including Outlook, Outlook Calendars, Teams etc,\" noted the Irish university's IT group on X. \"This is an intermittent issue impacting Microsoft 365 customers globally. Microsoft is aware & investigating.\"",
      "When did the outage begin?",
      "Reports of outages began at about 4 a.m. Eastern Time, according to DownDetector. By 10 a.m., there were about 2,000 reports from people saying they were having problems with Microsoft 365, the outage detection service said.",

      "The disruption, which led to thousands of flights and train services being canceled globally, spawned a number lawsuits, with Delta Air Lines suing\u00a0CrowdStrike and Microsoft over the outage, which took down the airline's internal systems and caused\u00a0chaos\u00a0for travelers.",
      "Is Outlook down?",
      "Some users reported problems with Microsoft Outlook, including trouble connecting to the service as well as sending emails, according to DownDetector.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 07:54:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza \u2014 also known as bird flu \u2014 is killing layer hens and reducing the nation's egg supply.",
    "story": [
      "Americans planning to do some holiday baking this year may have to scramble to track down a key ingredient.",
      "Some stores around the U.S. are running short of eggs, especially those operating in states that require eggs from cage-free hens, as cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) flare and the virus spreads from wild birds to commercial flocks. More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1, had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Bernt\u00a0Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",
      "Added Metz, \"There is a hen for almost every person in the U.S., if they are not in the supermarket today, come back tomorrow.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:01:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most Americans are forced to retire earlier than they had expected, often disrupting their financial planning.",
    "story": [
      "The typical American retires far earlier than he or she expects to, and it's often not by choice, according to new research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",
      "The median retirement age in the U.S. is 62, with nearly six in 10 retirees telling the research firm that they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned. Almost half of those people said the reason came down to health issues, such as physical limitations or disability. Losing a job or an organizational change at their employer were among the other reasons people stopped working before they planned to retire.",
      "\"Financially precarious\"",
      "The findings underscore the fragility of retirement in the U.S., with older Americans often finding themselves retired before they're financially ready to call it quits. And with many people outliving earlier generations \u2014 the typical respondent told Transamerica they believe they'll live to age 90 \u2014 they're also facing the prospect of supporting themselves financially for several decades in retirement, which can easily stretch or even exhaust their savings.",
      "\"Many of them are financially precarious \u2014 if they were to have some sort of major financial shock or their health would decline and needed long-term care, they would have a hard time affording it,\" Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The research backs up previous research about the typical retirement age, with the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute finding earlier this year that the median retirement age for Americans is 62. That underscores a gap between retirement plans and reality, with business leaders and policy experts often urging Americans to work longer so they can save more for their old age \u2014 a strategy that often doesn't unfold as envisioned.",
      "Retirees forced to leave their jobs earlier than planned is a \"cautionary tale for people currently in the workforce,\" Collinson said.",
      "People should actively maintain their health and keep their skills up to date, while also educating themselves about retirement and financial planning, as well as socking away savings, she noted.",
      "Why Americans claim Social Security early",
      "Retiring before a person expects may explain why millions of Americans claim Social Security before they reach their \"full retirement age,\" or the age at which they are entitled to their full benefits.",
      "Retirement experts generally urge Americans to hold off on claiming Social Security as long as possible because of the financial benefits of waiting. Workers can file for the retirement benefit as early as age 62, but the tradeoff is a roughly 30%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in their monthly checks compared with waiting until full retirement age, which is either 66 or 67 depending on one's birth year.",
      "But the median age when Americans claim Social Security benefits is 63, Transamerica found in its survey of more than 2,400 retirees. That means many older Americans are locking themselves into permanently lower monthly checks throughout their retirement.",
      "On the flip side, waiting until age 70 to collect Social Security \u2014 the maximum age to claim benefits \u2014 provides a boost of more than 30% to one's monthly benefits. Despite that incentive, Transamerica found that only 4% of retirees wait until 70 to file for their benefits.",
      "\"One of the most important things they can do is fully understand their benefits, and if they have any options to stretch out those benefits,\" Collinson said. \"If it's a spousal situation, maybe if they need the income, one claims first and the other later, or if they can jump back in the workforce and hit the pause button on Social Security and get more income.\"",
      "Another reason for claiming Social Security early is likely that many retirees may not have enough money put away in a retirement fund to keep them afloat. Only about half of U.S. retirees participated in a 401(k) or similar plan throughout their working careers, while more than one in four said their employer never offered retirement benefits while they worked, Transamerica found.",
      "About 6 in 10 retirees cited Social Security as their primary source of income, underscoring the importance of the program for older Americans. By comparison, only about 1 in 10 said retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs would be their main source of income.",
      "Challenged but happy",
      "Despite the challenges, many retirees are sanguine about stepping back from work, the study found. Almost 9 in 10 described themselves as being generally happy and having close relationships with family and friends.",
      "\"One of the things that stands out is retirees are really enjoying their time in retirement, which I think bodes well for all of us,\" Collinson said. \"They've made some adjustments, especially to their financial situation, and overall they are doing well.\"",
      "Americans \"dream of retirement,\" she added. \"Retirement is more about freedom and the ability to spend their time as they want to, rather than it is financial freedom specifically.\"",

      "To put AI to the test, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave used\u00a0Google's Gemini bot\u00a0to explore travel options, while CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen, herself a seasoned traveler, relied on more conventional online tools to compare deals across flights, hotels and activities. Here's what they found.",
      "Which approach saved time and money?",
      "For the sake of comparison, both Van Cleave and Chen set out to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, but they went about planning the trip in different ways.",
      "Using Google's Gemini AI app, Van Cleave spent under a minute on his mobile phone to generate a potential itinerary. For her part, Chen spent about 45 minutes comparing deals and reviews across websites including Expedia, Kayak and Tripadvisor.",
      "The upshot? He saved time, while the total cost of a flight and three nights at a five-star hotel came out to $741.48, compared to $780.05 for the same itinerary rustled up by Chen.",
      "\"I think he won this round, and I really need a vacation now,\" Chen said.",
      "Communication breakdown",
      "Yet while Gemini found some savings, it fell short once the pair was on the ground, and Van Cleave tasked it with creating an itinerary of free activities and events.",
      "\"I am on my way, letting AI guide my day,\" Van Cleave said. The technology directed him to visit the Bellagio Resort & Casino, where it suggested he visit a free botanical garden. But that information appeared to be outdated.",
      "\"What it didn't tell me \u2014 they seasonally tear it down for a holiday display,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Chen, guided by her own internet research, visited the Pinball Hall of Fame, which was open and which displayed hundreds of pinball machines, including vintage games from 1953.",
      "AI also fell short for Van Cleave when it told him that morning fountain shows at the Bellagio are less crowded than those that take place in the afternoon.",
      "\"The reason the morning fountain shows are less crowded is because there are no morning fountain shows,\" Van Cleave said. \"They don't start until three.\"",
      "Van Cleave was misdirected yet again when he arrived at what he expected to be the Mirage, a casino resort, for a volcano show. In its place was a construction site where a new Hard Rock Cafe has yet to open.",
      "More successfully, AI steered Van Cleave to Vegas' art district on Fremont Street, and booked a dinner reservation that was to the correspondents' liking.",
      "To err is human",
      "Not that Chen's search was foolproof. She visited the Stratosphere Tower, the tallest observation tower in the U.S., in hopes of scoring a free ride to its top floor drinks lounge. There was just one hitch.",
      "\"I thought it would be free to go up to the drinks lounge...but turns out it charged admission as well,\" she said.",

Users are also instructed to give the AI feedback when it provides a faulty recommendation in order to improve the product for other travelers.",
      "Indeed, major travel service providers seem confident that \"generative AI,\" which functions by creating text, videos and other content based on existing data, is here to stay.

      "Macy's reported preliminary third-quarter results Monday, with net sales decreasing 2.4% to $4.7 billion. Macy's comparable sales were down 2.4% in company-owned stores, excluding cosmetics. Bloomingdale's comparable sales rose 1%, while Bluemercury's comparable sales rose 3.3%.",
      "It expects to report full third-quarter financial results by Dec. 11. Macy's shares fell 51 cents, or 3%, to $15.79 in morning trade.",
      "Macy's in February said it planned to\u00a0close 150 stores\u00a0and lay off more than 2,000 workers amid a pullback in consumer spending. The retailer this summer ended acquisition talks with two investment firms that had jointly bid $6.9 billion to buy Macy's.",

    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "story": [
      "It's well-documented that women in the workplace often face biases when seeking leadership roles, but new research is uncovering just how pervasive and wide-ranging those prejudices can be.",
      "In the working world, women leaders report experiencing 30 types of identity factors that discriminate on everything from their body size to marital status, according to new\u00a0research from Wilson College chief information officer Amy Diehl, Westmont College dean Leanne Dzubinski and Clarkson University professor Amber Stephenson published in the peer-reviewed Human Resource Development Quarterly.",
      "The findings stem from the trio's 2023 research into age discrimination. That work, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that women in the workplace\u00a0face bias\u00a0regardless of their age, with their superiors often viewing them as too inexperienced if they are young and too unworthy of promotion if they are older. The new study surveyed more than 900 women in leadership roles in four industries where women comprise a large share of the workforce \u2014 health care, higher education, law and faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"Surprised and shocked\"",
      "\"The way we phrased the question was, 'Tell us about any other identity factors that are impacting your experience'\" in the workforce, Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We thought there would be age and race. We were surprised and shocked when we looked through the data and came up with 30.\"",
      "It's telling that the factors focus on personal qualities like class, marital status and sexual orientation, rather than professional qualifications or skills, underscoring that these biases aren't relevant to whether a woman can perform in the workplace, the researchers said.",
      "\"There is always an excuse masquerading as a reason given for a women about why she's not quite right for any role,\" noted Dzubinski.",

      "Stumbling on the broken rung",
      "While the new research focuses on women in their 40s and 50s who have already reached leadership roles, younger women are more likely to be held back by the so-called broken rung, or when women fail to get a promotion out of entry-level jobs at the same rate as men, research from consulting firm McKinsey and LeanIn, the nonprofit started by former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, has found.",
      "Their research found bias may play a role in stunting women's careers, with young men often promoted on their potential while young women are judged more on their track records.",
      "The new research on bias encountered by women in leadership roles didn't examine how women coped with bias as they climbed the professional ladder, although Diehl noted that women who rise into senior positions tend to \"have a thick skin,\" and might use techniques such as diverting conversations away from identity issues when they arise.",
      "Bias from other women",
      "The researchers focused on four industries where workers are either split equally between men and women or are female-dominated, although the top leadership positions in all these fields are typically held by men. The goal, in short, was also to examine the impact of gender bias in industries not dominated by men.",
      "The women leaders who responded to the survey were college presidents, vice presidents and provosts within higher education; physicians and physician administrators in health care; lawyers and partners within the legal field; and women who hold top leadership roles in faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"If you have women well represented in the industry, we're still seeing that women are still experiencing various types of bias,\" Stephenson said. \"It's a very real and very embedded situation within any workplace\" regardless of gender composition.",
      "Dzubinski added, \"It used to be the argument that as soon as you get more women in, it would fix itself \u2014 it's not fixing itself.\"",
      "Women can internalize bias and express it against other women in their workplace, while some might believe that there's not enough room at the top for more than a few women, the researchers noted. That can lead to the belief the only way to ascend into leadership roles is if another woman loses her spot, they said.",
      "Can you combat workplace bias?",
      "It's difficult for women to fight such biases, given that others may judge women negatively regardless of their situation, such as whether they are married or unmarried, both of which can trigger prejudices, the research noted.",
      "\"Notice that they are contradictions \u2014 if you are married, that's a problem, or if you aren't married that's a problem,\" Dzubinski told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you put them together you see that they are made up excuses\" to justify why women don't deserve promotions.",
      "While difficult, women should try not to take identity-based criticism personally, Diehl said.",
      "\"It feels very much, 'It's about me,' but it really isn't. It's about larger, systematic gender bias that's trying to force them out of the workplace or into supporting roles, and not leadership roles,\" she said.",
      "Organizations can deal with some of these issues by going over their practices and checking whether these identity factors are playing a role in whether people receive or are denied promotions, the researchers said. Another tool is to use a \"flip it\" strategy, applying the same statement about a woman to a man, such as \"John can't take on this role because he just had a child',\" they noted.",
      "With an onling push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from conservative lawmakers, some companies are dropping their investment in DEI. That could pick up speed under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he'll do more to remove these policies in his next term, while Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's handbook for the next conservative White House, proposes removing all federal rules and programs around DEI.",
      "But rooting out bias can help organizations perform better, the researchers noted.",
      "\"When woman after woman is dealing with all this stuff day after day, it takes time away from them doing their actual job,\" Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hurting the organization in terms of the amount of quality work they can get to.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court issued its first opinion of the term, a one-line decision dismissing Facebook's appeal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court order reviving a shareholder lawsuit brought against the social media giant in light of consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's 2015 misuse of millions of Facebook users' data.",
      "In its first opinion of the term, the high court issued a one-line unsigned decision dismissing Facebook's appeal. The court's ruling indicates it believes it should not have taken up the case, though the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning.",
      "In tossing the appeal, the Supreme Court leaves in place a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in favor of Facebook shareholders. They had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Facebook for allegedly misleading them in financial filings about the risks stemming from the massive data breach by Cambridge Analytica.",
      "The case involved what information publicly traded companies must disclose in the \"risk factors\" section of their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, whether they're obligated to share risks that materialized in the past, even if those events don't present ongoing or future business harm.",
      "The dispute stems from a class action lawsuit that arose out of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica had purchased data collected through a personality quiz on Facebook and used it to create psychological profiles of U.S. voters to assist GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:30:07 -0500",
    "summary": "While some are bullish, other experts warn of investment risks as what comes next is impossible to know.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",
      "Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000 and investors do not appear to be fazed by gravity or any cautionary tales of the cryptocurrencies history of volatility.",
      "Cryptocurrencies and related investments like crypto exchange traded funds have rallied because the incoming Trump administration is expected to be more \"crypto-friendly\" than the outgoing Biden administration.",
      "As of 11:02 a.m. ET, bitcoin traded at $96,747 after rising as high as $98,349 according to CoinDesk.",
      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Cryptocurrency is making lots of noise, literally",
      "Cryptocurrency is making lots of noise, literally",

      "But Weiss \u2014 the Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. attorney who was kept on during the Biden administration and later elevated to the role of special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to continue the Hunter Biden probes \u2014 alleged in a February 2024 indictment that Smirnov illegally made false claims to FBI handlers about Hunter and Mr. Biden that dated back to 2020.",
      "Smirnov was accused of lying to investigators when he told them the two Bidens had each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",

      "On Nov. 21, just weeks before he was set to go to trial on Dec. 3, federal prosecutors in Weiss' office filed a little-noticed indictment in a separate case against Smirnov, alleging he had illegally concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in income between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Court records alleged Smirnov spent unreported income on a Las Vegas apartment, a Bentley and payments on credit card debt. Prosecutors did not name the alleged source of the funds, but the dates and amounts of his payments to him from a single company identified in their filing as \"Company 1\" coincide with payments they alleged Smirnov received from the Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation, which was named in court records filed in Smirnov's other case. The new charges do not indicate any wrongdoing by Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation. Other income came from an unnamed individual, the new indictment said.",

    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal appeals court to dismiss his appeal in the documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 A federal appeals court on Tuesday granted special counsel Jack Smith's bid to end the case against President-elect Donald Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents, effectively bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented case against the nation's former and next president.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit said in a brief order that it had granted Smith's request to dismiss the appeal as to Trump. The special counsel had asked the Atlanta-based court on Monday to drop his effort to revive\u00a0the case, citing Trump's recent victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election and longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The district court judge presiding over Trump's case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, had ruled earlier this year that the charges should be dismissed because Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision, but asked the 11th Circuit to dismiss his appeal.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law,\" Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement in response to Smith's request. \"The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "In his brief filing\u00a0with the 11th Circuit, Smith cited a separate request to dismiss his other case involving Trump, which involves an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel said in that filing submitted to a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case agreed to drop the charges against Trump just hours after Smith filed his request, marking the culmination of that monthslong prosecution against the president-elect. In the documents case, dismissing the appeal as to Trump leaves in place the lower court's order tossing out the charges against him. The appeal will continue as to Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, because unlike the president-elect, \"no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" Smith wrote.",
      "\"The special counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,\" John Irving, de Oliveira's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment.",
      "Trump became the first former president to face federal charges when a grand jury returned an indictment against him in June 2023. The prosecution came months after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search of Trump's South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 and recovered more than 100 documents marked classified that he kept after his first term ended in January 2021.",
      "Following the search, Trump mounted a separate legal battle that brought the appointment of an independent arbiter to sift through the material seized by the FBI, though the 11th Circuit ordered an end to that review in late 2022.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November of that year to take over the federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records and pursued charges against the president-elect for unlawfully retaining national defense information and attempting to obstruct the Justice Department's probe. Trump was charged alongside two employees, Nauta, an aide, and de Oliveira, the property manager as Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Trump, Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect claimed his prosecution was a politically motivated attempt to harm his candidacy in the race for a second term.",
      "Prosecutors used court filings to reveal information about how Trump allegedly stored records containing the nation's secrets at his resort, as well as how he, with his co-defendants, allegedly engaged in a scheme to deceive federal investigators and stymie their probe.",
      "They included photos showing boxes of material stacked on the stage in Mar-a-Lago's ballroom and in a bathroom on the property. Other images taken by the FBI during its August 2022 search show boxes of records in a storage room and in Trump's office, some of which prosecutors said contained highly sensitive information alongside personal keepsakes and other items from his presidency.",
      "Cannon initially set a trial date for May 20, 2024, but she postponed the proceedings weeks before they were set to begin.",
      "The president-elect and his lawyers attempted to have the case against him dismissed on a variety of grounds, claiming he was selectively prosecuted, he was shielded from federal charges by presidential immunity and Smith was appointed in violation of the Constitution.",
      "Trump succeeded in persuading Cannon that the special counsel's appointment and funding for his office were unlawful, and she ordered the case to be dismissed in July.",
      "But Smith appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit. Both he and Trump's lawyers submitted filings with the court presenting their views on Cannon's ruling, though the court had not yet set a date for arguments. It was expected that an eventual decision from the 11th Circuit would wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "The documents case was one of two that Smith brought against Trump. In Washington, he faced charges related to an alleged attempt to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. The president-elect pleaded not guilty to the four counts he faced there, and the dispute landed before the Supreme Court as Trump argued presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",
      "He was also charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed.",
      "The Fulton County case involved an alleged plot by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. He pleaded not guilty to charges in the sprawling racketeering case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis. Proceedings had been halted, though, while a state appeals court considered whether Willis should be disqualified from the case. It's unclear how Trump's victory will affect his prosecution in Fulton County.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, Smith has sought to end both of the historic prosecutions of the former and next president.",
      "With both cases settled, Smith is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland has pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so for Smith's report, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress after submitting their reports, and Smith could as well.",
      "Should the disclosure of Smith's findings stall and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its release become increasingly slim as the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",

      "Homan and Abbott served meals to Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers who are stationed at Eagle Pass and Edinburg over Thanksgiving, Abbott's office said. They are stationed there as part of Operation Lone Star, a border mission Abbott launched in March 2021 \u2014 alleging insufficient support from the Biden administration to combat the flow of immigration along the Texas-Mexico border.",
      "Abbott has touted the border mission \u2014 which deployed thousands of police and soldiers and miles of barriers \u2014 as a success, despite testimony before a GOP-led Texas Senate panel earlier this year about low morale among troops, humanitarian concerns and ballooning costs. Additionally, the Biden Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union have sued Texas, arguing the law interferes with the federal government's authority over immigration.",
      "Homan on Tuesday vowed to \"help Abbott finish the job he started\" when Trump takes office.",

    "summary": "Millions of Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a rule the Biden administration has proposed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:42:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while.

    "story": [
      "Married couples across the U.S. have had access to no-fault divorce for more than 50 years, an option many call crucial to supporting domestic abuse victims and key to preventing already crowded family courts from drowning in complicated divorce proceedings.",
      "But some advocates for women worried as old comments from now Vice President-elect JD Vance circulated during the presidential campaign opposing no-fault divorce. And after President-elect Donald Trump and Vance won the election, warnings began popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still could. Some attorneys posted saying they were seeing a spike in calls from women seeking divorce consultations.",
      "Trump - who is twice-divorced - hasn't championed overhauling the country's divorce laws, but in 2021 Vance lamented that divorce is too easily accessible. Conservative podcasters and others have, as well.",
      "\"We've run this experiment in real time and what we have is a lot of very, very real family dysfunction that's making our kids unhappy,\" Vance said during a speech  at a Christian high school in California, where he criticized people being able to \"shift spouses like they change their underwear.\"",
      "Despite concerns, even those who want to make divorces harder to get say they don't expect big, swift changes. There is no national coordinated effort underway. And states determine their own divorce laws, so national leaders can't change policy.",
      "\"Even in some of the so-called red states, it hasn't gotten anywhere,\" said Beverly Willett, co-chair of the Coalition for Divorce Reform, whose group has unsuccessfully attempted to get states to repeal their no-fault divorce laws.",
      "Mark A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Washington, said that while many Americans have become accustomed to no-fault divorce being an option, Vance's previous comments on making it more difficult to separate from a spouse could help jumpstart that effort.",
      "\"Even though he's not directly proposing a policy, it's a topic that hasn't gotten a ton of discussion in the last 15 years,\" Smith said. \"And so to have a national profile politician talk that way is noteworthy.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Party platforms in Texas and Nebraska were amended in 2022 to call for the removal of no-fault divorce. Louisiana's Republican Party considered something similar earlier this year but ultimately declined to do so.",
      "A handful of proposals have been introduced in conservative-led statehouses over the years, but all immediately stalled after they were filed.",
      "In January, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers introduced legislation that would have kept married couples from filing for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility. Deevers backed the bill after writing a piece declaring no-fault divorce was an \"abolition of marital obligation.\"",
      "Similarly, in South Carolina, two Republican lawmakers in 2023 filed a bill that would have required both spouses to file for a no-fault divorce application rather than just one. And in South Dakota, a Republican lawmaker has attempted to remove irreconcilable difference as grounds for divorce since 2020.",
      "None of the sponsors of these bills responded to interview requests from The Associated Press. All are members of their state's conservative Freedom Caucus.",
      "Alarms sounded",
      "Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers say they remain worried about the future of no-fault divorce. They point to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 as an example of a long-accepted option that was revoked through a decades-long effort.",
      "\"When you choose to be silent, you allow for this to creep in,\" said Democratic South Dakota Rep. Linda Duba. \"These are the bills that gain a foothold because you choose to be silent.\"",
      "Before California became the first state to adopt a no-fault divorce option in 1969, married couples had to prove their spouse had violated one of the approved \"faults\" outlined in their state's divorce law or risk a judge denying their divorce, said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Qualified reasons varied from state to state, but largely included infidelity, incarceration or abandonment.",
      "The system was a particular burden on domestic violence victims, often times women, who could be stuck in dangerous marriages while trying to prove their partner's abuse in court through expensive and lengthy legal proceedings.",
      "\"(Even) if there was any evidence that the couple both wanted to get divorced, that was supposed to be denied because divorce was not something you got because you wanted it, it was something you got because you've been wronged in a way that the state thought was significant,\" Grossman said.",
      "\"Extremely worried\"",
      "To date, every state in the U.S. has adopted a no-fault divorce option. However, 33 states still have a list of approved \"faults\" to file as grounds for divorce - ranging from adultery to felony conviction. In 17 states, married people only have the option of choosing no-fault divorce to end their marriages.",
      "Calls to reform no-fault divorce have remained fairly silent until the late 1990s, when concern pushed by former President George Bush's administration over the country's divorce rate sparked a brief movement for states to adopt \"covenant marriages.\" The option didn't replace a state's no-fault divorce law, but provided an option for couples that carried counseling requirements and strict exceptions for divorce.",
      "Louisiana was the first state to embrace covenant marriage options, but the effort largely stopped after Arizona and Arkansas followed suit.",
      "Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, said she is \"extremely worried\" about the possibility of no-fault divorce being removed with the incoming Trump administration, Republican-controlled Congress and wide range of conservative state leaders.",
      "\"With so many states focusing on a misogynistic legislative agenda, this will turn back the clocks on women's rights even more,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"This is why removing 'no fault' divorce is another way for the government to control women, their bodies, and their lives. Eliminating no-fault divorce is also a backdoor way of eliminating gay marriage, since this implies that a marriage is only between a man and a woman.\"",
      "With Trump's reelection, Willett, whose group opposes no-fault divorce, said she's cautiously optimistic that the political tide could change.",
      "\"Was what he said an indication of things to come? I don't know,\" Willett said. \"It's a good thing but it's certainly not anything that has been really discussed other than a few high profile conservatives who talk about it.\""

    "title": "Judge dismisses charges against Trump in D.C. election case after Smith request",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:22:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge to toss out the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the case stemming from the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump agreed to dismiss the charges following a request from special counsel Jack Smith, bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented prosecution of the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's request just hours after he said in a filing that he is seeking to close Trump's case because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"After careful consideration, the department has determined that [the Office of Legal Counsel's] prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" Smith wrote\u00a0in his filing. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\"",
      "The special counsel noted the historic nature of Trump's prosecution and subsequent election to the presidency, writing that the \"department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president.\"",
      "But after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the special counsel said \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith said in his six-page motion that he conferred with Trump's lawyers, and they did not object to the request to drop the case. The special counse sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029.",
      "Chutkan said in a brief opinion that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" in part because it is \"consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\"",
      "In response to Smith's request to drop the charges, Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement, \"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "The judge's approval of Smith's request to dismiss the case and toss the four federal counts against the president-elect was expected. The special counsel is also likely to submit a final report to the attorney general and resign before Trump takes office. Smith's request was not a surprise, as he and the Justice Department were in talks about how to wind down the prosecution after Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month. The special counsel consulted with Attorney General Merrick Garland about the decision to drop the case.",
      "Smith was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after Trump announced his third run for the White House. He took over two ongoing federal probes into Trump's conduct, one focused on his alleged mishandling of classified records and the other tied to the 2020 election.",
      "After a monthslong grand jury investigation, Smith obtained a four-count indictment against Trump that alleged he sought to resist the peaceful transfer of power following Joe Biden's electoral victory and allegedly engaged in a criminal scheme in the process. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment laid out a sprawling scheme in which prosecutors accused Trump and his unnamed co-conspirators of working to undermine the legitimacy of the election results and halt the certification of the Electoral College votes in a bid to stay in power.",
      "Trump's legal team successfully delayed the case well into this year after they claimed Trump was immune from prosecution because he was president at the time the alleged conduct took place. Chutkan and a D.C. appeals court panel rejected the argument of presidential immunity. The case was put on hold as the Supreme Court then took up the matter.",
      "Ultimately, the high court issued a landmark decision in the case, ruling in July that presidents are immune from federal criminal prosecution for actions taken in their official capacity as president of the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts allowed for charges to be filed when a president acted in an unofficial or personal capacity.",
      "Some of the alleged conduct included in Smith's 2023 indictment was disqualified from the case and the special counsel later secured a superseding indictment against Trump in an attempt to contour the charges to the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump pleaded not guilty to the new indictment earlier in September.",
      "Before Smith asked her to dismiss the case, Chutkan was in the midst of applying the Supreme Court's immunity decision to the case. In October, she made public a key filing from Smith that provided a comprehensive look at the evidence prosecutors amassed in their case against Trump. The special counsel and his team said that when he lost the 2020 race, Trump \"resorted to crimes\" to hold onto power.",
      "The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the results of the 2020 election well before Election Day and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol, where Congress had convened to tally state electoral votes. A mob of Trump's supporters breached the building, leading to the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Smith's filing to dismiss the charges.",
      "\"I'd refer you to the Department of Justice, and I would just underline that the president is proud to have restored the independence of the Department of Justice when it comes to critical matters \u2014 criminal matters,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.",
      "The special counsel made a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where judges were considering whether Smith's other case against Trump \u2014 dealing with classified documents \u2014 should be revived after a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith was unlawfully appointed to the role of special counsel by Garland and as a result, the case against Trump was invalid. The Justice Department appealed her ruling.",
      "In addition to the two federal cases, Trump was charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed following the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him in the sprawling racketeering case in Fulton County, which is related to an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, with both of Smith's cases closer to being settled, he is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so in the Smith cases, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress about their reports, and Smith could, as well.",
      "Should the public release of Smith's report stall for any reason and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its disclosure become increasingly slim, since the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and other matters in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",
      "He has also selected D. John Sauer to serve as solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court. Sauer argued the immunity case on behalf of Trump in April.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 23:21:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans vying for jobs allege Trump transition aide Boris Epshteyn has been mixing private consulting with his transition role.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is grappling with internal strife over the alleged conduct of a senior and longtime adviser, Boris Epshteyn, who has been accused by at least one Republican politician of trying to profit personally from his ability to influence Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens submitted a sworn declaration to the transition team alleging that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with an internal investigation that is being conducted by David Warrington, who served as general counsel to the Trump campaign. According to Parlatore, Warrington interviewed Greitens about his interaction with Epshteyn late last week and then asked Greitens to submit the declaration. Warrington has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"It was important to me to protect the president because I was concerned about the ethics of what was happening,\" Greitens told CBS News. \"Very specifically, I was concerned that there was an offer to advance a nomination in return for financial payments.\"",
      "Epshteyn told CBS News he is \"honored to work for President Trump and with his team.\"",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue,\u00a0as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",
      "Epshteyn has been a near-constant figure by Trump's side in recent years, buoying him on air and helping to coordinate his multiple legal teams behind closed doors. Those teams have had unquestionable success, impeding Trump's two federal criminal cases before they could get to trial, and stymying a state case against Trump in Georgia. Trump was convicted in the one case that went to trial, in New York, but recently the sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely. On Monday, special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal district court to dismiss the charges against Trump stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and he also sought to end his bid to revive the case against Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.",
      "A native of Russia who emigrated to New Jersey with his family when he was 11, Epshteyn was brought into the Trump sphere by Georgetown University classmate Eric Trump. He started as a low-level staffer during Trump's first run for office and was able to parlay that into a junior position on the White House communications team. Two months later he abruptly resigned over circumstances that remain unclear, but by then he had managed to win over Trump as his loyal confidant and fixer.",
      "Eric Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview that \"I've known Boris for years, and I've never known him to be anything but a good human being.\" But he implied the allegations could have consequences for Epshteyn.",
      "\"I certainly hope the reporting is false and I can also tell you if it's true, you know, the person will probably no longer be around,\" Eric Trump said.",
      "Epshteyn supporters praise his ability to execute orders and resolve problems, which they attribute to a frenetic energy, his bulldog personality and a cunning understanding of the political dynamics of Trump's advisers. Epshteyn has become so close to Trump that the president-elect jokingly refers to Epshteyn as \"my psychiatrist,\" The New York Times first noted. According to multiple sources, Epshteyn's access to Trump is at times only rivaled by family members.",
      "In the weeks since Trump won his second term as president, Epshteyn has been a mainstay in discussions about filling out the Cabinet. The New York Times reported Epshteyn played a critical role in recommending former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, a bid that ultimately failed to win favor and was withdrawn.",
      "The status of Epshteyn's consulting business while assisting in the transition is unclear. But prior to the 2024 election, the business appeared to be robust. A review of publicly available records indicate his firm has been paid more than $1 million from Trump's campaigns and aligned PACs since 2020, and another $1.2 million by other campaigns.",
      "While there is nothing new about political consultants \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 using their connections, interviews with about two dozen advisers, lawyers and allies of Trump reveal Epshteyn's political consulting work has bred both praise and resentment.",
      "CBS News spoke with more than half a dozen Republican candidates who have engaged with Epshteyn. Many described his pitch, offering an array of services, including \"strategic advice\" on messaging and boosting a candidate's social media presence. But nearly everyone interviewed said his access to Trump had allure.",
      "Ahead in the polls as his Republican Senate primary approached in 2022, Don Bolduc wanted to make sure Trump didn't play spoiler by endorsing one of his New Hampshire rivals. Bolduc said he turned to Epshteyn \"to run interference inside the Trump circle.\"",
      "A service like that doesn't come cheap. \"I thought $100,000 was a lot of money for what we were asking, but that's what was paid,\" said Bolduc, who added \"no guarantee\" was given by Epshteyn that Trump wouldn't endorse a rival.",
      "Bolduc won his primary after Trump stayed neutral. He told CBS News that while it appeared to him that he got what he paid for, the experience left him feeling disillusioned with the transactional side of elections. After the campaign ended in general election defeat, Bolduc said he chose to leave politics for good.",
      "\"There's nothing honorable about politics,\" said Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. After his failed Senate race, Bolduc enrolled in a police academy and became a rookie small-town cop at age 60.",
      "After publication, Rick Wiley, a senior adviser on Bolduc's campaign, told CBS News that Epshteyn \"was retained by General Bolduc's campaign for strategic media consulting with conservative media outlets, and he delivered.\"",
      "Wiley listed three shows that Bolduc appeared on and said they enabled \"his campaign to reach supporters and voters throughout New Hampshire and across the country.\"",
      "Among those who hired Epshteyn for his campaign services in the past was Greitens, who served as Missouri governor during a portion of the first Trump term. In the weeks since Trump won reelection, Greitens said he contacted Epshteyn for assistance to be considered for an appointment as U.S. Navy secretary.",
      "\"During the conversation, despite the absence of an explicit offer, Mr. Epshteyn's comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in a subsequent discussion,\" Greitens wrote. \"He stated that there would be 'time for that later' and that it was 'not time for that yet.'\"",
      "\"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President,\" Greitens wrote. \"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump, who ran on mass deportation and harsher immigration policies, could inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month. The agency has been averaging roughly 1,550 apprehensions between legal border entry points each day so far in November, according to the internal data.",
      "While U.S. officials had been worried about a spike in migrant crossings after President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election, due to his promises to seal the southern border, that has not materialized \u2014 at least not yet. In fact, illegal border crossings dropped slightly after Election Day.",
      "If the trend holds, illegal border crossings in November will be below the 54,000 apprehensions logged by Border Patrol in September, the current Biden-era low. The last time illegal border crossings were lower was in the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced migration.",
      "Spikes in migrants journeying to the U.S. border have bedeviled Republican and Democratic presidents alike. But migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under Mr. Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December. The Trump-era monthly high was 133,000 in May 2019.",
      "The current four-year-low in illegal immigration reflects a broader decrease that began earlier this year and that has been mainly attributed to efforts by the Mexican government to stop migrants from reaching American soil and asylum restrictions enacted by President Biden in June.",
      "That stringent asylum policy has dramatically cut the number of migrants released into the U.S. and allowed to apply for legal protection, government statistics show.",
      "Trump has vowed to enact even stricter measures, promising to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history and dismantle Biden administration programs that allow certain migrants to enter the country legally. Under one of those policies, the U.S. is currently processing about 40,000 migrants each month at official border crossings after they secure appointments through a smartphone app.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas argued the Biden administration built a new border policy \"model\" that both enforces U.S. law and adheres to the country's values.",
      "\"Through tough measures at our border, newly-built capabilities to remove people more quickly, the construction of lawful pathways that enable people to obtain relief in a safe and orderly way, and an unprecedented attack on the smuggling organizations, we have driven border encounters below their 2019 level, made the border more secure than it was then, and upheld our standing as a country of refuge for those who qualify under the law,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The \"ultimate irony\"",
      "Trump made the situation at the border under Mr. Biden central to his campaign, and his hardline immigration proposals resonated with many voters. Mass deportation, for example, continues to enjoy support from a majority of Americans, CBS News polling shows. But Trump could very well inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
      "\"It is an ultimate irony, and it is going to put Trump in a position of declaring victory,\" said Doris Meissner, who led the now-defunct Immigration Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration and currently serves as a senior fellow at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.",
      "The lull at the border, should it persist, could allow the incoming Trump administration to focus limited immigration enforcement resources in the interior of the country, to carry out the president-elect's mass deportation plan, which faces formidable logistical hurdles.",
      "With roughly 6,000 law enforcement officers and 41,000 detention beds, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch currently lacks the manpower and resources to arrest, detain and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants Trump and his allies have promised to expel from the country.",
      "Trump's top advisers have floated proposals to tap into the Department of Defense's vast resources, including by using military planes for deportations and tasking National Guard soldiers with carrying out immigration arrests. But the feasibility \u2014 and legality \u2014 of those plans remain open questions.",
      "Meissner said the relative calm at the southern border could allow Trump's administration to redirect Border Patrol resources towards interior immigration enforcement. But she warned that the lull in illegal border crossings could be disrupted if Mexican enforcement eases or if programs that discourage migrants from crossing the border illegally by offering them a legal path to enter the U.S. are terminated.",
      "\"There is a formula right now that even though it's fragile, is working,\" Meissner said. \"The Trump administration is very disruptor oriented, and it could actually find itself having more of a problem than is now the case at the border.\"",

    "summary": "Biden said four years of Trump would become an \"aberrant moment in time.\" Now his presidency is wedged between his rival's time in power.",
    "story": [
      "Lloyd Doggett wishes he had called on President Biden to step aside far earlier.",
      "The Texan was at the forefront of what helped lead to a dramatic change in this year's presidential election when he urged Mr. Biden to end his reelection bid in July, becoming the first Democrat in Congress to\u00a0publicly break\u00a0with the commander-in-chief after a disastrous summer debate performance against Donald Trump.",
      "In the weeks that followed more than 30 Democrats called on the president to exit the contest, but Mr. Biden's eventual decision to leave the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris failed to stop Trump from winning back the White House, the outcome many in the party feared would come to pass if Mr. Biden had remained at the top of the ticket.",
      "This is the season of second guessing on the left, a time of what-ifs and maybes. Doggett, 78, believes almost everyone holding elected office in his party bears \"some responsibility for the catastrophic defeat\" he says they were handed. In addition to losing the presidency and the Senate, Democrats also failed to take back control of the House from Republicans.",
      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Doggett said. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back and doing all the damage that he will do to our country.\"",
      "Mr. Biden ran for the White House four years ago in an attempt to end Trumpism, touting his wisdom as an experienced political hand who had spent decades in the U.S. Senate and service for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. He'll soon leave office at the age of 82, with his White House tenure wedged between Trump's first and second terms as president and a Republican-led Congress riled by Mr. Biden's tenure leading the nation.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter is going to be very happy now that he wasn't the worst president of my lifetime,\" Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez gloated. \"\u2026.[Biden's] policies got pretty soundly defeated in this last election.\"",
      "As Democrats sort through the aftermath of what went wrong, among those in Congress who helped push him out of the 2024 race, there remains respect for what Biden accomplished.",
      "\"For where America was going at the time, he saved our democracy, at least for four years,\" Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley said.",
      "But hindsight has also brought about the belief that acting sooner might have made a difference.",
      "\"[Harris] ran a pretty good campaign, actually a really good campaign, and she had the disadvantages of not having the time to distance herself from Biden,\" California Rep. Scott Peters said. \"Every campaign you make mistakes. And because she had such a compressed time frame, she didn't really have time to recover from the mistakes. But I thought it was certainly better than the alternative. I think if the president had been on the ticket, it would've just been a slaughter.\"",
      "Back in 2019, Biden said he believed history would look back on four years of President Trump \"and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.\" His campaign carried the implicit hope for Democrats that while Trump may have changed politics for the time being, defeating him would bring back a measure of civility in a nation that increasingly appeared to have long moved past wanting such courtesy.",
      "Now, Trump has found his way back to the White House after trying to overturn his loss in 2020 and spreading falsehoods that the election was stolen, claims that stirred the mob of his supporters who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021 and scarred the normally peaceful transfer of power. He overcame indictments and a group of younger Republican primary challengers. He survived two assassination attempts and won a clear victory this fall, becoming the first man in over a century to be elected to non-consecutive terms as president.",
      "In this last election, many voters sided with a far different vision for America than the one espoused by Mr. Biden. Trump's approach is far more combative, his agenda centered around undocumented immigration and a vow to conduct mass deportations along with moves enticing the far right, like potential pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. He's also promised tariffs and tax changes targeted at Americans' economic concerns.",
      "Before July, Democratic leaders publicly shook off concerns about Mr. Biden's age and ability to win again, choosing instead to overhaul the party's primary process at his own urging, paving the way for him to face little resistance about his decision to run for reelection until after his fateful debate performance.",
      "In his lone White House term, Biden led the nation out of the coronavirus pandemic and worked with Democrats' narrow congressional majorities at the time to pass a $1.9 trillion relief proposal during his first 100 days in office, relying on that same power more than a year later to put in place a landmark plan to fight climate change, both being party-line initiatives praised by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.",
      "He signed into law major bipartisan bills on infrastructure, gun safety and domestic production of semiconductor computer chips. He helped bolster support for Ukraine as it faces Russia's brutal invasion, work that may soon be undercut given that notable Trump administration picks either haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "But inflation troubles drowned out other aspects of Mr. Biden's economic record while the border, immigration, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan were key issues that Biden's presidency struggled with as he asked Democrats to get behind him for another term.",
      "\"Look, there's going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters after the election. \"Very proud of what he's been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed for what the vice president was able to do.\"",
      "A source familiar with the president's standing at the time said internal campaign polling \"showed a slight hit\" from the June 27 debate and contended that \"it wasn't until the circular firing squad picked up and there was regular coverage of Democrats calling for an exit that we really took more damage.\"",
      "Yet among the Democrats who called on him to leave the race before Mr. Biden dropped out on July 21, there is a sense that they were right, that they did what needed to be done even if it didn't get them where they wanted to be.",
      "\"In retrospect, I feel certain that Biden was facing certain defeat and that we were certainly going to see the loss of the House and the Senate, and I felt the House would be much worse than it is now,\" said California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who still regards Biden as having had an \"amazing run as the president.\"",
      "Others didn't share the same introspection.",
      "Even after going public with his call for Biden to end his campaign, Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his own contest, a defeat which helped give Republicans the Senate and unified control of Washington. Reeling from his loss and facing reporters as he hurried through the Capitol a few days after the election, Brown said \"I don't have any thoughts on Biden's legacy.\"",
      "\"I'm just focused on what we need to do here these last few weeks,\" Brown said. \"I'm not a pundit.\"",
      "And the man who defeated Brown didn't hesitate to credit Mr. Biden for helping bring Trump back to power.",
      "\"Biden was the greatest thing to ever happen to President Trump because he showed the country how insane the left has gotten,\" said Bernie Moreno, the Republican who ousted Brown from his Senate seat.",
      "Mr. Biden isn't quite an afterthought in Washington \u2014 however, the spotlight that was so squarely trained on him for most of the last four years has drifted to Trump and the vision his allies on the right have for the president-elect's return to power.",
      "In these waning days of his presidency, Mr. Biden isn't the only one quietly finishing his tenure. Political life in the nation's Capitol rarely ends in climactic fashion, with most leaving the halls of power because of retirement or defeat rather than one final victory before calling it a career.",
      "Like Mr. Biden, Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is a former party standard bearer. And like the president, his political career is coming to an end as a man they both opposed prepares to retake the White House, that \"aberrant moment\" Mr. Biden once described returning for an encore.",
      "\"President Biden is a good and fine man,\" Romney said. \"But I think he badly misread the American public.\"",

    "story": [
      "By phone from her office, just steps from Main Street, the mayor of Brevard, North Carolina, shared the pain of the local businesses down the street.",
      "For example, the hand-crafted gift shop called \"Local Color\" is accustomed to thousands of dollars in sales during an average weekend, Mayor Maureen Copelof said. But during one weekend after Hurricane Helene, \"All they sold was one bar of soap.\"",
      "The nearby seafood restaurant was so inundated with water from the hurricane floods, Copelof said the owner initially told her, \"I'm not even sure if I should try to rebuild.\"",
      "Brevard was among the dozens of North Carolina communities devastated by Hurricane Helene. But the crisis has morphed in October and November, into a painful and uncertain wait for federal aid that seems to have stalled.",
      "\"These businesses and these home owners are desperate and I am worried,\" Copelof told CBS News.\u00a0 \"October is our biggest month for tourism, and sales were down 50 to 75%.\"",
      "Helene ransacked western North Carolina on Sept. 27, leaving a path of devastation, death and an economic calamity from which the state will need years to recover.",
      "A standoff in Congress has indefinitely delayed efforts to replenish the U.S. Small Business Administration's disaster loan fund, which offers emergency loans to help homeowners and businesses rebuild damaged properties.\u00a0 The loans are also used to help upgrade homes and businesses to prevent against future storm damage.\u00a0 The money can also be used to help offset the loss of sales during business closures.",
      "Despite warnings from the Biden administration that the federal fund for the loans would be fully exhausted by October, Congress departed Washington before Election Day without passing legislation to replenish the fund. And upon its return from its recess last week, the Senate held a hearing to discuss plans for future funding of the loan program. But no legislation has been drafted, nor has a date been set to vote on any measure to restore the money.",
      "\"There's always a concern about Congress moving sluggishly,\" Sen. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican, told CBS News, \"But I'm talking to my colleagues in the Senate to make sure this emergency funding goes through and that it is spent appropriately.\"",
      "When asked how soon the funding will be needed for the communities impacted by Hurricane Helene, Budd responded, \"It was needed yesterday.\"",
      "\"These aren't just numbers on paper, it's real money.\u00a0 It's our livelihoods,\" said Mike Hawkins, who owns the Pisgah Fish Camp restaurant in Brevard, North Carolina.\u00a0 The building was damaged so severely that it can't be occupied.",
      "Hawkins has shuttered the business until at least January or February. The restaurant suffered nearly $300,000 in damaged equipment, including its refrigeration units and fryers, which is a uniquely painful loss for a restaurant that's partly famous for its onion rings.",
      "\"Small businesses have such little margin for error,\" Hawkins told CBS News.",
      "In the meantime, the backlog of applications for emergency loans has skyrocketed in recent weeks, according to a CBS News review.\u00a0 A federal official said 12,000 disaster loans have been prepared for approval and funding, totaling approximately $1 billion in help. The Small Business Administration is also processing an additional 60,000 applications nationwide, as the impasse over funding in Congress continues.",
      "A Congressional aide told CBS News approximately 40% of the pending applications are in North Carolina.",
      "The loan applications have been submitted by disaster victims, including homeowners and small businesses, in communities nationwide. Victims of hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other emergencies have sought aid, but Congressional aides told CBS News the historic and widespread devastation from Hurricane Helene has dramatically increased the number of victims who have sought the loans.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who chaired a hearing last week on the crisis, said \"this is one of the longest times in my memory that we have gone without Congress providing disaster funding. That is unacceptable. It is well past time we get aid out to the many people in need, after the many disasters we have faced over the past two years.\"",
      "In testimony to the Senate panel, U.S. Small Business administrator Isabel Guzman said the agency \"provides support for those who don't have insurance or are underinsured.\"",
      "\"With delays, this further impacts them,\" she added.",
      "In North Carolina alone, the damage from Helene is sweeping and historic in scope. A report from Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said at least 151,000 homes and 500,000 small businesses suffered damage.",
      "\"We are now 54 days past Helene's initial impact,\" Tillis said. \"Many in the mainstream media and outside world may have moved on and returned to business as usual, but for my constituents in Western North Carolina: Life is now measured in the time before and after Hurricane Helene.\"",
      "Due to Washington's inaction, some of the communities who are awaiting the emergency loans are launching local fundraisers to offer temporary help to impacted businesses.\tIn Brevard, the popular local band Steep Canyon Rangers staged a fundraising concert along the city's main street on a late October evening.\tIn folding chairs, crowds blanketed the street.",
      "Tickets were free, and attendees were asked to donate to a charity formed to help fund the storm-impacted community members.",
      "The Transylvania County, North Carolina, fundraiser for needy businesses has raised $200,000 to help bridge the gap until the Small Business Administration loans are finally funded and dispersed by the federal government.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, said Sunday that the upcoming months will be \"really critical\" in determining the \"next phase\" of the war in Ukraine as the president-elect is expected to work to force a negotiated settlement when he enters office.",
      "McMaster, a CBS News contributor, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Russia and Ukraine are both incentivized to make \"as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in\" as the two countries seek leverage in negotiations.",
      "With an eye toward strengthening Ukraine's standing before President-elect Donald Trump returns to office in the new year, the Biden administration agreed in recent days to provide anti-personnel land mines for use, while lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made longer range missiles to strike within Russian territory. The moves come as Ukraine marked more than 1,000 days since Russia's invasion in February 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, many of Trump's key selection for top posts in his administration \u2014 Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Sens. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and JD Vance for Vice President \u2014 haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine, or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "McMaster said the dynamic is \"a real problem\" and delivers a \"psychological blow to the Ukrainians.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts, and it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail,\" he said. \"And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.\"",
      "McMaster said he's hopeful that Trump's picks, and the president-elect himself, will \"begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.\" He cited the North Korean soldiers fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II, the efforts China is taking to \"sustain Russia's war-making machine,\" and the drones and missiles Iran has provided as part of the broader picture.",
      "\"So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world,\" McMaster said.",
      "On Trump's selections for top national security and defense posts, McMaster stressed the importance of the Senate's advice and consent role in making sure \"the best people are in those positions.\"",
      "McMaster outlined that based on his experience, Trump listens to advice and learns from those around him. And he argued that the nominees for director of national intelligence and defense secretary should be asked key questions like how they will \"reconcile peace through strength,\" and what they think \"motivates, drives and constrains\" Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "Meanwhile, when asked about Trump's recent selection of Sebastian Gorka as senior director for counterterrorism and deputy assistant to the president, McMaster said he doesn't think Gorka is a good person to advise the president-elect on national security.

      "The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40 percent say the U.S. military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard, and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I'm 100 percent supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people.",
      "Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say all-points bulletin, all in, but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",
      "And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, if he's going to resist that, it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.",
      "And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",

      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",
      "So it's about, are they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",

      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War with Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House.",
      "Good morning, and welcome back.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER (Retired, Former White House National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you.",
      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The 2024 election was historic for several reasons. Among them, the first openly transgender person was elected to the United States Congress. She joins us now from the state she will be representing, Delaware. Democratic Representative-elect Sarah McBride.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Thank you for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting given how polarized, how angry and divided this country is that people choose to serve and to run. You told my colleague, Scott MacFarlane, that it was your personal experience as a caregiver for your husband during his bout with terminal cancer that inspired you to run. Do you expect that health care policy will be the focus of your work here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I certainly am glad to be back here in Delaware after two weeks of orientation and to have the privilege of serving the state that I love in Congress.",
      "I ran to bring down costs facing workers, retirees, and their families. That means bringing down the cost of health care, but also housing and childcare and everyday expenses like gas and groceries.",
      "I did run for office after my experience as a caregiver to my husband, Andy, during his battle with cancer. And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",
      "And I ran for office because I do not believe that in the wealthiest, most developed nation on earth, that that time and that ability to get care should be a matter of luck. I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Paid leave is something that Mr. Trump has - has paid lip service to. We'll see in the new Congress if it comes up.",
      "We see in our CBS polling that 86 percent of voters feel congressional Democrats should find common ground with Mr. Trump and Republicans.",
      "Do you feel you can?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I said throughout this campaign that I will work with anyone who's willing to work with me to help Delawareans, to lower cost facing my constituents. There are opportunities for us to find common ground. But it's also clear that this administration, as it begins to fill its appointments with Project 2025 authors, that a lot of the policies that this president will pursue will likely hurt my constituents and raise prices.",
      "And so, where I need to fight back, I will. But where I can find common ground, I will certainly seek it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: That's when I've done during my time in the general assembly where nearly every bill I passed, passed with bipartisan support.",

      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe are you are being treated with dignity by your colleagues?",

I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.",
      "And I look forward to working with any colleague who's ready to work and ready to be serious about the issues that matter because, at the end of the day, how I'm being treated does not matter. What matters is how the American people are being treated, and whether we're actually focused on the issues that matter to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of your fellow congressional Democrats, including Tom Suozzi and Seth Moulton, have also recently spoken about their feelings, looking back at the last election, and said Democrats should be more open about saying whether they object to transgender athletes playing in girls' sports. Those were the specific examples they brought up.",
      "How would you respond to your soon-to-be Democratic colleagues on those? Do you understand why some parents, for example, feel uncomfortable or frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Look, I think this country is still entering into a conversation about who trans people are, the full diversity of the community. And I've had conversations with colleagues in the Democratic caucus already that span diversity of thought about how the party should engage on a whole host of issues.",
      "But I think we are all united that every single American deserves equal rights, I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean spirited but really an attempt to misdirect. Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. It is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time - every single time we hear them say the word trans, look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors while privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Look what they're doing undermining workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: And here's also what we have to be clear about, because I think the last week has been a prime example of this. Every bit of time and energy that is used to divert the attention of the federal government to go after trans people is time and energy that is not focused on addressing the cost of living for our constituents. And we have clear that there is a real cost for the American worker every time they focus on this.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War With Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House. Good morning and welcome back.",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Good morning Margaret, happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you. I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks, the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S. made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti personnel landmines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office. Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really, it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so it's another one of these examples how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons. And so I think it's- it's important, because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in, and you see Russia throwing troops into- into- into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking, you know, they're taking tens of 1000s of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can. And they're trading some- some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces. So the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of how, what is- what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, \"push us out by Jan. 20,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation, he is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid, the Vice President Elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what- what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's- it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective. I think, and what I hope, is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself, will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order. I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean, North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China is doing to sustain Russia's war making- making machine, with the cash Vladimir Putin needs, but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran- Iran is providing the Shahed drones and missiles. North Korea is also providing, you know, 8 million rounds of artillery. So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of democratic control, the Senate and the White House has a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by the end of December, pass the defense bil l-the NDAA- and extension to the farm bill. And I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding- emergency Relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The President has now submitted a $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief, and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone. Is that right?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This- that's part of the Emergency Relief Fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike will support disaster relief. We've always had the philosophy\" all for one and one for all\" when Americans get hit by these disasters, I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon, and as you know, a new commander-in-chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies. But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, for example. Or this new choice to be labor secretary?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is this is what the vetting process is all about. The hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations, and I take that responsibility very seriously. I have been troubled by some talk that President-elect Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new Republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do it and run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out. Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done, and I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7 of last year and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the President had effectively used US leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely, and then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months, the President will finally make more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law, to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza and they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding, US law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department is reviewing 500 incidents where US weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel is doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the President of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500 as you said. And we haven't gotten the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process, because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen US weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM-20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that US weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed US officials on this privately, they've said, \"What do you want us to do? You want us to put in a halt for a few weeks and then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point?\" How do you respond to that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The President had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level- at the senior level, who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a cease fire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet, President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Why?--",
      "SEN. VAN HALLEN: \u2013for his obstruction on this, even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the President of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean, he's been ignored on other things too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the Palestinian Authority--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts, and yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books. So this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course, we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position. Thank you. We'll be right back."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 24, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee. Welcome back to \"Face The Nation,\" Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training. I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline. Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK jr. at HHS Secretary, Dave Weldon, the CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy. I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65 and yet the Biden administration, Rochelle Walensky, actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your six-month-old. And the American public is rejecting this. Only about 20% of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Well its vaccination rates in other- other vaccines as well not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013Right but people have to believe it, right exactly, but people are doubting because they're being told that. I'll give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine, are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines, but like when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just- my babies new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, Why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months? So really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country. I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees. From what I heard you, you have been- I'm sorry, did you want to say?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SEN. PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though, but you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57% of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters. The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40% say the US military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I'm 100% supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people. Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say All-points bulletin, all in but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. We've, we've had a distrust of putting the army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to Judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific. And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, he's going to resist that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court. And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is- what he is offering, is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government. Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and really, I think will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40 year period of time. The. What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up. There are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS Secretary Kristi Noem?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image. But I will tell you, but just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen, and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol. And they have a list now of 15,000 I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list. You put these people on an All-points bulletin. These are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on. And they would go out and seek those people that we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes, that should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them, in all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from. So I think if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi automatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right",
      "SEN. PAUL: Object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard. That specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors. I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or army. I think there's a lot of FBI, there's a lot of border patrol agents. There's a better way to do it, and it needs to be individualized. That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor. Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SEN.\u00a0 PAUL: You know, I've heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive. I don't like tariffs, but then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel, there are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel. So yeah, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people. I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against best and because it's also the President's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade. It's part of one of the booms of post-war and post-industrial revolution. These amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail. As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, in 2017 I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go, it's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue that you have to have spending cuts. So, I've always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I've also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut- cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector. I think that's a good idea, but if you do it. I would cut spending, and there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force, that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86% prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64% polled by us, think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington. Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yes, and I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit. And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013yes",
      "SEN. PAUL: and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013And so I think that the people are, and would be, overwhelmingly in favor",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: -Of someone who's going to base hiring on merit not on racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute."

    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform,\" Duckworth said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.\"",
      "Trump tapped Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as his pick to head the Defense Department earlier this month. The 44-year-old has drawn criticism for his stance on women in combat roles, along with his level of experience.",
      "Duckworth, who in 2004 deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and sustained severe injuries when her helicopter was hit by an RPG, outlined that women who serve in combat roles have met the same standards as men, passing rigorous testing. She said Hegseth's position \"just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is,\" while arguing that he's \"inordinately unqualified for the position.\"",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform,\" Duckworth said. She added that having women in the military \"does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth has also drawn scrutiny amid recently unearthed details about an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter. The Monterey County district attorney's office declined to file charges as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" His lawyer has acknowledged that Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement to the woman out of concern that the allegation would jeopardize his employment.",
      "Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, said it's \"really troubling\" that Trump would nominate someone who \"has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him.\"",
      "\"This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense,\" she added.",
      "The comments come after Trump announced a slew of picks for top posts in his administration in recent days. Meanwhile, one pick \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general \u2014 has already withdrawn his name from consideration after he faced intense scrutiny amid a House Ethics Committee investigation and a tenuous path to Senate confirmation.",
      "While Duckworth acknowledged that she's glad her Senate Republicans \"held the line\" on Gaetz and also elected Sen. John Thune as leader over a candidate favored by many in Trump's orbit, she said she's \"deeply concerned\" her Republican colleagues will green light Trump's nominees.",
      "\"From what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\" Duckworth said.",
      "But Duckworth didn't rule out supporting some of the nominees herself during the Senate confirmation process, pledged to evaluate each candidate based on their ability to do the job, and their willingness to put the needs of the American people before \"a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a CBS News poll released on Sunday found that 33% of Americans say Hegseth is a \"good choice\" for defense secretary, including 64% of Trump voters. But 39% of Americans said they hadn't heard enough yet about the pick. More broadly, Americans generally say they want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said he believes that Hegseth can run the massive Defense Department, despite his lack of experience managing a large organization. Though he did not address Hegseth's comments about women in combat roles, Paul said he believes the \"vast majority of people\" support leaders who are picked based on merit, citing Hegseth's criticism of the Pentagon for what he says has been a move away from merit-based hiring and toward hiring based on \"racial characteristics.\"",

He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has returned incredible new photos of the Sombrero galaxy, offering a new look at the region.",
      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",
      "Photos taken by the Webb telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, reveals a new texture in the galaxy's outer ring and details the dust along the ring. Such dust is an \"essential building block\" for solar objects, NASA said.",
      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October. Many are requesting to observe distant galaxies like the Sombrero galaxy, NASA said.",

      "\"And I kept saying, like, that's our planet,\" she added, wiping away tears. \"That's our planet. It was the same feeling I got when my kids were born, and I was like, that's my baby, that's my baby. I had that same feeling like where I'm seeing it for the first time. It was just beautiful.

      "Calandrelli, developer Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon, both making their second New Shepard flight, and three other entrepreneurs \u2014 Austin Litteral, James Russell and Henry Wolfond \u2014 blasted off from Bezos' sprawling ranch near Van Horn, Texas, at 10:30 a.m. EST. Accelerated to nearly three times the speed of sound, the crew capsule was released to fly on its own about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "As it continued coasting upward, the passengers were able to unstrap and float about the cabin during about three minutes of weightlessness, taking in the view of Earth below and space above from the largest windows ever built into a spacecraft.",

      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "title": "Bitcoin hovers around $100,000 as post-election rally rolls on",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:30:07 -0500",
    "summary": "While some are bullish, other experts warn of investment risks as what comes next is impossible to know.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",
      "Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000 and investors do not appear to be fazed by gravity or any cautionary tales of the cryptocurrencies history of volatility.",
      "Cryptocurrencies and related investments like crypto exchange traded funds have rallied because the incoming Trump administration is expected to be more \"crypto-friendly\" than the outgoing Biden administration.",
      "As of 11:02 a.m. ET, bitcoin traded at $96,747 after rising as high as $98,349 according to CoinDesk.",
      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Cryptocurrency is making lots of noise, literally",
      "Cryptocurrency is making lots of noise, literally",

      "Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who is helping lead a Trump-sanctioned effort to get the new Department of Government Efficiency off the ground, claimed on his social media platform Thursday that he had \"just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock.\"",
      "Bezos clapped back. \"Nope. 100% not true,\" he responded\u00a0on X, the social media platform Musk owns. A representative for Bezos declined further comment, pointing to Bezos' post.",

      "Although the Amazon founder defended the decision as a \"principled\" one, critics decried the move as an effort to avoid antagonizing Trump should he get elected. Famed former Washington Post editor Marty Baron blasted the decision as \"cowardice,\" while several prominent journalists at the paper quit. National Public Radio later reported that more than 200,000 WaPo readers had canceled their subscriptions.",

    "title": "Here's why Trump thinks tariffs are good for the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer.

      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service.

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:30:16 -0500",
    "summary": "John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., talks about the company's decision to scale back its DEI policies.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart's decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies nationwide is designed to \"ensure every customer, every associate\" feels welcome and like they belong, according to John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S.",
      "\"Like many companies all across the United States, we've been on a journey and we continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",
      "Furner said Walmart is undergoing the changes to help foster inclusion.",
      "\"We're going to continue to make the best decisions we can that makes everyone \u2013 our customers, our associates \u2013 feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Walmart's decision comes amid growing pressure from conservatives to halt corporate DEI policies, which ramped up after the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023\u00a0ending affirmative action in college admissions. Some conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace DEI initiatives as well as hiring practices that give boosts to historically marginalized groups.",
      "Other corporations that have recently backed away from DEI policies include\u00a0Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson.",
      "When asked if diversity among suppliers remains important to Walmart, Furner turned the focus to small businesses and small suppliers.",
      "\"We'll continue to do the things we can do to ensure small suppliers have a path to be successful,\" he said, noting that Walmart started in 1962 as a single store in Rogers, Arkansas.",
      "Walmart is also committed to selling American-made goods, which make up about two-thirds of what the company sells, Furner said, adding, \"We're going to continue to lean into ensuring that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, our supplies to be successful here in the store.\"",
      "How Walmart's preparing for Trump's proposed tariffs",
      "Walmart will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump's new trade policies, as the retailer's products are mostly made within the U.S., Furner said. Even so, he acknowledged customers may see some impact on prices.",
      "On Monday, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise, threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 America's top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data \u2013 \u00a0as one of his \"many first Executive Orders.\"",
      "Trump said he plans to add a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which he described as part of his crackdown on drugs and immigration. He said the tariffs would stand \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! \"",
      "\"We'll adjust to any environment. We've been in an environment with tariffs now for the last seven years,\" Furner said, adding that they have a team of people who are responsible for managing changes in trade policy.",
      "Furner said Walmart will do everything possible \u2013 between the suppliers and supply chain \u2013\u00a0 to keep prices low and help people save money.",
      "\"We're going to focus on products and values,\" Furner said, noting the company continues to monitor and evaluate the incoming Trump administration's potential plans.",

    "story": [
      "A California man who prosecutors alleged lied to federal agents and pushed fake criminal allegations against President Biden and his son Hunter now faces new charges of tax evasion from special counsel David Weiss, according to court records.",
      "Alexander Smirnov was an FBI informant for about a decade, providing information to federal investigators in what his defense attorneys claimed in court filings demonstrated an \"undivided, years-long loyalty to the United States.\"",
      "But Weiss \u2014 the Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. attorney who was kept on during the Biden administration and later elevated to the role of special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to continue the Hunter Biden probes \u2014 alleged in a February 2024 indictment that Smirnov illegally made false claims to FBI handlers about Hunter and Mr. Biden that dated back to 2020.",
      "Smirnov was accused of lying to investigators when he told them the two Bidens had each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",
      "Smirnov, who court records say was born in Ukraine, pleaded not guilty to the charges and in court filings, his defense team has accused prosecutors of charging their client \"as a result of the rejection of Hunter Biden's plea resolutions.\" He remains in pretrial detention pending trial.",
      "On Nov. 21, just weeks before he was set to go to trial on Dec. 3, federal prosecutors in Weiss' office filed a little-noticed indictment in a separate case against Smirnov, alleging he had illegally concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in income between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Court records alleged Smirnov spent unreported income on a Las Vegas apartment, a Bentley and payments on credit card debt. Prosecutors did not name the alleged source of the funds, but the dates and amounts of his payments to him from a single company identified in their filing as \"Company 1\" coincide with payments they alleged Smirnov received from the Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation, which was named in court records filed in Smirnov's other case. The new charges do not indicate any wrongdoing by Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation. Other income came from an unnamed individual, the new indictment said.",
      "\"In order to conceal the millions of dollars he received in income in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Defendant created and filed false Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns, for himself and in Domestic Partner's name that included false and fictitious income and expenses,\" the 27-page indictment filed last week said.",
      "According to newly published court records, the judge overseeing Weiss' first case against Smirnov \u2014 District Court Judge Otis Wright \u2014 held a status conference on Tuesday and delayed his upcoming trial on the false statements charges until January.",
      "Responding to the new tax charges, David Chesnoff, Smirnov's attorney, told CBS News, \"Mr. Smirnov intends to vigorously defend this case as he is vigorously defending the first case.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Weiss declined to comment when contacted by CBS News.",
      "Prosecutors alleged earlier this year that Smirnov's false claims against the Bidens were memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD 1023. Congressional Republicans previously pointed to that document's allegations of bribery as evidence of misdeeds and fought with the FBI to publicly release the document, which investigators now say contained fake allegations.",
      "Smirnov's attorneys have argued in court records that the case \"smacks of political bias.\" But prosecutors pushed back, writing this month that Smirnov, \"has never provided any discovery to the government or evidence to this Court supporting his baseless claims\u2014indeed, there is no such evidence because the claims are meritless.\"",
      "In court records filed earlier this year, the special counsel said Smirnov told the FBI about contacts with foreign intelligence officials, \"including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently.\" Defense attorneys in court filings of their own called allegations of Russian ties baseless.",
      "Apart from the specific charges at issue, law enforcement experts told CBS News earlier this year that the mounting questions about Smirnov's truthfulness should trigger an audit of every case in which he was involved. A CBS News investigation published earlier this year revealed that serious doubts about Smirnov's credibility were raised almost a decade ago.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the results of the CBS News investigation earlier this year.",
      "Weiss secured a conviction against Hunter Biden in Delaware on illegal gun charges and a guilty plea from the president's son in a second case in California in which Hunter Biden admitted to tax fraud. He is set to be sentenced in both cases later this month.",
      "The trial conviction and guilty plea were the results of a protracted legal battle between Weiss's office and Hunter Biden's legal team after an initial plea and diversion agreement fell apart and ultimately were rejected by a federal judge in 2023.",

      "A special agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been charged with sexually assaulting two women, according to police and court records. The agent, Eduardo Valdivia, was previously acquitted of attempted murder for shooting a man on a Metro subway train\u00a0near Washington, D.C.,\u00a0 four years ago. He was arrested in Maryland on Monday.",
      "Valdivia has been suspended by the FBI, pending the conclusion of a police investigation in Montgomery County, Maryland, a bureau spokesperson said.",
      "\"The FBI takes allegations of criminal violations and misconduct very seriously. We are aware of the matter involving the recent arrest of an FBI employee and are fully cooperating with the Montgomery County Police Department. Because this is an ongoing investigation, the FBI cannot comment further,\" the FBI said in a statement to CBS affiliate\u00a0WUSA.",
      "Valdivia previously was charged and acquitted in 2022 of attempted second-degree murder and other charges, including first-degree assault and reckless endangerment, in the off-duty shooting of another man while aboard a moving Metro train near Washington, D.C. The agent eventually turned himself in to local authorities at a county jail, and a judge soon after agreed to release him on personal recognizance, without objection from the prosecution.",
      "A Maryland jury found Valdivia not guilty of the murder or related charges, after the agent claimed he acted in self-defense. Those charges stemmed from an apparent verbal confrontation with the other man on that Metro train. Police for the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority said about a week after the shooting that the injured man was in stable condition.",
      "Online court records show Valdivia now faces felony and misdemeanor charges, including two counts of second-degree rape. The dates of the alleged offenses are in May 2024 and September 2024.",
      "Defense attorney Robert Bonsib, who represented Valdivia in the shooting case, confirmed that his client was arrested Monday on sexual assault charges.",
      "\"We don't accept at first blush any of the allegations until all of the evidence is in,\" Bonsib said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Montgomery County Police Department identified Valdivia as the arrested FBI agent without commenting on his connection to the shooting.",
      "Police detectives believe there may be additional victims, and they're planning a news conference on Tuesday \"to encourage them to come forward,\" the department said in a statement. Police didn't immediately release any other information about the charges.",
      "Valdivia, 40, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was ordered held in custody after his initial court appearance on Monday, Bonsib said. Valdivia is scheduled to return to court Tuesday for a bond hearing before a judge, Bonsib said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia joined the FBI in 2011 and was promoted to supervisory special agent at the FBI headquarters in 2019. The attorney said Valdivia had been working as an FBI agent since his acquittal.",
      "On Dec. 15, 2020, a confrontation between Valdivia and an unarmed passenger swiftly escalated from a testy exchange of words to a shooting on a train approaching the Medical Center station in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Valdivia shot and wounded the man from a distance of roughly 2 to 3 feet after repeatedly telling the man to back up, county prosecutor Robert Hill said in court. The wounded man had part or all of his spleen, colon and pancreas removed during surgery after the shooting, Hill said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia acted in self-defense as the man approached him at the rear of a train car.",
      "\"The law does not require that you wait to be struck before you take action. Had this resulted in a hands-on fight and a struggle for Agent Valdivia's gun, only God knows what could have happened,\" Bonsib said after Valdivia was charged.",

      "\"Having a young child in this country is a cause of poverty. It's not correlated with it, it is a cause of poverty,\" Elliot Haspel, the author of the nonfiction book \"Crawling Behind, America's Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It,\"\u00a0told the Harvard Graduate School of Education in October.",

Overall, the nation's child care workforce is among the lowest 5% paid of all occupations, noted Haspel.",

    "summary": "Winter storm weather is forecast to bring snow to different parts of the country in the days around Thanksgiving 2024, potentially interrupting travel.",
    "story": [
      "A messy spell of winter weather continued to dominate forecasts Tuesday across the United States, with a mix of rain and snow expected to materialize in different areas around the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Storms could potentially impact travel plans, particularly for people in eastern parts of the country, while the Mountain West could feel the effects of an \"Arctic blast\" overnight Wednesday into Thursday.",
      "Map of the Thanksgiving weather forecast for 2024",
      "\"A mix of rain and snow are possible across the eastern third of the country on Thanksgiving Day,\" said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, who noted forecasting models were \"reaching a consensus\" by Tuesday and indicated the I-95 corridor, which runs along the East Coast from Miami to the Canadian border with Maine, would likely receive rain.\u00a0Interior regions of the Northeast, like upstate New York, would likely see snow.",
      "Between 1 and 4 inches of snowfall could accumulate in those interior regions, Nolan said, while as much as a total 3 inches of rain could fall on affected areas.",
      "Temperatures are expected to drop across a majority of the U.S., with northern places like Minneapolis preparing for extreme cold. Chilly conditions will probably spare southeastern states, forecasts show.",
      "Where will winter storms hit hardest for Thanksgiving?",
      "Winter weather advisories were in place Tuesday for northern Michigan, where forecasters at the National Weather Service warned up to 6 inches of additional snowfall could accumulate in some places by the evening. Advisories were set to remain active through 7 p.m. in the local time zone.",
      "\"Expect the lake effect snowfall to pick up this afternoon when a stronger band moves onshore. Should the band remain onshore into tonight, the Winter Weather Advisory may need to be extended in time in the future,\" states an alert issued early Tuesday morning by the weather service in Marquette, Michigan. Forecasters advised people to plan for \"slippery road conditions and reduced visibility,\" potentially during their morning and evening commutes.",
      "Additional advisories were effective in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday afternoon. In Albany, New York, forecasts warned that \"pockets of freezing rain\" could create dangerous road conditions in the southern Adirondacks, Lake George and Saratoga regions, and southern Vermont before transitioning into normal rainfall Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Be aware of slippery roads and sidewalks during the morning commute or if traveling early for Thanksgiving,\" states a message from the weather service in Albany. Freezing rain could potentially result in up to a tenth of an inch of ice, according to Nolan.",
      "Farther west, a low-pressure weather system tied to the ongoing atmospheric river\u00a0continued to shift inward from coastal areas, bringing with it rain and snow. The wintry weather prompted warnings in Nevada, as forecasters in Las Vegas predicted up to 14 inches of snow could fall in areas with higher elevation.",
      "Meanwhile, the threat of impending snowfall triggered a series of avalanche warnings in Colorado. Nolan said as much as 3 feet of snow could stack up in certain parts of the Colorado Rockies, with forecasts showing winds of 30-40 miles per hour could tear through the region along with the storms.",
      "Will winter storms impact Thanksgiving travel?",
      "Estimates suggest an unprecedented number of people will crowd roads and airports this week, as figures reported by AAA showed 80 million were expected to travel at least 50 miles over the next seven days. If the calculation hold up, it would set a new Thanksgiving record. Complicating the anticipated congestion is the major storm affecting huge sections of the U.S., from the western Rocky Mountains to the East Coast.",
      "\"We've been talking about it basically on repeat since Friday: storms on the West Coast, storms in the Northeast, and now a storm in the Mountain West,\" said CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave,\u00a0reporting from LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York, on Tuesday. \"So airports from San Francisco to Las Vegas, Salt Lake, Denver, and here in the Northeast, D.C. to Boston, could all see delays today as these various storm systems are moving around. A lot to watch.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said 50,000 flights were scheduled Tuesday, Van Cleave reported, noting the agency expects air travel to be even busier Wednesday and Sunday.",
      "Where will it snow on Thanksgiving?",
      "The storm system's track was still somewhat uncertain Tuesday, but forecasters said below-average temperatures in the Northeast \u2014 especially in interior areas \u2014 could determine whether different locations in the region are hit with rain or snow.",
      "In the lead-up to Thanksgiving Day, forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center said heavy snow across the southern Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West and Central Rockies earlier in the week will be followed by snow showers across the Great Lakes that could result in up to 8 inches of snowfall by Thursday in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.",
      "As temperatures tick downward over the Northern Plains ahead of the holiday, the weather prediction center said a series of disturbances over the Central U.S. would \"facilitate an arctic outbreak across the region\" overnight Wednesday into Thanksgiving.",

      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote on social media, complaining that \"thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,\" even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! \"",

      "Trump made the announcements on his Truth Social site Monday evening as he railed against an influx of illegal migrants.",
      "CBS News also reported Monday that unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month.",
      "Trump also turned his ire on China, saying he has \"had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail.\"",
      "\"Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic before he takes office in the new year.",
      "Much of America's fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, if confirmed, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other nations. He has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation with other countries.",
      "He wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week, before his nomination, that tariffs are \"a useful tool for achieving the president's foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"",
      "If Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:01:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most Americans are forced to retire earlier than they had expected, often disrupting their financial planning.",
    "story": [
      "The typical American retires far earlier than he or she expects to, and it's often not by choice, according to new research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",
      "The median retirement age in the U.S. is 62, with nearly six in 10 retirees telling the research firm that they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned. Almost half of those people said the reason came down to health issues, such as physical limitations or disability. Losing a job or an organizational change at their employer were among the other reasons people stopped working before they planned to retire.",
      "\"Financially precarious\"",
      "The findings underscore the fragility of retirement in the U.S., with older Americans often finding themselves retired before they're financially ready to call it quits. And with many people outliving earlier generations \u2014 the typical respondent told Transamerica they believe they'll live to age 90 \u2014 they're also facing the prospect of supporting themselves financially for several decades in retirement, which can easily stretch or even exhaust their savings.",
      "\"Many of them are financially precarious \u2014 if they were to have some sort of major financial shock or their health would decline and needed long-term care, they would have a hard time affording it,\" Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The research backs up previous research about the typical retirement age, with the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute finding earlier this year that the median retirement age for Americans is 62. That underscores a gap between retirement plans and reality, with business leaders and policy experts often urging Americans to work longer so they can save more for their old age \u2014 a strategy that often doesn't unfold as envisioned.",
      "Retirees forced to leave their jobs earlier than planned is a \"cautionary tale for people currently in the workforce,\" Collinson said.",
      "People should actively maintain their health and keep their skills up to date, while also educating themselves about retirement and financial planning, as well as socking away savings, she noted.",
      "Why Americans claim Social Security early",
      "Retiring before a person expects may explain why millions of Americans claim Social Security before they reach their \"full retirement age,\" or the age at which they are entitled to their full benefits.",
      "Retirement experts generally urge Americans to hold off on claiming Social Security as long as possible because of the financial benefits of waiting. Workers can file for the retirement benefit as early as age 62, but the tradeoff is a roughly 30%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in their monthly checks compared with waiting until full retirement age, which is either 66 or 67 depending on one's birth year.",
      "But the median age when Americans claim Social Security benefits is 63, Transamerica found in its survey of more than 2,400 retirees. That means many older Americans are locking themselves into permanently lower monthly checks throughout their retirement.",
      "On the flip side, waiting until age 70 to collect Social Security \u2014 the maximum age to claim benefits \u2014 provides a boost of more than 30% to one's monthly benefits. Despite that incentive, Transamerica found that only 4% of retirees wait until 70 to file for their benefits.",
      "\"One of the most important things they can do is fully understand their benefits, and if they have any options to stretch out those benefits,\" Collinson said. \"If it's a spousal situation, maybe if they need the income, one claims first and the other later, or if they can jump back in the workforce and hit the pause button on Social Security and get more income.\"",
      "Another reason for claiming Social Security early is likely that many retirees may not have enough money put away in a retirement fund to keep them afloat. Only about half of U.S. retirees participated in a 401(k) or similar plan throughout their working careers, while more than one in four said their employer never offered retirement benefits while they worked, Transamerica found.",
      "About 6 in 10 retirees cited Social Security as their primary source of income, underscoring the importance of the program for older Americans. By comparison, only about 1 in 10 said retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs would be their main source of income.",
      "Challenged but happy",
      "Despite the challenges, many retirees are sanguine about stepping back from work, the study found. Almost 9 in 10 described themselves as being generally happy and having close relationships with family and friends.",
      "\"One of the things that stands out is retirees are really enjoying their time in retirement, which I think bodes well for all of us,\" Collinson said. \"They've made some adjustments, especially to their financial situation, and overall they are doing well.\"",
      "Americans \"dream of retirement,\" she added. \"Retirement is more about freedom and the ability to spend their time as they want to, rather than it is financial freedom specifically.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel's Cabinet has approved the ceasefire after urging from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. helped secure a ceasefire deal in Lebanon, which would end fighting between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.",
      "His announcement came as Israel's Cabinet approved the ceasefire after urging from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The war between Israel and the Iran-backed group has killed almost 3,800 people in Lebanon over the last year and left about 16,000 others wounded.",
      "\"Today, I have some good news to report from the Middle East,\" Mr. Biden said on the White House South Lawn. \"I just spoke with the prime minister of Israel and Lebanon. I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States' proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. I want to thank President Macron of France for his partnership in reaching this moment.\"",
      "Under the deal reached, the ceasefire will be effective as of 4 a.m. Wednesday local time and fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border \"will end,\" Mr. Biden said. But as Mr. Biden noted, the ceasefire does not apply to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,\" he added. \"What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed, I emphasize, will not be allowed, to threaten the security of Israel ever again.\"",
      "Over the next 60 days, the Lebanese Army and state security forces will take control once again, he said, and Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces. Since the war with Hezbollah began, over 70,000 Israelis have been \"forced to live as refugees in their own country,\" Mr. Biden said, and over 300,000 Lebanese people have also been forced from their homes.",
      "\"Let's be clear,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either, nor did the United States.\"",
      "Echoing remarks from earlier from Netanyahu, Mr. Biden said if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense.",
      "And in a joint statement later released by Mr. Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, the two leaders said that \"the announcement today will cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon,\" adding that it \"will create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line.\"",
      "Netanyahu said earlier Tuesday that the war Cabinet had approved the ceasefire, and he urged ministers in the full Cabinet to approve the deal on Tuesday night. He did not give specifics, but he said if Hezbollah breaks the terms, Israel will \"respond severely.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the war Cabinet had approved the ceasefire, and he urged ministers in the full Cabinet to approve the deal on Tuesday night. He did not give specifics, but he said if Hezbollah breaks the terms, Israel will \"respond severely.\"",
      "Netanyahu also held meetings Tuesday in Tel Aviv with various government ministers, lawmakers and mayors from some of the northern towns that have been evacuated for months.",
      "Lebanon's government also had to unilaterally approve the deal on Tuesday, but the U.S. official said that was expected. The ceasefire would end the deadliest war in Lebanon since its civil war, which ended in 1990.",
      "Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati posted on social media calling for the international community to \"implement an immediate ceasefire.\"",
      "U.S. Defense Department spokesperson Patrick Ryder said Tuesday that \"we are certainly very supportive of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Under the deal, a full and permanent ceasefire would be implemented immediately. There will be 60 days permitted for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces \u2014 a gradual withdrawal to allow the Lebanese forces to mobilize and move in to secure the area, but the trigger time is immediate, set to take effect later Tuesday.",
      "The first peel-off of Israeli troops was to begin within the next 10 days.",
      "Hezbollah is expected to pull its forces and heavy weapons back about 20 miles from the Israeli border, to the Litani River.",
      "Under the deal, Hezbollah will move north of the so-called Litani Line, a senior Biden administration official told reporters in a call Tuesday, while the Lebanese Armed Forces will move south of that line and take position. Hezbollah, as part of the agreement, will not be permitted to rebuild infrastructure or weaponry again in the area they vacating, the official said.",
      "\"As the Lebanese military deploys and reaches the South, the Israeli military will withdraw,\" the official explained.",
      "The U.S. will not post American troops in the area, but the U.S. and France will provide additional support \u2014 such as equipment training and financial resources \u2014 to the Lebanese army, the official added. That will be done through the Military Technical Committee, a previously formed international coalition that was revived by the U.S. a few months ago.",
      "The U.S. and France will also join an existing mechanism referred to as the Tripartite Mechanism which was created shortly after the 2006 Lebanon War, the official said. The U.S. will chair it, and through diplomats and military personnel, receive and attempt to deter complaints by either side of potential violations.",
      "The official said that the Trump team was not involved in the ceasefire negotiations. However, following the presidential election \u2014 and once it appeared that a deal may be close \u2014 the Biden administration briefed President-elect Donald Trump's national security team for the first time on the tenants of the deal, saying that the Trump team seemed to be supportive.",
      "According to a U.S. official, Iran has also been briefed, given Tehran's support of Hezbollah \u2014 \u00a0a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon that has long been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel.",
      "\"We are in the final stages of securing a ceasefire agreement for Lebanon,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Tuesday after meeting with G7 counterparts in Italy. \"We are not there yet, but I believe we are in the final stages.\"",
      "\"This has been an intensive diplomatic effort by the United States, partners like France working with Israel, working with Lebanon, over many months,\" Blinken said, \"and if we get to the conclusion that I hope we reach very soon, it will make a big difference. It will make a big difference in saving lives and livelihoods, in Lebanon and in Israel. It will make a big difference in creating the conditions that will allow people to return to their homes safely in northern Israel and in southern Lebanon.\"",
      "Hezbollah started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the\u00a0war in Gaza\u00a0with their terror attack the previous day.",
      "Israel carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it\u00a0dramatically escalated its assault\u00a0on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.",
      "CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said\u00a0rockets were still flying in both directions\u00a0over Israel's northern border on Tuesday, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date, even as diplomats push for peace.",
      "Under the proposed deal, Lebanese forces and United Nations peacekeepers are expected to jointly patrol southern Lebanon to ensure the terms of the agreement are adhered to. Earlier reports suggested the southern region would be monitored by a multi-nation committee, which would include both the U.S. and France.",
      "Middle East expert Danny Citrinowicz, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said the deal looked \"good on paper,\" but added that until it was implemented, \"it would be hard to know whether Israel can really build on these kind of guarantees coming from the U.S. administration.\"",
      "After more than a year of crossfire, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon, along with at least 60,000 from towns and villages in northern Israel. They're all desperate to go home, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the chief objective of the war with Hezbollah, from his government's standpoint, has been to enable them to do so.",
      "While a deal with Hezbollah appeared closer than ever, negotiations for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Iran's other proxy force in the Gaza Strip, Hamas \u2013 have gone nowhere.",
      "Blinken said Tuesday that de-escalating tensions in the region \"can also help us to end the conflict in Gaza.\"",
      "\"In particular Hamas will know it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war,\" he said.",
      "Many in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse. A winter chill has set in, and there were reports of a fresh Israeli strike killing about 15 people Tuesday in Gaza City.",

      "The FBI said it coordinated with U.K. authorities to arrest San Diego, who has been wanted in connection with two animal rights-related bombings in Northern California in 2003. He was put on the Most Wanted Terrorists list in 2009.",
      "\"Daniel San Diego's arrest after more than 20 years as a fugitive for two bombings in the San Francisco area shows that no matter how long it takes, the FBI will find you and hold you accountable,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement announcing the arrest. \"There's a right way and a wrong way to express your views in our country, and turning to violence and destruction of property is not the right way.\"",
      "The U.K. National Crime Agency said that San Diego was arrested in Conwy, a town near Wales' northern coast. He was arrested by officers from the agency's Joint International Crime Center at a property in a rural area next to a woodland, an agency spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "San Diego allegedly planted two bombs at the offices of Chiron Inc. in Emeryville, California, in August 2003. The first bomb detonated early in the morning. The second, which was set to detonate an hour after the initial blast and may have been meant to kill or injure first responders according to the FBI, was found and cleared before it could go off.",
      "A month later, San Diego allegedly planted another bomb at a company in Pleasanton, California. That bomb was wrapped in nails, the FBI said, but no one was injured when it went off.",
      "A federal arrest warrant was issued for San Diego in October 2003, but he disappeared before he could be taken into custody. A federal grand jury indicted San Diego with two counts of destroying or attempting to destroy property with explosives and two counts of use of a destructive device in a crime of violence in 2004.",

    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

    "summary": "South Africa's Cape Peninsula is a big tourist draw, but it's also home to hundreds of brazen baboons, and there's fear people-monkey encounters are set to rise.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014 It was a normal holiday morning. My family was getting up for the day and my husband had just left for a meeting. I was holding one of my children in my arms and another by the hand when I saw the front door handle turn and open in a quick gliding motion. I assumed it was my husband who had forgotten something.",
      "Instead, I turned and was shocked to see Split Lip, the alpha male baboon from the troop that was frequenting Misty Cliffs, a small beachside town on South Africa's far southern Atlantic coast, just south of Cape Town.",
      "The baboon jumped onto the nearby kitchen counter, picking up a glass bottle and swinging it in my direction as he opened kitchen drawers below him with his other hand, maybe looking for food. Instead he found a large bread knife, which he waved around his head with the bottle in his other hand, snarling at me and my kids.",
      "It was absolutely terrifying \u2014 a sort of Stephen King-meets-ET moment playing out on the kitchen counter of our vacation house.",
      "I ran downstairs with my kids and locked them in a bedroom, then came back up to call security. The terrifying 43-minute experience ended with me holding a bedroom door closed as he, having devoured the contents of our kitchen, jumped down the stairs scratching his nails on the walls before pulling on the other side of the door.",
      "The security company arrived, and I heard a zapping noise as Split Lip, who had tried to run back up the stairs past the security team in their flak jackets, encountered the team with what looked like a cattle prod.",
      "That was many years ago, but the terror of those 43 minutes remains etched in my family's memory. That baboon troop was moved soon after to the Cape Point national park. But the conflict between humans and baboons around Cape Town remains just as alarming, and things are getting worse, not better.",
      "Social media channels are full of clips showing incredibly brazen baboons waltzing into stores in the popular tourist destination of Simon's Town, stealing fruit and then sitting on roads eating the spoils of their foraging, carefree as they hold up traffic.",
      "Some very aggressive baboons no longer appear to fear humans at all. In the nearby town of Kommetjie, as more and more homes go up and their natural habitat shrinks, baboons came into direct conflict with the locals in October. Local social media groups update residents on the whereabouts of the baboon troop \u2014 roughly 40 of them \u2014 and users say the often-tense encounters are escalating.",
      "In 2001, the Urban Baboon Program was launched, and eight years later it was funded by Cape Town's city administration. The baboon management and monitoring partnership, working in conjunction with parks authorities, worked very well for more than a decade.",
      "Transponders were attached to baboons so the troops could be tracked and monitored, and local residents could be alerted.",
      "Keeping the system running efficiently became problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the baboons were essentially allowed to run amok. It has never come back into full swing, and facing widespread criticism, authorities have now said the program will remain in place until the end of November, but then be wound down while better solutions are considered.",
      "Cape Town's urban baboon program annual census found there were just over 500 chacma baboons roaming freely south of the city, including some animals weighing almost 90 pounds.",
      "Cleaning up after my family's encounter \u2014 which left a mess of food spoils and baboon feces \u2014 left one family member quite ill with a parasite called giardia. Baboons are known to carry many diseases.",
      "Animal rights activists argue that humans should learn to live with the apes as they're part of the local ecology. Many residents disagree, saying they fear for their safety. Kids get scared when dogs bark, fearing they're heralding the arrival of a baboon troop.",
      "Frustration is mounting, according to Jenni Trethowan, of the local Baboon Matters organization. She's one of four applicants taking the city of Cape Town and parks officials to court demanding a new solution.",
      "\"Its not rocket science,\" she told CBS News. \"Over the past 24 years, officials have researched and come up with strategic plans on a way forward in the best interest of the community and the baboons, and none of those plans have been implemented.\"",
      "Suggested plans include strategic fencing, baboon-proof garbage cans, and more rangers on patrol.",
      "The case will be taken up in court later this week.  \"If we win, there will be a timeline and accountability [for] implementing all these strategies that have been researched over years,\" Trethowan said. \"But if we lose, it's too difficult to contemplate.\"",
      "In the troop of 22 apes that Baboon Matters monitors, three baboons have been killed already this month by illegal shooting.",
      "\"In the last month, we have seen our highest death rate in the last few years,\" she said.",
      "As Cape Town gears up for its annual influx of foreign tourists for the holiday season, many locals are hoping the outsiders won't be tempted to feed the baboons.",
      "Regardless, when the tourists all head back home and the new year begins, residents will still be there, likely left to fend for themselves as there's currently no plan in place to deal with the 90-pound monkeys that prowl their neighborhoods.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 08:24:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Barbara Taylor Bradford\u200b was one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

      "More than 30 pilot whales that stranded themselves on a beach in New Zealand were safely returned to the ocean after conservation workers and residents helped to refloat them by lifting them on sheets. Four of the pilot whales died, New Zealand's conservation agency said.",
      "New Zealand is a whale stranding hotspot and pilot whales are especially prolific stranders.",
      "A team was monitoring Ruak\u0101k\u0101 Beach near the city of Whang\u0101rei in New Zealand's north on Monday to ensure there were no signs of the whales saved Sunday stranding again, the Department of Conservation told The Associated Press. The agency praised as \"incredible\" the efforts made by hundreds of people to help save the foundering pod.",
      "\"It's amazing to witness the genuine care and compassion people have shown toward these magnificent animals,\" Joel Lauterbach, a Department of Conservation spokesperson, said in a statement. \"This response demonstrates the deep connection we all share with our marine environment.\"",
      "The agency released images of the rescue effort on social media.",
      "**UPDATE**\n25/11 11am\n\nWe have had no further reports of strandings but we're still asking members of the public to stay...",
      "A M\u0101ori cultural ceremony for the three adult whales and one calf that died in the stranding took place on Monday. New Zealand's Indigenous people consider whales a taonga \u2014 a sacred treasure \u2014 of cultural significance.",
      "New Zealand has recorded more than 5,000 whale strandings since 1840. The largest pilot whale stranding was of an estimated 1,000 whales at the Chatham Islands in 1918, according to the Department of Conservation.",
      "It's often not clear why strandings happen but the island nation's geography is believed to be a factor. Both the North and South Islands feature stretches of protruding coastline with shallow, sloping beaches that can confuse species such as pilot whales \u2014 which rely on echolocation to navigate.",
      "Mass strandings of pilot whales have happened elsewhere in recent months.",

      "In April, a mass stranding of long-finned pilot whales in southwestern Australia led to the deaths of 29 of the beached creatures, but about 100 of the whales were rescued and redirected out to sea.",
      "Last year, nearly 100 pilot whales became\u00a0stranded on a beach\u00a0in Western Australia, but after a rescue attempt, they all died.",

A pilot whale's typical lifespan is anywhere from 35 to 60 years, although their survival is threatened by several factors including chemical contaminants, disease, entanglement in fishing gear and ocean noise. They tend to travel in dense pods, and much of what is known about the species and their behaviors has come out of other mass strandings.",

    "story": [
      "Vilnius, Lithuania \u2014 A DHL cargo plane crashed early Monday near the airport in Lithuania's capital, killing one person, authorities said as they searched for clues to what caused the tragedy. Lithuanian officials, who in the past weeks have been investigating incendiary devices allegedly sent on Western-bound cargo planes, stopped short of linking the crash with that investigation.",
      "\"It is premature to associate it with anything or to make any attributions,\" State Security Department chief Darius Jauniskis told reporters.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to Gabriella Hoffman, Independent Women\u2019s Forum Center for Energy & Conservation Director, about what she hopes the Trump administration will prioritize in the energy sector",
      "President-elect Trump is expected by many of his supporters to preside over an energy \"boom\" in the United States by slashing Biden administration regulations, and one industry expert told Fox News Digital that she is encouraged by Trump\u2019s energy sector cabinet nominees while outlining specific moves she hopes to see over the next four years.",
      "\"I think the three cabinet picks that Trump has so far chosen to lead EPA, Interior and Energy are a vast improvement to who we have currently in those respective positions,\" Gabriella Hoffman,\u00a0Independent Women\u2019s Forum Center for Energy & Conservation Director, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They're going to be taking a more tactful approach to energy development. They're not going to be keeping things in the ground. They're going to be prioritizing reliable energy sources like coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear even, and most recently, geothermal has also taken a renewed interest by Congress, and we will probably see geothermal as well unleashed. But also there's going to be this balance of this energy abundant mindset with promoting land stewardship, expanding hunting and fishing opportunities, expanding ocean access, and reevaluating so-called clean energy projects that promise to be greener or are believed to be green but actually might be worse for the environment and don't produce enough reliable energy or electricity.\"",

We're going to be less reliant on countries that produce certain energy sources less cleanly, less environmentally friendly than we do.\"",

      "\"Another priority is to kind of clamp down on this regulatory overreach we have seen across all three agencies. We have seen them take extreme positions with devising so-called tailpipe emissions standards, all these different green energy efficiency, household appliance directives. We've seen them take extreme positions on policies like the America the Beautiful Plan, or the 30 by 30 plan to protect so-called 30% of waters in lands by 2030, which is a very extreme position, not rooted in conservation whatsoever. It's a control mechanism, not a conservation tool.\"",

I think realistically, once we hit the six-month mark, perhaps the year-end mark if President-elect Trump is going to be able to repeal some of the Biden-Harris directives as it relates to all the climate measures, the day one executive orders are really going to be a weight off of the administrative state\u2019s shoulders and then all other policies that emanate from that tackling the climate crisis executive order will similarly be probably clamped down.\"",

So that law really does have to be kind of called into question. And perhaps Trump will work with Congress to ensure that that is repealed.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Facing the threat of a contempt of Congress vote, Secretary of State Antony Blinken finally agreed to testify in front of the 118th Congress' House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) on the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal after being sought to do so for months, according to a spokesperson for the committee's GOP majority.",
      "President Biden's Secretary of State is set to appear for a public hearing on Dec. 11, an HFAC majority spokesperson told Fox News Digital. His testimony will take place over three years after the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Blinken did testify directly after the withdrawal in front of the Democrat-controlled HFAC in September 2021.",
      "Blinken has previously refused to comply with the GOP-led committee's subpoena for testimony in 2024 on the Afghanistan withdrawal.",

      "In the recent Blinken contempt report, McCaul noted the 2021 \"appearance was prior to an investigation being launched by the Committee, meaning this Committee had yet to conduct any transcribed interviews or document discovery. As a result, the Committee did not have the benefit of its investigative findings to probe Secretary Blinken\u2019s testimony, which contained misleading accounts of the withdrawal and NEO under his leadership.\"",

      "\"It\u2019s unfortunate the secretary agreed to appear only after my committee\u00a0advanced\u00a0contempt proceedings against him. While I wish he had not delayed this crucial appearance until the end of his tenure as head of the State Department, I look forward to hearing his testimony and asking poignant questions\u00a0to\u00a0help House Republicans and the next administration ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\"",

He sought instead for his two deputies to testify, despite the fact that neither of them had been with the department during the withdrawal.",

      "Following his absence, the HFAC voted to recommend that Blinken be held in contempt of Congress for defying the subpoena. The vote was 26 to 25, along party lines.",
      "The committee spokesperson detailed the lengths to which the Republican majority went to work with Blinken to avoid using its subpoena power.

      "Kurt Knutsson explains how to safeguard retirement accounts from cyber threats with a VPN: encryption, anonymity, secure access.",
      "Protecting your financial future goes beyond smart investing and saving. It's crucial to safeguard your retirement accounts from cyber threats. While many believe that using\u00a0public Wi-Fi to check their 401(k) or IRA is harmless, the reality is that without proper protection, you could be putting your hard-earned savings at risk. Let's explore why using a VPN (virtual private network) is essential for securing your retirement accounts and how you can implement this extra layer of security.",
      "1 WEEK LEFT!\u00a0I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her tablet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "2) Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5) Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6) Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up to date with the latest security patches.",
      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

By implementing a VPN and following best security practices, you're taking proactive steps to ensure that the nest egg you've worked so hard to build remains safe and secure. Remember, the small investment in a quality VPN service is negligible compared to the potential losses from a compromised retirement account.",

      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson on the alleged text scam to gain access to users' Apple ID information and the popular new Noplace app being used by Gen Z.",
      "Macs are safer than Windows PCs, but they\u2019re not foolproof. Hackers occasionally find ways to infect Apple devices, and in most cases, we\u2019re the ones who allow it. Since infiltrating Apple\u2019s App Store is difficult, hackers trick people into downloading apps from third-party stores or random websites.",
      "These apps look legitimate but are actually tools for infecting devices with malicious software. A recent incident highlights this issue, with North Korean hackers targeting Macs by hiding malware in seemingly harmless macOS apps.",

      "How does the malware work?",
      "Recent discoveries by\u00a0Jamf Threat Labs have unveiled a sneaky form of malware targeting macOS computers. While it may sound technical, understanding the basics of how this malware operates can help you stay safe online.",
      "This malware hides in seemingly harmless applications, such as a game called Minesweeper and a note-taking app referred to as a Notepad. These apps function as expected, but behind the scenes, they run malicious programs that could allow hackers to take control of your computer.",
      "The apps use a technology called Flutter, a tool often used to create apps that work on multiple devices like phones and computers. Flutter makes it easier for app developers to design their software, but its unique structure also helps hackers hide their malicious code, making it harder for experts to detect.",
      "Once installed, the malware connects to a remote server (think of it as a command center for hackers) to receive instructions. These instructions could include running commands on your computer without your knowledge. One trick this malware uses is running AppleScripts, a type of script built for macOS systems, which can quietly execute commands to steal your data or even control your device.",
      "Even scarier, some versions of this malware had been signed and approved by Apple\u2019s security system before experts caught on. This means the hackers were testing how far they could push their schemes without raising suspicion.",

      "This malware isn\u2019t just a random act of cybercrime, it has ties to tactics and techniques often associated with North Korean hackers. Experts have identified similarities between this malware and previous attacks linked to North Korea, including the use of certain coding methods and domains that the country\u2019s cyber teams are known to exploit.",
      "North Korea has a history of using cyberattacks to fund its operations or disrupt systems worldwide, often targeting financial systems or vulnerable individuals. In this case, the malware seems to be in the testing phase, potentially laying the groundwork for a larger attack in the future.",
      "The apps containing the malware were designed to look harmless. These tactics suggest a focus on tricking people through social engineering, a method North Korean hackers have used in the past.",
      "By embedding the malware within apps that appear useful or fun, the attackers can increase the chances of someone downloading and using the infected software. While this particular malware has not yet been linked to active attacks, its connection to North Korea\u2019s cyber playbook is a strong indicator of potential risks ahead.",

      "1) Use reliable antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus program is your first line of defense against malicious links and malware that could steal your private information. Avoid clicking on random links, especially in emails or messages that claim to be urgent or demand updates. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. It can also warn you about phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping to keep your personal data and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful with downloads and links:\u00a0Only download apps from trusted sources like the Mac App Store or official websites of known developers. Hackers often disguise malware as legitimate updates or harmless apps.",
      "3) Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular updates for macOS and installed apps are essential because they patch security flaws. Apple frequently rolls out updates to address vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates ensures you stay protected without the hassle of manually checking for them.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0A strong password can help keep your Mac safe from unauthorized access. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here\u2014it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Activate\u00a02FA for key accounts like your Apple ID, email, and financial services. This adds a second layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your accounts\u2014even if they have your password.",

      "I've noticed a significant rise in malware hiding in seemingly harmless apps, whether it's related to Mac, Windows, Android, or even iPhones. It just shows that no device is completely safe, not even one made by Apple. Hackers, including those backed by North Korea, are constantly finding new ways to trick users into downloading malicious software. These attacks often fly under the radar because they look like regular, safe apps. With these threats becoming more sophisticated, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay aware of the risks and be cautious about what you download and click on.",

      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "A Stanford professor is accused of using an AI language model to write an expert declaration. (Getty Images)",
      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",

      "These days, data breaches and privacy concerns are rampant, so choosing the right email service is crucial.",
      "While free email providers may seem convenient, they often come with hidden costs to your privacy.",

      "A person typing on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The hidden costs of free email",
      "Free email services may not charge you money directly, but they often monetize your data in other ways. These providers typically engage in data collection and analysis, which can lead to targeted advertising and tracking of your email activity.",
      "As a result, they create comprehensive user profiles that can compromise your privacy and increase your vulnerability to cyber threats. Users often find themselves inundated with ads tailored to their interests, while their sensitive information remains at risk of misuse.",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Benefits of privacy-focused email services",
      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices. They offer an ad-free experience and give you greater control over your personal information. This means that when you choose a secure email service, you are investing in a platform that prioritizes your privacy and security.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Steps to switch to a secure email service",
      "Switching to a secure email service involves several steps that can enhance your online security. First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection. Finally, take some time to familiarize yourself with the new interface and features offered by your secure email service.",

      "HOW SCAMMERS USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR FINANCIAL SCAMS AND HOW TO STOP THEM",
      "The value of investing in privacy",
      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue. This ensures that the service remains accountable to you rather than marketers or corporate investors. Investing in a secure email service also provides peace of mind, knowing that your communications are protected from prying eyes.",

      "In an era where digital privacy is increasingly under threat, taking control of your email communications is a crucial step toward safeguarding your personal information.

Although there may be a small financial cost involved in switching to a secure email provider, the long-term benefits to your privacy and security are invaluable.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 10:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "As Black Friday approaches, you should know that retailers often sell consumers&apos; personal information and purchase histories to third parties.",
    "story": [
      "Lifestyle expert Carey Reilly shows various travel gifts for your family this summer.",
      "It\u2019s the perfect time to pick up holiday gifts for your family and treat yourself to that pricey watch you wouldn\u2019t splurge on otherwise.",
      "Black Friday is a worldwide cultural and economic phenomenon today. It comes with much anticipation, great discounts and a shopping frenzy. Its success is such that it now lasts the whole month. But don\u2019t let the excitement cloud your judgment.",
      "The deals are enticing, but there are dangers lurking beneath the surface.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman shopping online on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The devil\u2019s in the privacy policy",
      "Particularly when it comes to online shopping, we give up personal data with every purchase. Information such as your email address, name and address is necessary to create an account or receive a delivery. And that\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s used for these purposes only.",
      "However, the fine print linked under \"Privacy Policy\" that you agree to at checkout often comes with a long list or, worse still, an unspecified number of third parties with which your data will be shared. Retailers often sell personal information and purchase histories to third parties, such as marketing companies and data brokers, who use it to build detailed consumer profiles. Once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s very hard to remove your information from these third-party databases.",
      "Arguably, this happens all the time, Black Friday or not. But with all the marketing strategies pushing us to buy quickly and buy more, we\u2019re just less likely to pay attention.",

      "BEST WAY TO CONNECT YOUR NEW LAPTOP TO EXTERNAL DEVICES",

      "The term \"Black Friday\" was originally coined in the 1950s by Philadelphia police officers to describe the chaos that ensued the day after Thanksgiving, when hordes of shoppers and tourists flooded the city.",
      "After the shopping extravaganza of Black Friday, your inbox and phone may experience their own dark moments. A surge in spam is widely reported during the month of November. This unwanted communication can come from several sources.",
      "First, from the online shops where you\u2019ve left your email and phone number. Second, from all the companies that received your consumer profile, the ones listed (or not) in the fine print of the privacy policy. Third, from all the retailers you bought from in the past, including that one-time purchase of a kettlebell set three years ago (that you\u2019d rather forget).",
      "But that\u2019s not all; Black Friday is a fiesta for hackers, too, and the perfect time for social engineering attacks! The urgency and excitement of Black Friday deals encourage you to let your guard down. You\u2019re likelier to click on links or open attachments without checking the source. And less likely to notice that a phishing email pretending to be sent by a big retailer has sneaked into your inbox. Your data is being collected, shared and sold as you read this article.",

      "THE DANGEROUS INTERSECTION OF PEOPLE SEARCH SITES AND SCAMS",
      "How to buy without being sold at the same time",
      "Reading privacy policies every time you buy something isn\u2019t realistic. If you\u2019re ambitious, use the search function (Ctrl+F or Command+F) to find terms like \"opt out,\" \"unsubscribe\" or \"do not sell\" to quickly locate sections where you can limit data sharing. Depending on where you live, these options may simply not be available to you.",
      "An easier solution is to use a\u00a0disposable email address whenever you open an account for the sole purpose of making a purchase. Once you receive your order confirmation, you can disable it so that no further communication is sent your way. You can also use privacy-focused tools or browsers that block tracking cookies and prevent companies from collecting your data.",

      "As the dust settles from the shopping rush, it's crucial to be proactive; here are eight essential tips to help you protect your email and personal information from the surge of spam and scams that often follow.",
      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information. These resources can help you maintain your privacy while enjoying the benefits of online shopping. Also, remember that post-Black Friday, you may find yourself inundated with spam and unwanted communications from retailers and third parties. Taking proactive steps now can save you from future headaches.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Porch pirates are on the prowl this holiday season. Tech guru Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson has a number of tips to prevent holiday package thefts.",
    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",
      "A woman using a tracking app on her iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "A woman receiving packages at home (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS",
      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",
      "A person picking up packages for their neighbor (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",
      "To set up\u00a0Amazon delivery notifications, follow these quick steps.",

      "While human trafficking reports do not necessarily increase during the holiday season, busy shopping and transportation hubs may make it easier for traffickers to get away with criminal activity.",
      "There are some key signs of human trafficking that concerned citizens should look out for if they suspect nefarious activity, according to experts working to combat the global trafficking crisis, which the Department of Homeland Security defines as \"modern-day slavery\" that \"involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "\"Child sex trafficking happens 365 days a year in small towns, big cities across the country, and that definitely includes the holidays,\" Staca Shehan, vice president of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's (NCMEC's) Analytical Services Division, told Fox News Digital. \"Trafficking victims don't get days off or have holiday leave like many of us. That being said, though, our data does not show an increase in reports to the National Center of Child Sex Trafficking around the holidays, specifically the November to January timeframe.\"",

      "\"And that could lead to missed opportunities maybe to identify red flags,\" Shehan said. \"We know that traffickers take advantage of any type of opportunity. Children and teens, they're typically in school and around these holidays. They're off for longer periods of time. And that could mean that people who often have opportunities to see signs or red flags like teachers, school resource officers, school nurses \u2026 they may not have those opportunities during the holidays [to identify red flags].\"",
      "While home may be a safe place for some children, for others, it could be where their trafficker lives, and that person could have \"increased access\" to the victim while the victim is home from school and the trafficker is home from work for the holidays. There might also be substance or domestic abuse issues going on at a child's home that inspire them to run away and therefore make them become potential targets for human traffickers.",

      "Retired New York Police Department (NYPD) Sgt. Paul Grattan Jr., managing director of public safety consulting firm Graypoint Strategies, similarly said that while there is not much reliable information showing a particular increase in human trafficking during the holiday season, \"There are some circumstances during the holidays that may make it easier for traffickers.\"",
      "\"[T]he increase in travel presents opportunities for traffickers to move individuals or find potential victims traveling alone\u2026\"",
      "\"Vulnerable individuals are prime targets for traffickers, especially when they have leverage to coerce potential victims. The holidays can be a tough time of year for many who are separated from family or have otherwise been ostracized by loved ones due to personal struggles with drugs, alcohol, or crime,\" Grattan said.",

      "New statistics, Grattan explained, \"like calls to trafficking hotlines and cases prosecuted by U.S. Attorneys, point to a drastic increase in trafficking over the past ten years.\"",
      "\"The spike in migrants crossing the border is a big part of this \u2014 as people seeking a better life in the U.S. are drastically more vulnerable,\" the former NYPD officer said. \"Evidence supports that much of human trafficking is rooted in forced labor \u2014 something that criminals try to capitalize on with migrants trying to cross the border, find refuge in the U.S., make money, assist other family members, and travel to be closer to family who are already here.\"",

      "\"This includes businesses at large, so hotels, motels, shopping centers, convenience stores, truck stops would be one of them, as well,\" Shehan said. \"But it also includes places where families go.

      "Another place where human trafficking can take place, or at least be initiated, is online. Predators often use social media apps and gaming systems in an effort to contact children and groom them from behind a screen before they eventually convince that child to meet up in person.",
      "\"We know that the Internet is heavily used by teens, and it is a place where vulnerabilities can become more obvious, where there may be discussions about things the child is struggling with or some of the challenges that they face \u2014 it could be housing instability, that their family is in a situation of poverty. It could be a situation where they're sharing about abuse or neglect in the home,\" Shehan explained. \"And traffickers are savvy that they will use that as a point of manipulation to target that child and \u2026 manipulate them into a false sense of security, of safety or care or well-being.\"",

      "George Pino, 54, was operating a 29-foot vessel with his wife and 12 minors present on Sept. 4, 2022 when he crashed into a channel marker near Boca Chita Key, which killed 17-year-old Luciana Fernandez and seriously injured another 17-year-old and a 16-year-old, according to prosecutors and officials with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).",

      "FWC's investigation into the incident last year found that Pino was not impaired by drugs or alcohol while operating the boat due to the boat's driving pattern.",

      "\"Officers on the scene of the crash determined that Pino was not intoxicated; Pino did not exceed any posted speed limit, Pino had the required number of Coast Guard-approved life preservers on board the vessel, and despite sustaining a head injury himself (requiring fifteen stitches), Pino made heroic efforts to rescue the injured passengers, including diving under the capsized boat,\" Pino's attorney continued in the statement to Fox News Digital.",

The fact that the ICC lacked jurisdiction did not cause the ICC to pause even for a second. It was only President Trump\u2019s sanctions against the ICC (during his first term) that forced the ICC to obey the law and drop its threat to prosecute Americans.\u00a0Sanctions against the ICC will work; persuasion will not.\"",

The ICC has always preyed on the politically weak: formerly African countries and now the Jewish state. It is widespread antisemitism in the West, especially among progressives, that makes Israel politically weak and vulnerable.

      "The 287(g) program was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996 under then-President Bill Clinton. It authorizes ICE to delegate to state and local law enforcement officers the ability to perform certain functions of an immigration officer. Once a suspect is arrested for a crime, a trained corrections officer can access an ICE database to see more information about their immigration status and may then detain the person for up to 48 hours if ICE chooses to pick them up for deportation.",
      "Supporters of the program argue that it does not allow local officers to round up undocumented immigrants on the streets, and that any enforcement is done within an agency\u2019s jail or detention center once a suspect has been arrested for other charges. According to ICE, as of May 2024, law enforcement agencies in 21 states participated in the program.",
      "Harford County, Maryland, Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler is a proponent of the program, saying he believes that local law enforcement should partner with ICE to help enforce immigration laws. He also pushed back against criticism that it would lead to undocumented immigrants being unfairly targeted.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t stopping people on the street \u2014 saying \u2018show me your papers,\u2019\u201d Gahler said, \u201cIf they\u2019re brought in \u2014 they\u2019re arrested for something that they have committed, an act they\u2019ve committed against the citizens of our community. And at that point, they\u2019re held accountable for the action of being in the country illegally.\u201d",
      "Gahler is no stranger to being at the center of the country\u2019s immigration debate. He has made several trips to the southern border \u2014 and worked on a high-profile murder case in his county allegedly involving an undocumented immigrant.",
      "Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was reported missing on Aug. 5, 2023, and her body was found the following day off a popular running trail. Victor Martinez Hernandez, an El Salvador native, was arrested after a 10-month nationwide manhunt. He was extradited to Maryland, where he\u2019s been charged with first-degree murder and rape.",
      "The victim's mother, Patty Morin, remembers when she first learned the suspect was undocumented.",
      "\u201cI was actually very angry,\u201d she said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cI thought we had laws in place for this type of thing. \u2026 But as information became more and more available, I realized that somehow something went wrong somewhere.\u201d",
      "Another supporter of the 287(g) program is Samuel Page, the sheriff of Rockingham County, North Carolina. It\u2019s a much more rural area than Mecklenburg County, where controversy over the program erupted in 2018 when a new sheriff cut ties with it. Page said his county signed up for the program in 2020 and put about a dozen corrections officers through the training. He said there have been fewer requests for ICE detainers during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cWhen President Biden came in, he ended a lot of those programs that were good to protect the American people,\u201d Page said. \u201cWe got to draw the line and say the rule of law is going to matter in America.\u201d",
      "The 287(g) program has long been controversial. Democrats have moved to cancel agreements in various parts of the country. The American Civil Liberties Union strongly opposes the program and argues it amounts to racial profiling while instilling fear in immigrant communities. The Maryland chapter of the ACLU has said that local police officers are \u201cwholly unprepared\u201d to act as immigration agents.",
      "\u201cThis hurts those families,\u201d said Todd Shulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigrant advocacy group. \u201cThis leads to worse public safety outcomes. It erodes a sense of trust in communities and hurts the economy.\u201d",
      "Even within ICE, there is debate about \u201cwhether the juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d according to Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff. It may be effective for large cities, he said, where having trained corrections officers help with immigration enforcement inside jails might free up other ICE agents to search for immigrants with more serious criminal records on the streets. But in sparsely populated areas, the time and effort to train officers could be seen as inefficient.",
      "Other critics have also said the 287(g) program merely serves as a political messaging tool for conservative sheriffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign platform promised to require local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. But a growing number of Democrats are vowing to defy that. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance that prohibits the use of city resources in immigration enforcement.",
      "Elected officials in Massachusetts are already clashing with the Trump team over immigration. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said he\u2019d be willing to go to jail to stop efforts by the president-elect that he believed were illegal or wrong.",
      "It\u2019s all setting the stage for a clash after inauguration.",
      "\u201cLocal and state officials on the frontlines of the Harris-Biden border invasion have been suffering for four years and are eager for President Trump to return to the Oval Office,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cOn day one, President Trump will marshal every lever of power to secure the border, protect their communities, and launch the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrant criminals in history.\u201d",
      "As for the 287(g) program, corrections officers in Harford County, Maryland, are preparing for changes next year with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI believe we\u2019re going to be very busy,\u201d said Sgt. Christopher Crespo. The program \u201chas been very effective. \u2026 The last thing you need to do is have someone in the street commit a murder and find out that they were here illegally.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 On his second go-round, Donald Trump wants an inauguration that is more broadly accepted and celebrated than eight years ago, when he squeaked past his opponent and took office as police fired pepper spray at protesters alarmed by his rise.",
      "He\u2019s hoping for fewer protests and \u201cless divisiveness\u201d this time, a person close to the president-elect told NBC News, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s thinking.",
      "In this year's election \u2014 unlike in 2016 \u2014 Trump won both the popular vote and a comfortable electoral college margin. Coming off those results, Trump believes there won't be the same sort of stigma attached to his presidency as was the case back then, the person said.",
      "That's Trump's hope. For now, his advisers are beginning work on an inauguration unlike anything the U.S. has seen since the late 19th century, when Grover Cleveland was the first to reclaim the White House four years after voters had thrown him out.",
      "Aides have come up with a logo for the inaugural ceremony on Jan. 20 and have built a website that will soon go live, a person familiar with the planning said.",
      "They've been booking blocks of hotel rooms and workshopping themes for a swearing-in that is surrounded by a slew of parties, luncheons and, finally, a parade ending at a White House reviewing stand that is now under construction. (Some D.C. residents have been trying to encourage Airbnb hosts not to rent out our their properties during the inauguration \u2014 or raise the prices and donate the funds to liberal groups, according to The Washington Post.)",
      "A women\u2019s march is also scheduled around Trump\u2019s swearing-in, though it may be a smaller than the massive demonstration that took place in 2017 around the country.",
      "One of the co-chairs of that march, Linda Sarsour, said she believes the political environment is more dangerous now for women to openly protest Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cWe just don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to have people in Washington, D.C., during the same weekend when we have an influx of MAGA in Washington,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe need to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much work remains in Trump's planning. His advisers haven\u2019t yet settled on the number of inaugural balls that will take place. (In 2017, he and his wife, Melania, danced at three official balls.) While Trump will again use a presidential inaugural committee to raise money, his team has not yet said whether the operation will accept donations from corporations or lobbyists.",
      "Trump\u2019s first inauguration raised a record-shattering $107 million, while also spawning accusations of sloppy bookkeeping and culminating in a $750,000 legal settlement over where the money went.",
      "Trump will take office after a four-year hiatus, making the occasion a rare blend of old and new. When he was inaugurated the first time, the nation knew a lot about Trump the man, but little about how he\u2019d govern.",
      "Now, Americans have a better idea of how he\u2019ll govern, but little understanding of how his four years in exile might have altered his thinking and priorities. Is he bent on retribution, as he has suggested at times? Or was he sincere when he said in his victory speech that his party is about \u201cinclusion\u201d?",
      "The inaugural will set a tone that may offer clues as to how he wants to lead. Trump will deliver a set speech, of course, but he'll also presumably escort outgoing President Joe Biden to a waiting helicopter after the ceremony.",
      "That simple and traditional gesture, rooted in the peaceful transfer of power, takes on added meaning given that Trump skipped Biden's swearing-in after mounting an unsuccessful bid to overturn the result base on false claims that the election was stolen.",
      "One aim of the inaugural planners is to put workaday Americans front-and-center during the events, as opposed to celebrity guests, the person familiar with the planning said.",
      "The celebrities Trump has drawn to his side are mostly 20th century figures who were prominent when he came of age as a Manhattan real estate developer. Trump was heartened to see Sylvester Stallone, star of the \u201cRocky\u201d franchise, appear with him during an event at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this month, the person close to him said.",
      "Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, now 71, spoke at the Republican nominating convention in Milwaukee over the summer and plans to attend the inauguration, according to a spokesman for Real American Beer \u2014 whose motto is \u201cOne Nation, Under Beer\u201d \u2014 an adult beverage company that Hogan founded.",
      "The singer Lee Greenwood also will attend and, if asked, will perform as well, a spokesman for him said. Greenwood wrote the song that has become an anthem of Trump\u2019s campaign: \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d",
      "Biden and his wife, Jill, will also appear on the inaugural stage. Unclear is whether Hillary Clinton plans to be there. A spokesman for Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 race, declined comment.",
      "A variable out of Trump\u2019s control is the size of the crowd that will gather on the National Mall to watch the ceremony.",
      "This matters to him. A lot.",
      "His last inaugural sparked a prolonged back-and-forth over the number of people who came to watch. Photos showed that Barack Obama drew more people to his 2009 swearing-in. Always attuned to ratings, Trump balked at the implication that Obama had drawn the bigger crowd.",
      "His White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, wrote in a memoir that Trump had called him the next morning to tell him about a TV news segment he had seen that compared the two audiences eight years apart.",
      "\u201cThe president was clear: this needed to be addressed \u2014 now,\u201d Spicer wrote. That touched off a contentious exchange in the White House press briefing room over what seemed a triviality on the first full day of a new presidency: crowd size.",
      "Chairing the inaugural are Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator from Georgia, and Steven Witkoff, a real estate investor.",
      "One test will be their stewardship of the private donations pouring in.",
      "In one instance in 2017, Trump\u2019s inaugural committee logged a $25,000 donation from someone named Katherine Johnson, listing the address as NASA headquarters.",
      "That seemed to be a reference to the space agency\u2019s famed mathematician, but the Katherine Johnson who was celebrated in a 2016 movie was then in her 90s (she died in 2020 at 101). She no longer worked at NASA and, according to her family, had given Trump no such donation.",
      "\u201cWhat you would hope the transition team would learn from that experience is you actually have to keep accurate records of where you got the money for the inauguration,\u201d said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at Stetson University law school and author of the book, \u201cCorporatocracy.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the attorney general in Washington, D.C., announced a settlement in which Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and the Trump Organization paid a total of $750,000 to resolve a case stemming from inauguration spending.",
      "The attorney general, Karl Racine, had alleged that the inauguration committee had \u201cimproperly\u201d overpaid for events at what was then the Trump International Hotel in Washington. (In the settlement, the defendants disputed the allegations and denied any wrongdoing.)",
      "\u201cNo one is above the law \u2014 not even a president,\u201d Racine said at the time."

    "story": [
      "The Oscars. The Met Gala. The Olympics. Wearing a wardrobe's worth of pink and green ensembles, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo have gone far and wide to promote the new \"Wicked\" movie. But one interview the pair gave with Out magazine appeared to unexpectedly defy gravity.",
      "In a clip of the filmed conversation, journalist Tracy E. Gilchrist told the \"Wicked\" stars about an observation she's made among queer fans regarding the Broadway-musical-turned-film's signature song: \"I've seen this week people are taking the lyrics of 'Defying Gravity' and really holding space with that and feeling power in that.\"",
      "\"I didn't know that was happening,\" Erivo replied.",
      "\"I've seen it, yeah,\" Gilchrist confirmed.",
      "\"That\u2019s really powerful,\" Erivo said softly. \"That\u2019s what I wanted.\"",
      "After a brief pause, Erivo repeated: \"I didn't know that was happening.\"",
      "Gilchrist shrugged and gently explained: \"I\u2019ve seen it on a couple of posts. I don\u2019t know how widespread it is, but you know I am in queer media.\"",
      "Grande said nothing, but nodded approvingly and reached over to hold Erivo's pointer finger, which she grasped throughout the course of the exchange. A somber string rendition of the song played softly over the video of the, at times, socially fragile interaction.",
      "The clip has been seen over 2 million times on Instagram since the LGBTQ magazine posted it last week. Somewhat inexplicably, it has elicited a tsunami of memes on social media.",
      "In a meme he posted to X on Friday, Vanity Fair staff writer Chris Murphy poked fun at both the viral interview and internet punching bag Carrie Bradshaw, the main character of the hit HBO show \"Sex and the City.\"",
      "The meme shows the tragically romantic Bradshaw, a writer, typing on her laptop and reads: \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but wonder... if Big could hold space for the lyrics of Defying Gravity, why couldn\u2019t he hold space for me?\u201d",
      "The official X accounts for Merriam-Webster and New York City\u2019s Empire State Building also weighed in on the matter.",
      "\"The 103rd floor of the Empire State Building was originally built to hold space for the lyrics of Defying Gravity,\" the account for the iconic art deco building posted Saturday. (The building only has 102 floors.)",
      "And on Sunday, the New York City Gay Men\u2019s Chorus shared a video on TikTok and Instagram, showing dozens of its members singing and harmonizing to what appears to be a song made out of quotes from the interview.",
      "\u201cReally holding space with that and feeling power in that. Really holding space with that and feeling power in that,\u201d the men sang. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it on a couple of posts, I don\u2019t know how widespread it is, but you know I am in queer media.\u201d",
      "The viral interview managed to also grab the attention of traditional media.",
      "ABC News' \"The View\" dedicated an entire panel Tuesday to dissecting the viral clip and the cultural moment it is arguably spawning.",
      "\u201cAre we supposed to hold space for Trump supporters now?\u201d co-host Joy Behar joked.",
      "Gilchrist said in an interview that she was shocked by the response.",
      "\"In a meeting, someone said that I am a meme now, and I was like, 'What?' So, I had no idea,\" she said. Later, \"I was at lunch with a friend and my phone, everything just started blowing up.\"",
      "Within the last week, search interest for \"holding space\" was beating out the newly declared word of the year \"demure,\" according to Google Trends. Gilchrist said the term originated from a friend.",
      "\u201cFor me, \u2018holding space\u2019 means being in the moment, taking time to really listen, to be in a conversation,\u201d Gilchrist said. \u201cThe irony is, to me, \u2018holding space\u2019 is not being immersed in the internet.\u201d",
      "Gilchrist said she believes the viral moment was a result of having built a rapport with Erivo from a prior story this year and because it occurred in the days after the election.",
      "\"She knew what I meant. Ariana knew what I meant,\" Gilchrist said. \"And I think because it was in the wake of the election, it was serious.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because that\u2019s kind of the definition of high camp. Camp is sincere. Real camp is sincere,\u201d Gilchrist added. \u201cIt\u2019s campy the way it all happened and it\u2019s authentic.\u201d",
      "Neither Grande nor Erivo has commented on the viral interview publicly. However, Grande sent Out a laughing emoji in response to an Instagram story the magazine posted about the viral interview, Gilchrist said.",
      "The musical \"Wicked\" hit Broadway in 2003 and was an adaptation of the 1995\u00a0Gregory Maguire\u00a0novel\u00a0\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" which was based off of\u00a0L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel\u00a0and later film \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\"",
      "The film adaptation of \"Wicked\" by Universal Pictures was made in two parts, with the first part having premiered Friday and the second part to be released in November of next year. (Comcast is the parent company of both NBC News and Universal Pictures.)",
      "Gilchrist said that \"Wicked\" resonates with queer people because the story of Erivo's green-skinned character, Elphaba, \"is the story of an 'other,' someone who is treated differently because of something that is innate.\"",
      "The song \"Defying Gravity\" is about a decision facing Elphaba to either join forces with Oz's tyrannical Wizard or follow her heart and challenge authority. In the finale of part one, fans find out whether Elphaba decides to \"hold space\" for her values."

    "title": "EV tax credits could soon vanish. Is now the time to buy?",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:28:55 GMT",
    "summary": "California plans to blunt any GOP efforts to scrap U.S. tax rebates for electric vehicles. But with uncertainty ahead, experts say current savings may not last.",
    "story": [
      "California is already looking to head off any moves by President-elect Donald Trump to slash electric vehicle subsidies \u2014 the latest sign of uncertainty for EVs next year that some analysts say prospective buyers should think about now.",
      "\u201cThe road ahead in 2025 is looking pretty bumpy for EVs,\u201d said Jay Turner, an environmental studies professor at Wellesley College who studies the market. He called California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s announcement Monday that the state would fill the gap if the incoming administration scraps existing federal EV tax rebates \u201cgood news for Californians.\u201d",
      "Some states, including Colorado and Massachusetts, already offer substantial support that EV buyers can combine with those on offer from the federal government, Turner noted. But after California\u2019s own incentives expired last year, the state\u2019s new ultimatum would effectively replace the tax credits (of $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones) that the Biden administration introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act, should a Republican-controlled White House and Congress quash that aid.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not turning back on a clean transportation future \u2014 we\u2019re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don\u2019t pollute,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump has criticized tough emissions standards and is likely to renew a fight with California over the matter. He also indicated on the campaign trail that he\u2019d consider eliminating the EV rebates, saying, \u201cTax credits and tax incentives are not generally a very good thing.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team didn\u2019t outline specific plans but said he\u2019d be focused on \u201cstopping attacks on gas-powered cars\u201d in his new term. \u201cPresident Trump will support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars AND electric vehicles,\u201d spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "EV sales are continuing to break records, but uptake this year has been slower than expected, leaving many automakers to temper their plans for the electric transition.",
      "In the meantime, subsidies like those provided under the IRA have helped buoy the market. Year-to-date sales of new EVs reached 1 million units in October, according to Cox Automotive, with incentives comprising at least 13.7% of the average transaction price. Used EV sales were up 63.5% year-to-date, highlighting another problem: Manufacturers are still trying to figure out how many EVs to produce to meet demand without overshooting it, leaving some dealerships with a glut of clean-energy cars.",
      "U.S. automakers want the consumer incentives largely intact, said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. But so far, industry experts see \u201cvirtually no indication\u201d that Trump and Republican lawmakers want to leave the IRA\u2019s rebate program alone.",
      "\u201cWe know that of the options available, the most likely is it\u2019s going away. The only question is how soon, how much and what should you do about it?\u201d Drury said.",
      "The answer could vary by prospective buyers\u2019 locations and budgets, but anyone who\u2019s been eyeing an EV lately should consider acting soon, he said. Even without knowing what the Trump administration and Congress may do, manufacturers will likely produce fewer EVs next year to better sync up with demand, Drury said, which would likely translate into fewer discounts.",
      "And right now, \u201cit\u2019s model-year sell-down time,\u201d he noted. That means buyers can combine existing tax credits with the deep discounts on offer over the next three months. Drury estimated at least 4 out of 5 EVs on dealers\u2019 lots right now are 2024 models.",
      "\u201cIf I were a buyer, I\u2019d move before the end of year,\u201d Turner said. Even if the credits aren\u2019t repealed by Congress, the Trump White House \u201ccould sharply limit which EVs are eligible for the tax credit through administrative action,\u201d he said, such as tightening rules around foreign battery-sourcing.",
      "One wild card in the next leg of the EV wars: tariffs, which Trump threatened Monday to increase on goods from China, Mexico and Canada on his first day in office, which would likely drive up car prices.",
      "Another question mark surrounds Tesla. The company\u2019s centibillionaire CEO, Elon Musk, played an outsize role in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and is slated to help run a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d a role that has the potential to pose unparalleled conflicts of interest. Musk has previously called to \u201ctake away the subsidies\u201d for EVs, saying, \u201cIt will only help Tesla.\u201d The automaker\u2019s stock has soared since Trump\u2019s victory as investors bet on the company benefiting after he takes office.",
      "Hours after Newsom announced his proposal Monday, Bloomberg News reported that his office planned to exclude Teslas from any state rebate program, citing an idea to limit the proposed aid based on automakers\u2019 EV market shares. A spokesperson for the governor\u2019s office told NBC News that \u201cunder a potential market cap, and depending on what the cap is, there\u2019s a possibility that Tesla and other automakers could be excluded\u201d but cautioned that the idea \u201cis subject to negotiation with the legislature\u201d and \u201cwould be intended to foster market competition.\u201d",
      "Drury said there\u2019s reason to believe Musk is right to envision his company faring comparatively well if the federal credit goes away.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt every automaker other than Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax credit is meant to utilize adoption, to help convince people this is the thing to do.\u201d While rivals are eating into Tesla\u2019s market share, the EV-only automaker still dominates the U.S. market, and the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t need that with their customer base right there,\u201d Drury said of the incentive.",
      "For those who might be more risk-averse, he suggests leasing an EV instead.",
      "The current federal tax credit also applies to leases, and some dealerships are exploiting a loophole that allows EV lessees to qualify for the full $7,500 credit without meeting income or manufacturer requirements. In many cases, dealers will apply those savings directly to the term of the lease, Drury said, effectively lowering customers\u2019 monthly payments.",
      "In a recent Edmunds analysis of mid-priced vehicles leased this year, the average monthly payment for EVs when factoring in tax credits was $428, far lower than the $572 for vehicles with gas engines. For a 36-month lease, that\u2019s more than $5,000 in average savings.",
      "\u201cIf the tax credit goes away and it\u2019s a significant amount that\u2019s being utilized by dealers, you\u2019ll have them rather upset for a while,\u201d Drury said. \u201cSome will say, \u2018Well, good, nobody was buying them.\u2019 But you\u2019re not going to have more happy dealers.\u201d",
      "Buyers who act before any such changes, however, may have reason to smile in retrospect."

      "The planned \u201cMake Amazon Pay\u201d demonstrations are intended to \u201chold Amazon accountable for labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy,\u201d according to the initiative\u2019s organizers, the Switzerland-based labor federation UNI Global Union and the grassroots activist group Progressive International.",
      "\u201cWe stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all. \u2018Make Amazon Pay Day\u2019 is becoming a global act of resistance against Amazon\u2019s abuse of power,\u201d said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union.",
      "In a statement, Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said: \u201cThese groups represent a variety of interests, and while we\u2019re always listening and looking at ways to improve, we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and engaging, safe work experience we provide our teams.\u201d",
      "The two strike organizers said unions and allied groups are planning to hold demonstrations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Japan, Brazil, Turkey and other nations. In at least six German towns, thousands of Amazon workers are set to strike. In New Delhi, hundreds of Amazon workers are expected to rally to demand fair treatment.",
      "The planned \u201cglobal day of resistance\u201d comes as labor leaders around the world feel increasingly emboldened to take on large corporations in an era of income inequality. The International Labour Organization, an arm of the United Nations, found that post-pandemic inflation and the rising cost of living have been eroding the real value of minimum wages in many countries.",
      "In recent years, American labor activists have increasingly trained their ire on Amazon and the shopping behemoth\u2019s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos. The results have been mixed. In early 2022, an Amazon facility in Staten Island, New York, became the first company warehouse to vote to form a union. But similar union drives in Alabama and at least two others in New York failed.",
      "It was not immediately clear how many Amazon workers in the U.S. would participate in the announced demonstrations against the Seattle-based company, one of the leading e-commerce and digital technology firms in the world.",
      "\u201cAmazon is everywhere, but so are we,\u201d said Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla, co-general coordinator of Progressive International. \u201cBy uniting our movements across borders, we can not only force Amazon to change its ways, but lay the foundations of a world that prioritizes human dignity, not Jeff Bezos\u2019 bank balance.\u201d",
      "UNI Global Union and Progressive International said that this is the fifth year of \u201cMake Amazon Pay\u201d activities. In previous years, according to the groups, thousands of workers went on strike at company facilities in Germany, France, Spain, the U.K. and Italy."

      "Federal Reserve officials expressed confidence that inflation is easing and the labor market is strong, allowing for further interest rate cuts albeit at a gradual pace, according to minutes from the November meeting released Tuesday.",
      "The meeting summary contained multiple statements indicating that officials are comfortable with the pace of inflation, even though by most measures it remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.",
      "With that in mind, and with conviction that the jobs picture is still fairly solid, Federal Open Market Committee members indicated that further rate cuts likely will happen, though they did not specify when and to what degree.",
      "\u201cIn discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time,\u201d the minutes said.",
      "The FOMC voted unanimously at the meeting to take down its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%. Markets expect the Fed could cut again in December, though conviction has waned among concerns that President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s plans for tariffs could stoke inflation higher.",
      "The meeting concluded two days after the contentious presidential election campaign resulted in the Republican emerging as the victor and set to begin serving his second term in January.",
      "There was no mention of the election in the minutes, save for a staff notation that stock market volatility rose before the Nov. 5 results and fell after. There also was no discussion of the implications of fiscal policy, despite anticipation that Trump\u2019s plans, which also include lower taxes and aggressive deregulation, could have substantial economic impacts.",
      "However, members did note a general level of uncertainty about how conditions are evolving. In addition, they expressed uncertainty over where the rate cuts would need to stop before the Fed hit a \u201cneutral\u201d interest rate that neither boosts nor restrains growth.",
      "\u201cMany participants observed that uncertainties concerning the level of the neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually,\u201d the minutes said.",
      "Conflicting signals on inflation and the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s policies have caused traders to scale back their outlook for interest rate cuts ahead. The market-implied probability of a rate trim in December has drifted below 60%, with an expectation of just three-quarters of a percentage point in reductions through the end of the 2025.",
      "Committee members appeared to spend much of the meeting talking about progress on inflation and a generally stable economic outlook.",
      "Policymakers in recent days have expressed confidence that current inflation readings are being boosted by shelter cost increases that are expected to slow as the pace of rent rises eases and makes its way through the data.",
      "\u201cAlmost all participants judged that, though month-to-month movements would remain volatile, incoming data generally remained consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent,\u201d the document said.",
      "\u201cParticipants cited various factors likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including waning business pricing power, the Committee\u2019s still-restrictive monetary policy stance, and well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations,\u201d it added.",
      "Policymakers had been expressing concern about the labor market. Nonfarm payrolls rose only 12,000 in October, though the meager gain has been attributed primarily to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.",
      "Officials indicated that the state of the labor market is generally solid.",
      "\u201cParticipants generally noted \u2026 that there was no sign of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions, with layoffs remaining low,\u201d the minutes said.",

      "Across the country, high-quality, accessible and affordable early child care can be difficult to find.",
      "A growing\u00a0program in Alabama aims to ease that problem by expanding the number of at-home day care centers, in a move its creator believes will provide more care options to stressed parents and also give the workforce a boost.",
      "\u201cAlabama has a large workforce and a large workforce need at the same time,\u201d said Holly Glasgow, director of child development at Shelton State Community College in Tuscaloosa. \u201cAnd we know that child care is one of those things that is often a barrier.\u201d",
      "Glasgow is leading 3by3, a program run out of Shelton State that aims to bring more at-home day care centers to local families.",
      "There are fewer than 50 licensed child care centers in Tuscaloosa County, and Glasgow estimates that there are about 3,000 child care spots available for the more than 12,000 kids under the age of 5.",
      "\u201cWe realized pretty quickly that regardless of how much money they were able to raise, it would not be enough to really build enough centers across our state to be able to effectively change what we have in terms of the number of child care slots,\u201d Glasgow said.",
      "\u201cBut what we could do instead was really focus on family child care homes. They give us the ability to kind of meet the needs of the workforce a little bit differently. They give us the opportunity to add child care in a family setting,\u201d she added.",
      "The lack of affordable, quality child care has bedeviled parents and employers across the country for several years, even becoming a talking point in this year\u2019s presidential election. It has played a central role in discussions about the economy since the pandemic, when many child care centers closed and some parents could not return to work. According to the Census Bureau, 35% of parents with children under age 5 have no formal child care arrangements.",
      "In the Tuscaloosa area, where major employers include manufacturing facilities that operate 24 hours a day, it can be challenging to find child care during off-hours.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine the shortage with shift-based work, one thing becomes clear: Tuscaloosa County needs more child care for its families \u2014 and part of that care at night,\u201d the program\u2019s website says.",
      "The 3by3 program matches people who want to start at-home day cares with grants and partner organizations to help cover startup costs, one of the greatest barriers to entry for people who want to start an at-home day care.",
      "The participants also receive about 100 hours of training, learning everything from social media marketing to the required alterations they must make to their homes.",
      "Glasgow assists in making sure each house is up to code, visiting often and stocking each one with toys, books, carbon monoxide alarms, fire extinguishers, outlet covers and more.",
      "Most of these homes have the capacity to care for three to six children.",
      "The program, which launched earlier this year, has helped to set up 19 at-home day cares, each with three to six children. The operators keep all of their profits.",
      "Among them is Lynnette Washington, a member of the inaugural 3by3 program cohort who started a home day care that her daughter can also attend.",
      "\u201cTo be able to help kids and parents and stuff like that, because everybody got to work, and to be able to help, that\u2019s an awesome feeling,\u201d she said.",
      "Receiving quality child care at a young age can improve numerous outcomes for children, said Steve Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research.",
      "\u201cWe know that kids who don\u2019t get these investments can be 18 months behind when they start school. It\u2019s very difficult to ever catch up,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "\u201cTheir language, literacy and math skills, we set the foundation for all of that. That\u2019s so important for the rest of their lives,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we know that if we do this well, kids will be more likely to go on to higher education and to be more productive and successful. And actually they\u2019ll live longer lives, healthier because of this.\u201d",
      "Glasgow said she has big dreams for 3by3.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Alabama is where we will stop. I do think going forward, we\u2019ll be able to provide a model for other states,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEarly care and early education is pivotal,\u201d Glasgow added. \u201cWe have to make it better. And it\u2019s much easier to spend the money doing it better at the beginning than to remediate the issues at the end. By leaps and bounds.\u201d"

      "\u201cAs far as my future goes, I haven\u2019t told anybody in my life that I want to play in 2025 and not on the Jets,\u201d Rodgers said on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" addressing rumors he would like to play elsewhere.",
      "He then added: \u201cI\u2019m not jumping off ship. ... I don\u2019t even know if I want to play yet, but New York would be my first option.\u201d",
      "Rodgers\u2019s future both in the NFL and with New York has been called into question amid his own and the team\u2019s struggles so far this season.",
      "The three-time MVP is averaging the fewest yards per attempt of his career in 2024, with his worst passer rating since he became a full-time starter in 2008. And the Jets are 3-8, having lost seven of their last eight games.",
      "On Nov. 23, The Athletic\u2019s Diana Russini reported her \u201cunderstanding\u201d was that Rodgers wanted to play again next season, but not with New York.",
      "Rodgers said his decision would be based in part on who is coaching the team and leading the front office next year. The Jets fired head coach Robert Saleh in October, and then fired general manager Joe Douglas this month.",
      "New York traded for Rodgers before the 2023 season, but his tenure has been marked by disappointment.",
      "He played only four snaps last season before tearing his Achilles, causing him to miss the rest of the year. In June, Rodgers was fined for an \u201cunexcused absence\u201d after he skipped a mandatory practice for a planned trip to Egypt. And through 11 games this season, the Jets are in 12th place in the AFC.",
      "New York owes Rodgers $23.5 million next season. If the Jets were to cut or trade Rodgers after the season, it would cost them $25.5 million against the salary cap. If the quarterback is cut or traded after June 1, New York would gain $9.5 million in cap space.",
      "The Jets next play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks."

      "Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield filed a federal lawsuit against a financial firm owned by his father, James Mayfield, accusing the company of failing to pay back nearly $12 million taken without his authorization.",
      "The 29-year-old NFL star filed the civil lawsuit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for $11.7 million.",
      "The suit alleges that from 2018 to 2021, Camwood Capital Management Group transferred more than $12 million from Mayfield and his wife \"without his authorization, proper documentation, or adequate accounting of the transactions\" to a subsidiary called Texas Contract Manufacturing Group.",
      "Camwood allegedly used the money \"however they desired,\" the suit says, including to fund acquisitions or to cover general operating expenses.",
      "\"For the period of time that Plaintiffs\u2019 funds were being funneled to Defendants, Plaintiffs were the primary source of funding and capitalization for Defendants. In exchange, Plaintiffs received nothing,\" the suit says.",
      "When Mayfield found out and questioned the company about it, Camwood allegedly avoided Mayfield's inquiries and \"invented fictional explanations for their actions,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Camwood did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "NBC affiliate WFLA-TV of Tampa reported that Camwood is owned by James Mayfield, and that his son, Matt Mayfield \u2014 Baker Mayfield's brother \u2014 has a stake in it.",
      "Attempts to reach James Mayfield and Matt Mayfield were unsuccessful. They are not named as defendants, but are listed in the lawsuit as members of the company.",
      "In January, Baker Mayfield and the company entered into a settlement. Under the agreement, Camwood was required to repay $11.7 million plus interest beginning Sept. 30, the lawsuit states. The company also had to refinance an existing loan to free up capital to repay Mayfield, as well as provide him access to their books and records, the suit says.",
      "The lawsuit, however, accuses Camwood of breaching the settlement agreement.",
      "\"It is now clear that Defendants had no intention of making Plaintiffs whole when they entered into the Settlement Agreement,\" the lawsuit states. \"To date, Camwood Capital has not repaid even one dollar under the Settlement Agreement, Defendants have failed to refinance their existing loan, and Defendants have not provided Plaintiffs with access to their books and records.\"",
      "The suit says that because Camwood has failed to follow through on the settlement agreement, Mayfield was left with no choice but to file a lawsuit."

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 23:17:39 GMT",
    "summary": "A controversial immigration program could help supply Trump with the manpower to carry out his mass deportation plans and spark a legal showdown.",
    "story": [
      "BEL AIR, Md. \u2014 As President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration solidifies its plan for mass deportations, local law enforcement agencies are preparing to ramp up a controversial program that allows them to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The 287(g) program empowers state and local law enforcement officers to help enforce federal immigration law and will likely be one of the ways the new administration bolsters its manpower as it seeks to launch what it calls the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. But it also may also be a flashpoint for a legal showdown that\u2019s brewing as Inauguration Day draws closer.",
      "Tom Homan, who will serve as Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d visited Texas Tuesday to tout the forthcoming administration\u2019s plans for mass deportations.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting until January,\u201d Homan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a plan in place and secure this nation.\u201d",
      "Homan, the former acting ICE director during Trump\u2019s first term, has promised to \u201ctake the handcuffs off ICE.\u201d",
      "The 287(g) program was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996 under then-President Bill Clinton. It authorizes ICE to delegate to state and local law enforcement officers the ability to perform certain functions of an immigration officer. Once a suspect is arrested for a crime, a trained corrections officer can access an ICE database to see more information about their immigration status and may then detain the person for up to 48 hours if ICE chooses to pick them up for deportation.",
      "Supporters of the program argue that it does not allow local officers to round up undocumented immigrants on the streets, and that any enforcement is done within an agency\u2019s jail or detention center once a suspect has been arrested for other charges. According to ICE, as of May 2024, law enforcement agencies in 21 states participated in the program.",
      "Harford County, Maryland, Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler is a proponent of the program, saying he believes that local law enforcement should partner with ICE to help enforce immigration laws. He also pushed back against criticism that it would lead to undocumented immigrants being unfairly targeted.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t stopping people on the street \u2014 saying \u2018show me your papers,\u2019\u201d Gahler said, \u201cIf they\u2019re brought in \u2014 they\u2019re arrested for something that they have committed, an act they\u2019ve committed against the citizens of our community. And at that point, they\u2019re held accountable for the action of being in the country illegally.\u201d",
      "Gahler is no stranger to being at the center of the country\u2019s immigration debate. He has made several trips to the southern border \u2014 and worked on a high-profile murder case in his county allegedly involving an undocumented immigrant.",
      "Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was reported missing on Aug. 5, 2023, and her body was found the following day off a popular running trail. Victor Martinez Hernandez, an El Salvador native, was arrested after a 10-month nationwide manhunt. He was extradited to Maryland, where he\u2019s been charged with first-degree murder and rape.",
      "The victim's mother, Patty Morin, remembers when she first learned the suspect was undocumented.",
      "\u201cI was actually very angry,\u201d she said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cI thought we had laws in place for this type of thing. \u2026 But as information became more and more available, I realized that somehow something went wrong somewhere.\u201d",
      "Another supporter of the 287(g) program is Samuel Page, the sheriff of Rockingham County, North Carolina. It\u2019s a much more rural area than Mecklenburg County, where controversy over the program erupted in 2018 when a new sheriff cut ties with it. Page said his county signed up for the program in 2020 and put about a dozen corrections officers through the training. He said there have been fewer requests for ICE detainers during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cWhen President Biden came in, he ended a lot of those programs that were good to protect the American people,\u201d Page said. \u201cWe got to draw the line and say the rule of law is going to matter in America.\u201d",
      "The 287(g) program has long been controversial. Democrats have moved to cancel agreements in various parts of the country. The American Civil Liberties Union strongly opposes the program and argues it amounts to racial profiling while instilling fear in immigrant communities. The Maryland chapter of the ACLU has said that local police officers are \u201cwholly unprepared\u201d to act as immigration agents.",
      "\u201cThis hurts those families,\u201d said Todd Shulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigrant advocacy group. \u201cThis leads to worse public safety outcomes. It erodes a sense of trust in communities and hurts the economy.\u201d",
      "Even within ICE, there is debate about \u201cwhether the juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d according to Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff. It may be effective for large cities, he said, where having trained corrections officers help with immigration enforcement inside jails might free up other ICE agents to search for immigrants with more serious criminal records on the streets. But in sparsely populated areas, the time and effort to train officers could be seen as inefficient.",
      "Other critics have also said the 287(g) program merely serves as a political messaging tool for conservative sheriffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign platform promised to require local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. But a growing number of Democrats are vowing to defy that. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance that prohibits the use of city resources in immigration enforcement.",
      "Elected officials in Massachusetts are already clashing with the Trump team over immigration. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said he\u2019d be willing to go to jail to stop efforts by the president-elect that he believed were illegal or wrong.",
      "It\u2019s all setting the stage for a clash after inauguration.",
      "\u201cLocal and state officials on the frontlines of the Harris-Biden border invasion have been suffering for four years and are eager for President Trump to return to the Oval Office,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cOn day one, President Trump will marshal every lever of power to secure the border, protect their communities, and launch the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrant criminals in history.\u201d",
      "As for the 287(g) program, corrections officers in Harford County, Maryland, are preparing for changes next year with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI believe we\u2019re going to be very busy,\u201d said Sgt. Christopher Crespo. The program \u201chas been very effective. \u2026 The last thing you need to do is have someone in the street commit a murder and find out that they were here illegally.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:43:31 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Wicked's\" director and costume designer say why Dorothy's ruby red slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" are silver in \"Wicked.\"",
    "story": [
      "The ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d became nearly as iconic as the film itself. So why were the slippers silver in \u201cWicked\u201d?",
      "Some sharp-eyed fans noticed the change in the film adaptation of the Broadway show starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "And as it turns out, the choice to include the silver slippers was actually staying true to the original source text: In L. Frank Baum\u2019s book \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d the magic slippers were, in fact, silver.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ruby,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d costume designer Paul Tazewell said in an interview with People. \u201cIn the book, they were these odd little silver boots.\u201d",
      "Tazewell explained he took what happened in Maguire\u2019s novel as a starting point for his creation that ended up in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked\u201d the book, Nessarose is described as wearing iridescent shoes that seem to \u201cpulse with hundreds of reflections and refractions.\u201d Glinda later enchants the shoes to help Nessarose walk (though in the Broadway play, Elphaba is the one to cast the spell).",
      "Marissa Bode, who plays Nessarose in \u201cWicked,\u201d ultimately wears silver heels with swirls and sparkles in the film, paying homage to the original while also wearing something unique to the film, Tazewell said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of Cinderella and the glass slipper, and then it\u2019s like how we make shoes a myth and how we\u2019ve indulged them into our fantasy fairytale storytelling,\u201d he said.",
      "In the 1939 film, the move from silver to sparkly red was a stylistic change made to emphasize the contrast between the yellow brick road and Dorothy\u2019s gorgeous heels.",
      "\u201cFor the Technicolor movie, costumers created ruby red shoes to show up more vividly against the yellow-brick road,\u201d reads the Smithsonian description of a pair of the ruby slippers used in the film and now housed in the museum in Washington, D.C. Garland wore several pairs when making \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d; another of them is currently up for auction.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu also weighed in on the change in an interview with Variety, when he was asked if it was true that MGM, which produced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d had the copyright for both the ruby slippers and the yellow brick road. (TODAY has not independently confirmed MGM\u2019s copyrights.)",
      "\u201cWe had boundaries of what we could reference or not. We never use the ruby slippers,\u201d Chu explained. \u201cNessa has on crystal slippers as in the Frank L. Baum book, Gregory Maguire book and the show.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t think the phrase \u2018yellow brick road\u2019 is copywritten, but definitely the shape of the road is. We couldn\u2019t do the spiral. We had to do a circle that continues to show it\u2019s not where the road ends.\u201d",
      "Some eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed an Easter egg paying homage to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when Glinda, played by Grande, briefly grabs a pair of sparkly red slippers while she\u2019s performing \u201cPopular\u201d in the film.",
      "She gifts the shoes to Elphaba, portrayed by Erivo, promising her she\u2019ll do everything she can to help make the future Wicked Witch of the West the most well-liked girl at Shiz.",
      "It turns out the creators of \u201cWicked\u201d have had the power to change the color of the iconic slippers all along, my dear."

      "It didn\u2019t take long for BookToker Asia Lin to understand that \u201cWicked,\u201d the book by Gregory Maguire, would be nothing like the musical she had first seen months earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was the first page,\u201d Lin tells TODAY.com, recalling a scene in which Dorothy and her companions discuss a rumor that Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, is intersex. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait. Hold on. This was not in the musical at all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Content creator Sara Ribeiro, who grew up listening to \u201cWicked\u201d in a musical theater-loving family, experienced a visceral shock while reading the book this year.",
      "\u201c(The book) ended up being a lot darker than I thought. I would say within the first 10 to 20%, my jaw was on the floor multiple times. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so \u2026 graphic,\u201d she says.",
      "With the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d debuting in theaters Nov. 22 (and the second and final part coming in 2025), TikTokers like Lin and Ribeiro are discovering the novel and sharing their experiences \u2014 from surprise to admiration \u2014 in real time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone warn me?\u201d Lin asks in a TikTok, echoing many other fans.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\u201d\u2014 a revisionist take on L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2014 originally published in 1995 and was followed by multiple other books to make a series. \u201cWicked\u201d the musical made its Broadway debut in 2003.",
      "The book and musical could be distilled to the same plot summary: Behold, the unexpected backstory of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda the Good. But the ways the book and musical convey its themes \u2014 like injustice, identity and friendship \u2014 is what distinguishes the two.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both about a young woman named Elphaba \u2014\u00a0but very different. The best way I can explain is like when your parents would hide vegetables in your food, and you wouldn\u2019t notice it. That\u2019s kind of what they did with the musical,\u201d Meredith Ammons, a content creator, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Whereas the musical hides its political message, Ammons says, the book is less subtle. She continues, \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a children\u2019s Bible for the first time versus reading the actual Bible for the first time, and how differently the tones are.\u201d",
      "The plight of Animals \u2014 conscious animals \u2014 takes center stage in the book, as does Elphaba\u2019s activism. Not so much a side character, the Wizard is rather a full-fledged dictatorial force committing massacres on the hinterlands of Oz and amassing power. While political allegory is the B-plot to \u201cWicked\u201d the musical, which centers on Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s friendship, it\u2019s the main storyline of Maguire\u2019s book.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d doesn\u2019t contain hallmarks from the musical, like a \u201cPopular\u201d-esque union between Glinda and Elphaba. But it takes detours the musical never would have space for \u2014 long explanations of religious sects, descriptions of terrain never mentioned in the musical and, well, quite a bit of R-rated content.",
      "For example: Elphaba bites off a midwife\u2019s finger as an newborn; her parents are involved in what is essentially a loving throuple with a Quadling man named Turtle Heart; Fiyero is a child groom married off at 7. Plus, there is inclusion of sexual assault, bestiality, murder, racism and politics.",
      "\u201cTrigger warning for everything. If you can think of it, it\u2019s in here,\u201d Eryn Kieffer, whose multipart read-along of \u201cWicked\u201d has amassed millions of views on TikTok, said in a video.",
      "Kieffer\u2019s series goes into all the graphic scenes she wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 like the Clock of the Time Dragon\u2019s puppet show or the Philosophy Club scenes, which have become shorthand for the book\u2019s surprising sexual detours.",
      "Among \u201cWicked\u201d fans, the book\u2019s content is divisive. Kieffer, on her end, said that the sexual content \u201cmuddles the plot.\u201d",
      "Ribeiro says she loves the \u201cshock value\u201d in the books and that the unexpected parts were her favorite to read \u2014 but ultimately took away from what she considered the \u201cpoint\u201d of the book.",
      "\u201cI think I was so distracted by all of the weird stuff that was going on that the political aspect of it was overshadowed,\u201d she says.",
      "Meanwhile, TikToker Aynsley Broom worries the focus on salaciousness takes attention from the book\u2019s more powerful parts about the rise of authoritarianism, which she sees as a \u201cmirror\u201d to the news. In the book, the Wizard of Oz is a despot who ostracizes and marginalizes entire classes of Ozians, not to mention Animals.",
      "\u201cI saw a video that was like, \u2018(The book) explicitly describes (Elphaba\u2019s) pubic hair.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Not really. The book just said it was purple and then moved on,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, the stuff people are focusing on is completely missing the message. The message needs to be talked more about than the shocking parts, which to me, weren\u2019t that shocking. Granted, I also read a lot of romance novels.\u201d",
      "In the book, she sees a more substantial offering than the musical \u2014 calling the former \u201ca great dinner\u201d and the latter \u201ccotton candy.\u201d",
      "Broom is among the readers who want a more faithful adaptation of Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d than another retelling of the more saccharine musical.\u00a0\u201cI think people want fluff, and we don\u2019t need more fluff,\u201d she says.",
      "Maguire, on his end, seems at peace with the adaptation. During a 2020 interview pegged to the book\u2019s anniversary, he said the musical\u2019s composer, Stephen Schwartz, presented his vision during a walk in Connecticut, and that he felt they were aligned \u2014 that Schwartz understood his book and the moral universe it\u2019s set in.",
      "\u201cI came home and I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to let this happen, I don\u2019t care about the money. This is far more in line with why I wrote the book than the movie scripts I\u2019ve read so far,\u2019\u201d he told Broadway World.",
      "Maguire said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the way Schwartz and book writer Winnie Holzman told the story.",
      "\u201cIt made efficient, economic and narrative sense for them to make the story choices that they chose to do, and I applaud it completely. The play is a little less subtle than the novel in some ways. And I wanted the novel to be more ambiguous because that\u2019s the nature of how I was trying to tell my story,\u201d he said.",
      "What TikTokers generally agree on, though, is that \u201cWicked\u201d the book is certainly not as kid-friendly as \u201cWicked\u201d the musical.",
      "Creators like TikToker Sal Currie are remarking on their experiences reading the books as kids, and giving a heads up to parents who might be persuaded by the newly rebranded cover.",
      "\u201cMy main thing is \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s not for kids. It\u2019s really, truly not for children. The musical is completely fine for kids. I would not say this book is at all,\u201d Kieffer tells TODAY.com.",
      "Ammons says her mom bought the book when she was a young child. She asked if she could read it.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And she said, \u2018You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older,\u2019\u201d she says. Ammons ultimately waited until she was 22 to read Maguire\u2019s novel. \u201cMy first reaction was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m glad I waited to read this, because my mom was right on this one,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Others think reading, and being bewildered by, \u201cWicked\u201d is a rite of passage: \u201cIt\u2019s a canon event for most \u2018Wicked\u2019 fans,\u201d one comment on Currie\u2019s post reads. \u201cWe must not interfere.\u201d"

      "\u201cI can think of no other family that has had that\u2019s been so brutalized by the American media and by the justice system than this family,\u201d he says.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about what happened to JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s mother, Patsy Ramsey, and what she said about her daughter over the years.",
      "What happened to Patsy Ramsey?",
      "Patsy Ramsey died at 49 from ovarian cancer on June 24, 2006.",
      "She had initially been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1993, and had been in remission for about nine years before the cancer returned three years before her death, according to NBC News.",
      "Patsy Ramsey died at her father\u2019s home near Atlanta, Georgia, with her husband, John Ramsey, at her side.\u00a0She was buried in a grave next to her daughter's in Marietta, Georgia.",
      "In the documentary, John Ramsey opened up about the \"devastating\" recurrence of his wife's cancer, and explains that after attempts to treat her illness, a doctor eventually recommended palliative care.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to do that. I wanted her to keep fighting, she wanted to keep fighting. And then it got to a point where I was convinced it was hopeless, and I made the decision to stop, at the doctor\u2019s recommendation, to stop treatment,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Patsy. The cancer had migrated to her brain so she was not her normal self, so she didn\u2019t know that we\u2019d given up,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd she would ask, \u2018When\u2019s my next treatment?\u2019 and I knew in my heart there was no next treatment. That was hard.\u201d",
      "In the years before her death, Patsy Ramsey remained determined to find the identity of her daughter\u2019s killer.",
      "Lou Smit, a police detective who long argued that an intruder, not the Ramseys, had murdered JonBen\u00e9t, once shared Patsy Ramsey\u2019s last words to him.",
      "\u201cThe last words she said to me were, \u2018Lou, I don\u2019t have much time left. Please catch this guy before I die,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview clip excerpted in the documentary.",
      "In a clip shared in the documentary from a 2006 appearance on New Hope Church TV, Patsy Ramsey shared her belief that she would be reunited with JonBen\u00e9t after she died, along with her stepdaughter, Beth, who died in 1992 in a car accident.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll live. But I know that when I\u2019m absent from the body, I will be at home with the Lord, and JonBen\u00e9t and Beth, and my mother who has since passed away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, all the fun people are starting to be over there, so it\u2019s going to be a glorious reunion.\u201d",
      "In the documentary, John Ramsey shared his belief that his late wife now knows what happened to JonBen\u00e9t.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked, \u2018You know, it\u2019s really too bad that Patsy passed away without knowing who killed her child.\u2019 And she knows now, I believe,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI will see Patsy again. I have no doubt,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work, or how it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s too beyond my little brain to comprehend, but I believe that that\u2019s a reality for us as humans.\u201d",
      "What did Patsy Ramsey say about her daughter?",
      "Patsy Ramsey always maintained that she and her husband had not been involved in JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s murder, and pushed for her daughter\u2019s killer to be found.",
      "She shot down allegations that she had killed JonBen\u00e9t in a fit of rage after her daughter wet the bed.",
      "\u201cDoes someone actually think I would kill my child because she wet the bed?\u201d Ramsey said in a 1999 CBS News interview. \u201cI mean, I have lived through Stage 4 cancer. In the grand scheme of things, bedwetting is not important.\u201d",
      "Ramsey also criticized the way her daughter\u2019s homicide case was handled by law enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe police that were there the morning of the 26th, taking evidence, have a lot of tangible evidence. They did a good job at collecting evidence. We have fibers. We have DNA. We have a lot of evidence,\u201d she said during an appearance on \u201cLarry King Live\" in 2000. \u201cThe problem was that then they did not take the evidence to where it would lead.\u201d",
      "She also told King that in hindsight, she and her husband \u201cshould never have moved to Boulder, Colorado.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mean, if you want to go back \u2026 But you can\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to start with what we have now. We have to move ahead. We have to try to find this killer and get him off the street.\u201d",
      "In 2000, John and Patsy Ramsey co-wrote a book about their daughter\u2019s murder and its aftermath called \u201cThe Death of Innocence: The Untold Story of JonBenet\u2019s Murder and How Its Exploitation Compromised the Pursuit of Truth.\u201d",
      "In the book, Patsy Ramsey defended her daughter\u2019s involvement in beauty pageants, saying JonBen\u00e9t begged her to participate in them. Ramsey, who had also competed in pageants, said she bonded with her daughter over the experience.",
      "\u201cI decided if this was what she liked to do, then I would see if I could make it possible. I always worried that my cancer would return someday, so I was glad to have found an activity that we could have fun with together,\u201d she wrote in the book.",
      "\u201cMother-daughter experiences were to be treasures for me, now more than ever before,\" she continued. \"If God did take me before she grew up, I reasoned, I could leave her these memories.\u201d",
      "After her daughter\u2019s death, Ramsey shared her appreciation for people who hung angels on the tree above JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s grave.",
      "\"Everyone misses her,\u201d she said on \u201cLarry King Live\u201d in 2000. \u201cShe was just a little angel herself. So I think it\u2019s befitting that all of the angels that started appearing on the tree \u2014 the dogwood tree above her gravesite.\u201d",
      "Patsy Ramsey also opened up about her belief that she would one day be reunited with her late daughter.",
      "\u201cWe have to know and believe in our faith that we will see JonBen\u00e9t again,\u201d Patsy Ramsey said on \u201cLarry King Live\u201d in 2000. \u201cShe is in Heaven with our Heavenly Father and one of these days \u2026 we will be there with her, and we live for that day. That\u2019s what keeps us going.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:41:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Matthew McConaughey shared his unconventional tuna salad recipe on the 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast, so I tried it, and it was so much better than I expected.",
    "story": [
      "Matthew McConaughey may be best known for his Oscar-winning role in \u201cDallas Buyers Club,\u201d the lasting cultural impact of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d and those pink jeans in \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d but his latest earth-shaking project is of a different sort. It\u2019s his own \u201cbadass tuna salad,\u201d with mayo, lemon, vinegar, wasabi, agave nectar, pickles, crispy jalape\u00f1os, apple, red onion, green peas and corn.",
      "Darlene Schrijver of The Salad Lab posted a video of the making of this unconventional take, and it has gone viral on Instagram and TikTok, with over 7 million combined views. (A warning before you click: Parts of the original interview from the 2 Bears, 1 Cave podcast are even more profane than putting corn in tuna salad.)",
      "McConaughey graduated from the University of Texas just before I did, and I used to hang out with the theater and communications kids a bit. Is it possible I heard him yell, \u201cAlright, alright, alright!\u201d on the quad one sunny afternoon, or handed him a Solo cup at a party? Probably not, but I would bet money we once unknowingly duked it out through the telephone enrollment exchange for that last seat in Intro to Psychology.",
      "Still, what seems more meaningful in this context are our shared Irish roots and Texas upbringing, ranging from the southwest to the northeast parts of the state. We probably grew up surrounded by many of the same culinary influences \u2014 delicate Guajillo honey, enchiladas swimming in chili gravy, chicken fried steak at Luby\u2019s Cafeteria, red popsicles dripping in the light of a heat mirage and, yes, chilled tuna salad when it was too sweltering to turn on the oven.",
      "This is not my grandmother\u2019s tuna salad, though. The wasabi alone would have driven her to hysterics.",
      "Since there\u2019s no written recipe, I\u2019ll have to make some guesses about the details. I\u2019ll bet McConaughey grew up eating chunk light in water like the rest of us, a healthy pick if perhaps a little lacking in texture, but surely he buys the good stuff now? Let\u2019s assume this is a 21st-century McConaughey tuna salad, casually mature. I\u2019m going with a great middle-of-the-road solid pack in olive oil, but if you want to allocate an extra couple of bucks to make it really special, my top dietitian\u2019s pick is Scout for flavor, dolphin-friendliness and sustainability. You can also eat lower on the food chain if you\u2019re concerned about contaminants, and switch out sardines for canned tuna in any recipe. Feeling apprehensive? I find Mediterranean sardines to be less frighteningly fishy, and Bela is one of my favorite more-reasonably-priced-but-quality brands.",
      "I wander the aisles of Texas grocery titan H-E-B, choosing the rest of my raw materials. Tasked as I am with representing our shared influences accurately, I suddenly feel the selection of each component is infused with gravest import, and I wonder at the karmic vibe of my quest. Did I ever wait in line behind McConaughey at the H-E-B on East 41st, he with a frozen pizza and two pints of butter pecan, me with Reduced Fat Triscuits and an eggplant? The truth is lost to history.",
      "The apple? Granny Smith, surely. The pickles? He says \u201cdill gherkins,\u201d but is that dill-comma-gherkins as in both, or gherkins which are dill instead of sweet? Based on context cues, I\u2019m calling it the latter. The wasabi? Alas, most of what you will get stateside is actually fake wasabi made from ground European horseradish and some kind of coloring rather than real Japanese horseradish, which is expensive and only ephemerally pungent. Mine is fake but workable enough.",
      "One special ingredient note \u2014 the crispy jalape\u00f1os he refers to, I believe, are a kind of jalape\u00f1o version of fried French\u2019s onions, and you should find them near the other salad fixings at your grocery store. They are unbelievable. If you happen to be making green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, mix a few into your topping for a cut-above side dish.",
      "I\u2019ve made a couple of minor substitutions \u2014 I\u2019m using a shallot instead of red onion, and a little extra pickle juice instead of vinegar. I suggest mixing the dressing separately so the wasabi is evenly distributed without mauling your tuna. It seems like a lot of stuff piled on a modest hunk of fish, but after tasting it, I actually went back in and added more lemon, pickle juice, jalape\u00f1o chips, dill gherkins and especially more wasabi \u2014 I started out with about a quarter teaspoon but ended up adding a full teaspoon. (Note that if you\u2019re using the real-deal leftover-from-your-lunch sushi, you may want less.)",
      "The final result is simply stellar, the best tuna salad I\u2019ve ever had, much less made myself. It\u2019s unconventional, to be sure, but it hits all the right notes. The crunch from the apple and fried jalape\u00f1os, the sweetness of the agave, the pickle punch. I wasn\u2019t at all sure about the corn, but I have to admit, it works. I had worried that the wasabi would take over, but it just pulls everything into harmony \u2026 almost. My one complaint is that occasionally the green peas pop up to undesirable prominence. If you don\u2019t love them, you could omit them or replace them with celery without altering the fundamental appeal of the recipe.",
      "As good as it was right away, after chilling for several hours, it was spectacular. I felt like the rat in Ratatouille, swooning in my kitchen. And yes, the apple was still pristine thanks to the lemon and vinegar, although the crispy jalape\u00f1os lost a bit of crunch. Consider adding those just before serving.",
      "I\u2019m tickled pink as David Wooderson\u2019s jeans with this tuna salad from my buddy, my pal, my old college chum Matthew McConaughey. I hope you head out on your own shopping trip, and if it\u2019s dinner for four, use two cans of tuna; I went back for seconds and then snuck a couple more bites later on. It\u2019s high-protein, heart-healthy if you go a little easy on the mayo, and contains both fruits and vegetables, so I\u2019m sold as a registered dietitian as well as a diner.",
      "Speaking of old buddies, now that I think of it, part of the charm of his tuna salad is that it echoes McConaughey\u2019s favorite role of mine, a lesser-known one as Deputy Buddy Deeds in \u201cLone Star\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s spicy salty, complex, terrifying at the outset and just the thing if you want to see deeply into the truth of what it means to be from here. Plus, despite early appearances, it all makes sense in the end.",
      "Except for the peas. I\u2019m just still not sure about those."

    "story": [
      "\u201cWicked\u201d broke a record when it opened with an estimated $114 million at the domestic box office this weekend, marking the highest cinematic opening for a Broadway adaptation.",
      "With the highly-anticipated musical now out in theaters, fans are no doubt already wondering when \u201cWicked\u201d will be available to stream at home.",
      "While a streaming date has not yet been announced, the film will likely land on Peacock, since it's distributed by Universal Pictures. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.) If this is the case, the Broadway adaptation could be available to stream as early as January, as Variety reported in 2021 that Universal films can premiere on Peacock as early as 45 days after their theatrical release date.",
      "However, some Universal movies take longer than 45 days to make their streaming debut.\u00a0The Universal film \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d for example, came out in theaters in July 2023 but did not premiere on Peacock until February 2024.",
      "In the meantime, \u201cWicked\u201d is enjoying strong numbers at the box office as it competes with Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d in what some have dubbed the \u201cGlicked\u201d phenomenon, similar to the \"Barbenheimer\" craze.",
      "Both movies opened on Nov. 22 with strong numbers, but \u201cWicked\u201d beat out \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which opened at an estimated $55.5 million, according to CNBC.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, two witches who strike up an unlikely friendship at Shiz University.",
      "Before \u201cWicked\u201d opened, fans were debating online whether it would be appropriate to sing along in the theater to the movie\u2019s beloved songs, including \u201cPopular\u201d and \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "Grande and Erivo weighed in on the sing-along debate in a recent interview with NBC News.",
      "\u201cI say if you come the first time and you sing through, sing through,\u201d Erivo said. \u201cBut come a second time and let us sing to you.\u201d",
      "Grande said she supports whatever makes fans \"happy,\" but also joked that \u201cif someone throws popcorn at you, or their phone or something, maybe stop.\u201d",
      "The jury may still be out on singing along during \u201cWicked\u201d screenings, but once the movie makes its streaming debut, fans can belt out the songs at home to their hearts\u2019 content.",
      "In the meantime, a Universal Pictures spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that sing-along screenings of \u201cWicked\u201d will debut in about 1,000 North American theaters starting Christmas Day."

    "summary": "TODAY goes on location for \"Holiday Touchdown,\" a new movie made in partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs and Hallmark.",
    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering on the network Nov. 30. The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from the Travis Kelce-Swift relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

Hochman has said he will examine the details of the case before he makes a decision regarding clemency or resentencing.",
      "Who is Erik Menendez's wife, Tammi Menendez?",
      "Tammi Ruth Saccoman and Erik Menendez began corresponding while he was in prison.",
      "\"We did get very close through letters and then you know the relationship moved forward when I did meet him.\u00a0But it was the correspondence that he became a really good friend of mine and understood what I was going through and I understood what he was going through,\" she told MSNBC.",
      "She wrote about their relationship in the self-published memoir \u201cThey Said We\u2019d Never Make It: My Life with Erik Menendez,\u201d which informed the 2010 A&E documentary \"Mrs. Menendez.\"",
      "Tammi Menendez told People she originally had doubts that Erik and his brother had been abused by their parents, which is what their defense team argued during their first trials in 1993, which ended in hung juries. During a second trial in 1995, which unfolded before a single jury, the brothers\u2019 evidence of abuse was not allowed. Both were sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Tammi Menendez's opinion shifted in 1996, when she learned her husband had been abusing her daughter, who was his stepdaughter, starting when she was 15, she told People. Tammi\u2019s husband turned himself in to the police, and then died by suicide two days later. Tammi was left to care for their 9-month-old.",

      "In a 2005 interview with People, Erik Menendez spoke about the effect marriage had on his life in prison.",

      "He said their marriage has transformed him. \"You can\u2019t imagine what it was like those first five years in prison never being told, 'I love you.' It makes you a colder, harder person.

      "Nearly three decades after 6-year-old JonBen\u00e9t was found dead in her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Dec. 26, 1996, the identity of her killer remains a mystery.",
      "A new three-part Netflix documentary series, \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u201d examines how the actions of law enforcement and the media at the time may have influenced the investigation.",
      "Tips and leads have emerged in the case over the years, and experts are still piecing them together in the hopes of solving her murder.",
      "\u201cI believe this crime can be solved,\u201d Joe Berlinger, the documentary\u2019s director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Berlinger says he created the documentary partly to \u201cput some pressure\u201d on police to reexamine evidence from the original crime scene using today\u2019s more advanced DNA testing technology.",
      "\u201cThere were items that were tested, but the DNA technology back then was so primitive that it\u2019s time to retest those items,\u201d he says.",
      "Berlinger also says that in his view, the evidence presented in the documentary suggests that an outside intruder, not JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s parents, committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThere is a disturbing amount of people in my mind who clinging to this theory that the Ramseys did it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just hope that my reporting is so rock solid that I will change some hearts and minds on this subject.\u201d",
      "In December 2023, the Boulder Police Department brought together the Colorado Cold Case Review Team to examine the original homicide investigation.",
      "\u201cOne focus of the new investigation is DNA testing. While forensic testing was available in 1996, the science behind DNA testing continues to rapidly evolve,\u201d Boulder police said in a 2023 release, adding they are \u201cworking with leading DNA experts from across the county to ensure the latest forensic techniques are used to analyze remaining DNA samples.\u201d",
      "The review team also digitized and consolidated all the evidence collected over the years in the case, including more than 21,000 tips, more than 1,000 interviews, and samples of DNA, fingerprints, shoeprints and handwriting from more than 200 people, per the 2023 release.",
      "\u201cThe overarching goal is to look at the facts and evidence with fresh eyes and an open mind, armed with the latest developments in forensic science,\u201d Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in the release.",
      "While the identity of her killer, or killers, remains to be discovered, certain facts about the circumstances of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s death are known, including her cause of death and the details of the injuries she suffered the night of Dec. 26, 1996.",
      "Read on to learn more about what happened to JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, according to her autopsy.",
      "What does JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s autopsy say?",
      "JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s cause of death was \u201casphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma,\u201d according to an autopsy released by the Office of the Boulder County Coroner on Dec. 27, 1996.",
      "According to the autopsy, she suffered from ligature strangulation and had a deep ligature furrow, or an indentation from something being tied, reaching all the way around her neck. There was also a ligature around her right wrist.",
      "A length of white cord was found \u201cwrapped around the neck with a double knot in the midline of the posterior neck,\u201d and the cord had been \u201ccut on the right side of the neck and removed,\u201d the autopsy says.",
      "JonBen\u00e9t also had a scalp contusion, or bruise, as well as a fracture on the right side of her skull.",
      "Other head injuries included subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, which are both types of bleeding in the brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "In addition, the autopsy notes abrasions on her right cheek, right shoulder, left lower back, and left lower leg.",
      "The autopsy also notes an \u201carea of abrasion\u201d involving the \u201chymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall,\u201d as well as a \u201csmall amount of dried blood\u201d on parts of the perineum and labia majora.",
      "The report notes additionally that a toxicologic screening detected no drugs or ethanol in her blood.",
      "What else did her autopsy find?",
      "JonBen\u00e9t was first examined at the Ramsey\u2019s home by pathologist John E. Meyer on the night she was murdered on Dec. 26.",
      "\u201cI initially viewed the body in the living room of the house,\u201d Meyer wrote in the autopsy. \u201cThe decedent was laying on her back on the floor, covered by a blanket and a Colorado Avalanche sweatshirt. On removing these two items from the top of the body the decedent was found to be lying on her back with her arms extended up over her head.\u201d",
      "He noted that Ramsey was just under four feet tall and weighed an estimated 45 pounds.",
      "The autopsy also noted that she was found wearing a yellow bracelet with the name \u201cJonBen\u00e9t\u201d on one side and the date \u201c12/25/96\u201d on the other side. She also had a \u201cred ink line drawing in the form of a heart\u201d located on her left palm.",
      "According to the autopsy, JonBen\u00e9t was found wearing a long-sleeved, white collarless shirt decorated with sequins, as well as white long underwear.",
      "Her underwear was \u201curine stained,\u201d and \u201cin the inner aspect of the crotch,\u201d there were \u201cseveral red areas of staining,\u201d according to the autopsy.",
      "Several items were turned over to the Boulder Police Department as evidence according to the autopsy, including fibers and hair, ligatures found on the scene, and clothing, as well as vaginal, rectal and oral swabs and smears.",
      "Pieces of evidence also turned over to the police included fingernail clippings, jewelry, samples of hair, eyelashes and eyebrows, and blood samples, among other items.",
      "After Meyer\u2019s initial examination of Ramsey at her family home, he conducted a full autopsy the following day, doing an internal exam of her body, including her lungs, heart, liver, musculoskeletal system, skull and brain.",
      "JonBen\u00e9t was buried on Dec. 31, 1996, in Marietta, Georgia."

The release of both movies on Nov. 22 led to the \"Glicked\" double feature phenomenon and was predicted to be a sequel to \"Barbenheimer\" \u2014 when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d hit theaters on the same day in July 2023.",
      "The arrival of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d did not disappoint. The two cinematic events dominated the box office with impressive numbers.",

      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande\u2019s Broadway spectacle adapted for the big screen won the weekend as \u201cWicked\u201d opened with around $114 million at the domestic box office, CNBC reported. That number makes the movie the biggest debut ever for a Broadway adaptation. It also marks the third-highest opening weekend this year, behind \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d (Universal Pictures and TODAY.com share a parent company, Comcast.)",

      "Theaters were hoping to recapture the magic \u2014 and numbers \u2014 that \"Barbenheimer\" brought to the box office in July 2023. But, they didn\u2019t quite reach the $182 million and $80.5 million \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d respectively, brought in.",
      "Not only did the two blockbusters attract audiences to the theaters last year, they were also at the center of awards season. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ended up winning many of the top awards at the 2024 Oscars, including best picture, best director for Christopher Nolan, best actor for Cillian Murphy and best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr.",

      "A cease-fire deal to end the conflict between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia was close but not complete Monday, three senior Biden administration officials told NBC News.",
      "One official said \"there are still a few issues left to be resolved,\" with another cautioning a deal \"could still take a couple of days.\"",
      "White House national security adviser John\u00a0Kirby called the discussions \"productive.\"",
      "\"But nothing is done until it\u2019s all done, and it\u2019s not done right now,\" he said at a briefing Monday.",
      "The potential development comes amid a continuation of heavy strikes from both sides. Over the weekend, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 20 people in the Lebanese capital of Beirut while Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets at Israel, leaving neighborhoods in flames, according to the Israeli military. More Israeli airstrikes followed on the suburbs of Beirut.",
      "The latest clashes follow months of intensifying fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, with Hezbollah firing rockets and other projectiles into Israel after the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are both allied with Iran.",
      "Danny Danon, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that cease-fire talks were advancing.",
      "\"We haven\u2019t finalized it, but we are moving forward,\" he said.",
      "The cease-fire would be limited to Lebanon, meaning it would not bring relief to Palestinians in Gaza or the dozens of hostages taken by Hamas.",
      "In a statement, the families of the hostages said they \"strongly urge\" any agreement to include a demand for the release of those who are being held.",
      "\"The October 7 attack, orchestrated by Hamas and supported by Iran, saw Hezbollah join the conflict, linking its fate to the war in Gaza and the atrocities of the October 7 massacre,\" the statement read in part.",
      "\"The current efforts to secure an agreement ending the war on the northern front present a vital opportunity to bring all hostages home. The northern front and the hostages\u2019 release are inseparably linked \u2014 we cannot and must not treat them as separate issues.\"",
      "Israel\u2019s ground and air assault has killed well over 3,000 people in Lebanon and has displaced more than 1 million others, according to local officials. The attacks have spanned as far as parts of Syria, where a recent Israeli airstrike killed a senior Hezbollah commander.",
      "Talks of a possible cease-fire come about a month after Israel attacked Iran on its soil, stoking fears that Iran would retaliate and dramatically escalate tensions in the region. However, the Iranian army downplayed the attack after, saying \"damage was limited.\""

    "story": [
      "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Israeli airstrikes Saturday in central Beirut killed at least 20 people, officials said, as the once-rare attacks on the heart of Lebanon\u2019s capital continued without warning while diplomats scrambled to broker a cease-fire.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said 66 people were wounded in the strikes, which were the fourth in central Beirut in less than a week.",
      "The escalation comes after U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein\u00a0traveled to the region\u00a0in pursuit of a deal to end\u00a0months of fighting\u00a0between Israel and Hezbollah that has erupted into full-on war.",
      "Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry. The fighting has displaced about 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by bombardment in northern Israel and the fighting.",
      "An eight-story building is turned to rubble",
      "The 4 a.m. strikes destroyed an eight-story building in central Beirut. Hezbollah legislator Amin Shiri said no Hezbollah officials were inside. The attack stripped the facades from some nearby buildings and crumpled cars.",
      "\u201cThe area is residential, with closely packed buildings and narrow streets, making the situation challenging,\u201d said Walid Al-Hashash, a first responder with the Lebanese Civil Defense.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not comment on the casualties.",
      "Also Saturday, a drone strike killed two people and injured three in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.",

      "The Health Ministry said other airstrikes killed eight people, including four children, in the eastern town of Shmustar, five others in the southern village of Roumin, and another five people in the northeastern village of Budai..",
      "Sticking points in cease-fire talks",
      "Two Western diplomatic officials on Saturday described disputed points between Israel and Lebanon in cease-fire negotiations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks.",
      "The current proposal calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. Thousands more Lebanese army troops would patrol the border area with U.N. peacekeepers, and an international committee would monitor the deal\u2019s implementation.",
      "The officials said Israel wanted more guarantees that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials have said they would not agree to a deal that did not explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it.",
      "Lebanese officials have said the inclusion of such a term would violate their country\u2019s sovereignty. And Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said this week that the militant group would not agree to a deal that doen\u2019ts not entail a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive end to the aggression.\u201d",
      "Lebanon and Israel also dispute which countries would sit on the monitoring committee. The officials said Israel refused to allow France, which has been close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended. Lebanon refused to have Britain, a close ally of Israel.",
      "Deadly strikes in Gaza and people trapped in rubble",
      "In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said at least 80 people, total, were killed on Thursday and Friday, including near the Kamal Adwan and Al-Ahli hospitals. It said dozens of people were trapped under the rubble.",
      "Israel\u2019s army said it wasn\u2019t aware of a strike near Kamal Adwan, and it didn\u2019t respond to questions about the other attacks.",
      "On Saturday, at least six people, including three children and two women, were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Associated Press reporters and staff at Nasser Hospital.",
      "\u201cSuddenly we woke up to dust, smoke and a fire,\u201d said one grieving father, Ahmad Ghassan. \u201cWe found him dead and his brother injured.\u201d Another father wept as he carried his child\u2019s body in a bloodstained sheet.",
      "And Al-Awda Hospital said it received six bodies after Israel shelled a house north of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.",
      "The Palestinian death toll from the 13-month-long war surpassed 44,000 this week, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. It has said more than half the dead are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians,\u00a0and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",
      "The Israeli offensive in Gaza\u00a0has devastated\u00a0wide areas, and around 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with little food, water or basic services.",
      "At least two women were shot dead Saturday while waiting in line for bread in central Deir al-Balah, relatives and witnesses told the AP. It was unclear who shot them and why.",
      "The United Nations says its attempts to support hard-hit northern Gaza, which has been the focus of a renewed Israeli offensive for weeks, have been denied or impeded, and that less than 20% of the population has remained there since the offensive began."

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 Most have on jeans, some wear rough work boots, and one sings with a white construction helmet tucked under his arm. Gathered in the church hall before the altar, their song begins low and soft, surges and then sweeps through the Gothic-style church and up to its soaring stone ceiling.",
      "The 80-strong choir has come together to do more than sing, though \u2014 the crew of architects, stonemasons, archaeologists, art historians, art conservators and others have helped rebuild Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral after a fire ripped through the iconic French Gothic masterpiece nearly five years ago.",
      "With hundreds of people working to rebuild a structure so intimately tied to French art, history and culture, it felt natural to start a choir, said Stephanie Duch\u00eane, a conservation scientist and chemical engineer who helped form the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir, or Notre Dame Companions, nearly two years ago.",
      "Much like the building and rebuilding of a cathedral, a small army of individuals needs to work in unison to create extraordinary music.",
      "\u201cEveryone has to do his part to make the music sound good,\u201d said Duch\u00eane, the chief archaeologist and conservation scientist for the Laboratory of Research for Historical Monuments.",
      "Five years after the blaze that destroyed much of the cathedral\u2019s roof and brought down its iconic spire, long one of the city skyline\u2019s most recognizable sights, the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir is preparing to perform in the building they helped save. It will be part of a weekslong celebration marking the long-awaited reopening.",
      "On Dec. 11, the choir will perform a rendition of French composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCantique de Jean Racine,\u201d or \u201cChant by Jean Racine.\u201d",
      "Like many others, Duch\u00eane remembers exactly where she was when she heard about the blaze.",

Just weeks before, she and her husband had taken their children to visit the cathedral \u2014 and now it was at risk of being reduced to rubble and ashes, she remembers.",
      "\u201cEveryone was very sad and very anxious about the potential collapse of the cathedral overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very relieved in the morning when we saw that it was \u2014 that she was \u2014 still standing.\u201d",
      "Agnes Poirier, a French author who published the book \u200b\u200b\u201dNotre-Dame: The Soul of France,\u201d in the aftermath of the fire, echoes the pervasive feeling that the cathedral is much more than simply a building."

The conference was set to end\u00a0Friday but negotiations over funding extended into the weekend.",
      "A draft of a deal to help the world adapt to and deal with climate change released at the conference, known as COP29, pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. While rich nations say it\u2019s realistic and about the limit of what they can do, it is less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather.",
      "The conference was already shadowed by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement climate change treaty the first time he was president and has vowed to do so again. The atmosphere had also been dampened by poor attendance by world leaders, particularly from wealthy nations.",
      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",
      "Who foots the bill?",

    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions got underway Monday morning, with reigning champion Ding Liren taking game 1 of the World Chess Championship against 18-year-old phenom Gukesh Dommaraju.",
      "While the world championship is still considered chess' marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the $2.5 million showdown between Liren, a soft-spoken assassin from China, and Gukesh, an up-and-coming prodigy from India, should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

      "The death of a 2-year-old western lowland gorilla at a Canadian zoo earlier this month was found to be the result of human error, the zoo announced.",
      "The female gorilla, Eyare, had been roaming between different rooms in the zoo's gorilla enclosure on Nov. 12 when a member of her care team activated a hydraulic door, Colleen Baird, director of animal care, health and welfare at the Calgary Zoo, said in a Wednesday statement.",
      "The care team member \u2014 intending to separate Eyare from other gorillas for an individual training session \u2014  accidentally activated the wrong door, striking the young gorilla, who sustained traumatic head injuries. Despite the zoo's veterinary team immediately commencing lifesaving measures, Eyare died from her injuries, Baird said.",
      "The zoo said that they immediately launched a formal investigation into Eyare's death and removed the gorilla care team member responsible from the workplace following the incident. That member will be \"reassigned to another area of the zoo and will undergo further staff training for that area.\"",
      "\"This tragedy has struck us all in the deepest way imaginable,\" said Baird. \"Eyare\u2019s short but impactful life brought so much joy to our community, and she will be deeply missed by all. We will do everything we can to prevent future incidents.\"",
      "Some of the preventative actions the zoo will be taking include: Mandating that the gorilla care team participate in specialized recurrent training in operating hydraulic doors; training the gorillas to maintain a safe distance from doors during movement times; and implementing changes to improve staff ability to confirm what animal door they are moving, according to the release.",
      "The zoo said they are also exploring the idea of transitioning to alternative door and control designs, instead of continuing to use hydraulic doors.",
      "Of the 4,000 animals the zoo cares for, six are western lowland gorillas. The Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo has only had one other human-caused animal mortality over the last ten years: a North American river otter in 2016, the release said."

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:50:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Former member of Parliament Vladimir Luxuria, said she relates to the controversy facing Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender person elected to the Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah McBride is\u00a0the first openly transgender person elected to the U.S. Congress, but she is not the first trans politician to be banned from using the bathroom of her choice by a hostile fellow lawmaker.",
      "Back in 2006 in Italy, newly elected Vladimir Luxuria was briefly barred from using the ladies' room when she took her seat in Parliament. She said her heart breaks for McBride, a Democrat from Delaware.",
      "\"They did that to me,\" Luxuria, 59, said in a telephone interview with NBC News from her home in Rome. \"What is happening to Sarah McBride is rank politics.\"",
      "Which bathroom McBride will be able to use in the next Congress  became an issue last week when Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican and staunch supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, introduced a resolution to prohibit lawmakers and House employees from \u201cusing single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.\u201d",
      "When asked if the move was specifically in response to McBride, Mace said, \"yes and absolutely, and then some.\" Not long afterward, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is also a Republican and a Trump supporter, said he supports restricting \u201csingle-sex facilities\u201d in the Capitol, including restrooms, to \u201cindividuals of that biological sex.\"",
      "McBride, in a\u00a0post on X, responded, \u201cEvery day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness.\u201d",
      "Luxuria, who left Parliament in 2008 and is an actress and activist, was following in the footsteps of the late Georgina Beyer, a New Zealander who became the world\u2019s first openly transgender member of Parliament when she was elected in 1999.",
      "The only other transgender woman who has served in a national parliament is Poland's Anna Grodzka, who was elected in 2011 and served one four-year term.",
      "Luxuria said she had endured a lifetime of \"cruelty\" but was still shocked when Italian lawmaker Elisabetta Gardini, who was a supporter of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, confronted her \"outside the women's toilet.\"",
      "\"I always went to the women's bathroom because if I even tried to use the men's toilet they would be embarrassed and demand to know what I am doing there,\" Luxuria said. \"So when I came out, I was surprised when Gardini began yelling at me, 'What were you doing in here! You're a man!'\"",
      "Luxuria said Gardini \"was very angry\" but she was determined not to back down.",
      "She said she told Gardini: \"OK, I am a trans woman. But if you don't want to see me in here, you should go use the men's toilet.\"",
      "Luxuria said Gardini walked off in a huff and in no time \"the matter of where I could go to the bathroom became a debate in Parliament.\"",
      "\"I was lucky because, in the end, the members of Parliament decided I could use the women's bathroom,\" she said. \"But it was embarrassing that it became an issue.\"",
      "Luxuria said she has her suspicions about why Gardini, who was a well-known actress and popular TV personality before she got into politics, went after her.",
      "\"I suspect Berlusconi's party wanted to make this an issue to attack my party, which was in opposition,\" she said. \"So I am very sympathetic to Sarah McBride.\"",
      "Gardini did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Noting that Mace once described herself as a pro-LGBTQ social moderate, Luxuria said she thinks Mace's attack on McBride was part of a bigger plan to try to divide Democrats and force them to defend an issue that still makes many Americans \"uncomfortable.\"",
      "\"The purpose here is to generate hate for political purposes,\" Luxuria said.",
      "McBride and Mace did not reply to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In the aftermath of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019  loss to Trump, some Democrats and pundits have pointed to the Biden administration\u2019s support for transgender rights as one reason Republicans prevailed.",
      "They noted that the Republicans spent more than $200 million on network television advertisements\u00a0that underscored Harris\u2019 past support for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care treatments\u00a0and that repeatedly aired\u00a0during NFL and college football games.",
      "During her four years in the Polish Parliament, Grodzka also faced verbal attacks and was repeatedly misgendered by fellow Polish lawmaker Krystyna Pawlowicz. In an interview with Pink News, an LGBTQ digital news outlet based in Britain, in 2013, Grodzka largely brushed off the transphobic comments.",
      "\u201cKrystyna is a very conservative person, therefore I guess I am probably just a little bit too much for her,\" Grodza said. \u201cShe has an imaginary idea of a [perfect] person who is supposed to go to church, etc. \u2026 In that case I ruin her picture, therefore it\u2019s a reason for her to attack me.\"",
      "In recent years \u2014 nearly a decade after she left Parliament \u2014 Grodzka is still occasionally on the receiving end of personal attacks from Polish lawmakers, as the country's right-wing has embraced anti-LGBTQ sentiments.",
      "In a 2002 documentary about Beyer called \"Georgie Girl,\" Beyer said she commonly faced questions about her gender identity that other politicians would not have to endure.",
      "\u201cI get asked questions no other politician would ever have to answer,\" she said. \"Regarding the surgery, you know. \u2018Did it hurt?\u2019 or, \u2018When you have sex now as a woman, is it different to how you had sex as a man?\u2019 Well, honey, obviously.\u201d"

      "Now, candidates for Supreme Court seats and federal judgeships need only a law degree, a grade point average of 3.2, \u201cfive years of professional experience\u201d and five letters of recommendation from neighbors or friends. That, and some luck in the final drawing.",
      "Officials rejected criticism that has called the process rushed or amateurish for the often highly technical posts that can hear cases including intellectual property, organized crime and Constitutional law.",
      "\u201cThe results have been spectacular,\u201d said Arturo Zaldivar, a top adviser to President Claudia Sheinbaum.",

      "The 53 audios, obtained by the Federal Police and accessed by The Associated Press on Monday, provide a rare chance to hear military members expressing in their own voices their desire to keep\u00a0leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u00a0from taking office.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the police\u2019s sprawling investigation, quoted some of those audios in his ruling last week ordering the arrest of five people for plotting the assassination of then-President-elect Lula in 2022 and then attempting to\u00a0oust him from power on Jan. 8, 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters destroyed government buildings in the capital Brasilia.",

Mario Fernandes, who was then second in command at the general secretary of the presidency, that the far-right leader had a clear choice after Lula won his third, non-consecutive term.",
      "\u201cIt will be either a civil war now or civil war later. We have a justification now for civil war; people are on the streets, we have massive support,\u201d Criscuoli said in one of the audios. \u201cLet\u2019s do this now. Speak to 01.\u201d",

He left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there for months, keeping a low profile. The top electoral court has ruled Bolsonaro ineligible to run for president until 2030 for abuse of power, and he is also the target of several\u00a0investigations for a slew of potential crimes.",
      "Other audios are less explicit in their wording about the urgent need for a coup. In a voice message to Gen. Fernandes, Col. Reginaldo Vieira de Abreu used an expression frequently repeated by Bolsonaro to argue the country\u2019s constitution should be ignored.",
      "\u201cWe are at war, they are winning. It is almost over and they haven\u2019t fired a single shot. It is because of our incompetence,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cOn the 12th... It would have to be before the 12th, right?\u201d Cid said, referencing the day that the electoral court would certify Lula\u2019s victory. \u201cI will speak to the president. The thing is his personality sometimes. He waits, waits, waits, waits to see where it is going. To see who supports him. But sometimes time is short, right? We can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d",
      "De Moraes\u2019 arrest order last week makes reference to Cid\u2019s comment, but it did not include his full statement.",
      "Cid was already under house arrest, after having signed a plea bargain deal with authorities last year. His testimony has helped authorities collect evidence in different cases targeting Bolsonaro and some of his key aides, including Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff and running mate for reelection.",
      "In the audios, Gen. Fernandes, who was among those de Moraes ordered arrested last week, repeatedly claimed Brazil\u2019s presidential election had been rigged for Lula and insisted the military high command should be pressured to aid Bolsonaro\u2019s cause before his leftist rival assumed power.",

      "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Google\u00a0and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms urged the Australian government on Tuesday to delay a\u00a0bill\u00a0that will ban most forms of social media for children under 16, saying more time is needed to assess its potential impact.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left government wants to pass the bill, which represents some of the toughest controls on children\u2019s social media use imposed by any country, into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.",
      "The bill was introduced in Parliament last week and opened for submissions of opinions for only one day.",
      "Google and Meta said in their submissions that the government should wait for the results of an age-verification trial before going ahead.",
      "The age-verification system may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the bill, nor the impact of such measures on Australians,\u201d Meta said.",
      "\u201cIn its present form, the bill is inconsistent and ineffective.\u201d",
      "The law would force social media platforms, and not parents or children, to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for systemic breaches.",
      "The opposition Liberal party is expected to support the bill, though some independent lawmakers have accused the government of rushing through the entire process in around a week.",
      "A Senate committee responsible for communications legislation was scheduled to deliver a report on Tuesday.",
      "ByteDance\u2019s TikTok said the bill lacked clarity and that it had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d with the government\u2019s plan to pass the bill without detailed consultation with experts, social media platforms, mental health organizations and young people.",
      "\u201cWhere novel policy is put forward, it\u2019s important that legislation is drafted in a thorough and considered way, to ensure it is able to achieve its stated intention. This has not been the case with respect to this Bill,\u201d TikTok said.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X raised concerns that the bill will negatively affect the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.",
      "The U.S. billionaire, who views himself as a champion of free speech, attacked\u00a0the Australian government last week, saying the bill seemed like a backdoor way to control access to the internet."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean man hoping to avoid mandatory military service has been convicted after trying to eat his way out of it.",
      "The man, who has not been publicly identified, was found guilty of dodging national service after he deliberately tried to gain so much weight it would make him ineligible for combat duty, an official at the Seoul Eastern District Court told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "He was sentenced to one year in prison, suspended for two years, under the Military Service Act, which allows for sentences of up to three years for evading mandatory military service without justifiable cause.",
      "South Korea requires almost all able-bodied male citizens between the ages of 18 and 35 to complete a minimum of 18 months of military service, in a controversial policy that dates to the 1950s after the Korean War.",
      "The court said the man had doubled his daily food intake and consumed excessive water ahead of his physical examination for the national military draft.\u00a0At his initial exam in 2017, he was assessed at Level 2, the second-highest level, qualifying him to serve in a combat\u00a0position. But when he went for another physical examination last year he was assessed at Level 4, the weight gain having resulted in a body mass index that classified him as obese.",
      "The assessment meant he would be spared from combat duty and instead assigned a non-combat role at a government agency that allowed him to commute from home.",
      "The court official said the man got the binge-eating idea from a friend, who was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for one year. The friend denied the accusation in court, claiming he did not think the man would follow through on the suggestion.",
      "The sentences were \u201crelatively lenient\u201d\u00a0because neither of the men had previous criminal convictions, the court official said.",
      "\u201cMost of all,\u201d the official said, the man \u201caccepted his wrongdoing and vowed to serve his military duty sincerely.\u201d",
      "The official could not confirm whether the man had started his military service.",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Seyed Ismail Nafeesa from Hong Kong."
