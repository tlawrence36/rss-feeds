      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",
      "\u201cShe had a number of issues that went unaddressed and found coping mechanisms to get through life,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cI think a lot of people are undiagnosed with things and just make do. Maybe she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fear,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was the fear that I focused on the most. She attacks before anyone can attack her, and she thinks everyone is attacking her.\u201d",
      "But Pansy\u2019s specific diagnosis isn\u2019t the point of \u201cHard Truths.\u201d It's much more about how her family and the outside world react to her. She might be pushing everyone away, but it's clear she's in urgent need of something.",
      "\u201cI want so desperately for someone to help Pansy,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think it would be very convenient to go, \u2018She\u2019s got this mental illness or that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her.\u2019 But what\u2019s more interesting is that we don\u2019t actually know and she\u2019s just in pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d ultimately ends in a kind of cliffhanger, with Pansy and her family locked in stasis. If Pansy tests the boundaries of empathy an audience might feel for a character, it's a moment of truth: Does Pansy go to her husband or refuse to budge? Jean-Baptiste wants to believe in her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she goes, I do, because I like her,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI like Pansy. I gotta look out for her.\u201d"

      "John Mulaney\u2019s second trip to Broadway took little convincing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",
      "Director Alex Timbers first approached Rich, the son of noted critic Frank Rich, with the idea of transferring some of his short stories to the stage.",
      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",
      "The audience at the Hudson Theatre during one recent performance was notably younger than for most Broadway shows and Mulaney and Rich hope they can do some theatrical recruitment with \u201cAll In.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we are finding that there are some first-time theatergoers or new theater goers that are coming and we\u2019re thrilled by that,\u201d says Rich. \u201cWe hope that comedy fans will enjoy this experience and that it\u2019ll help convert them into theater fans and maybe they\u2019ll see this show and want to check out more.\u201d"

      "Stepping onto the set of \u201cSquid Game\u201d season two, Lee Jong-jae felt like he had never left.",
      "\u201cIncluding promotion, I'd been living with Gi-hun for about two years,\" said Lee in a recent interview. \u201cI really felt like I was him,\" he said in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a Korean phrase, \u2018there\u2019s not a sequel that does better than its prequel,\u2019 said actor Yang Dong-geong, whose character debuts in season two. \"I've been careful because we aren't really sure what the reaction will be.\u201d The outlook is positive. Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",
      "The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer. Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his villain role from season one, has appeared in big budget English-language films like \u201cG.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra\u201d with Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid and \u201cRed 2\u201d with Bruce Willis. It's \u201cSquid Game\u201d that he credits for taking his career to another level.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that I\u2019ve been in. If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

      "An animated game, anyway.",
      "The real game takes place at Madison Square Garden, where Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs face the New York Knicks in a game televised on ABC and ESPN and streamed on Disney+ and ESPN+. The special alt-cast, the first animated presentation of an NBA game, will be shown on ESPN2 and also stream on Disney+ and ESPN+.",
      "Madison Square Garden is a staple of the NBA's Christmas schedule. Now it merges with a bigger home of the holidays, because the \u201cDunk the Halls\u201d game will be staged at Disney, on a court set up right smack in the middle of where countless families have posed for vacation photos.",
      "Why that location?",
      "Because it was Mickey Mouse\u2019s Christmas wish.",
      "\u201cBasketball courts often have the ability to make a normal environment look special, but in Disney it can only turn out incredible,\u201d Wembanyama said in an ESPN video promoting his Christmas debut.",
      "The story \u2014 this is Disney, after all \u2014 begins with Mickey penning a letter to Santa Claus, asking if he and his pals can host a basketball game. They'll not only get to watch one with NBA players, but some of them will even get to play. Goofy and Donald Duck will sub in for a couple Knicks players, while Mickey and Minnie Mouse will come on to play for the Spurs.",
      "\u201cIt looks to me like Goofy and Jalen Brunson have a really good pick-and-roll at the elite level,\u201d said Phil Orlins, an ESPN vice president of production.",
      "Walt Disney World hosted real NBA games in 2020, when the league set up there to complete its season that had been suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those games were played at the ESPN Wide World of Sports.",
      "The setting for the Christmas game will be Main Street USA, at the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. Viewers will recognize Cinderella\u2019s castle behind one baseline and the train station at the other end, and perhaps some shops they have visited in between.",
      "Previous alternate animated broadcasts included an NFL game taking place in Andy's room from \u201cToy Story;\u201d the \u201cNHL Big City Greens Classic\u201d during a game between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers; and earlier this month, another NFL matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys also taking place at Springfield\u2019s Atoms Stadium as part of \u201c The Simpsons Funday Football. \u201d",
      "Unlike basketball, the players are helmeted in those sports. So, this telecast required an extra level of detail and cooperation with players and teams to create accurate appearances of their faces and hairstyles.",
      "\"So, this is a level of detail that we\u2019ve never gone, that we\u2019ve never done on any other broadcast,\" said David Sparrgrove, the senior director of creative animation for ESPN.",
      "Wembanyama, the 7-foot-3 phenom from France who was last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, looks huge even among most NBA players. The creators of the alternate telecast had to design how he'd look not only among his teammates and rivals, but among mice, ducks and chipmunks.",
      "\u201cLike, Victor Wembanyama, seeing him in person is insane. It\u2019s like seeing an alien descend on a basketball court, and I think we kind of captured that in his animated character,\u201d said Drew Carter, who will again handle play-by-play duties, as he had in the previous animated telecasts, and will get an assist from sideline reporter Daisy Duck.",
      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast. The noon EST start means it will begin in the early evening in France and should draw well there. Also, it comes after ABC televises the \u201cDisney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade\u201d for the previous two hours, providing more time to hype the broadcast.",
      "Recognizing that some viewers who then switch over to the animated game may be Disney experts but NBA novices, there will be 10 educational explainers to help with basketball lingo and rules.",
      "Beyond Sports' visualization technology and Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye tracking allow the animated players to make the same movements and plays made moments earlier by the real ones at MSG. Carter and analyst Monica McNutt will be animated in the style of the telecast, donning VR headsets to experience the game from Main Street, USA.",
      "Other animated faces recognizable to some viewers include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who will judge a halftime dunk contest among Mickey and his friends, and Santa himself, who will operate ESPN\u2019s \u201cSkyCam\u201d during the game.",
      "The players are curious how the production \u2014 and themselves \u2014 will look.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so crazy to see the game animated,\u201d Spurs veteran Chris Paul said. \u201cI think what\u2019s dope about it is it will give kids another opportunity to watch a game and to see us, basically, as characters.\u201d",

      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years.

The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",

It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",
      "Many of Disney\u2019s live-action adaptations \u2013 including \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cJungle Book\u201d \u2013 have been big hits. Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.",
      "Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",
      "Family films like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cSonic 3\u201d have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26% of this year's box office.",
      "\u201cThe box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",

      "The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (\u201cWithout Me\u201d), Selena Gomez (\u201cBack to You\u201d) and Tate McRae (\u201cGreedy\u201d). Her contributions to Harry Styles' \u201cHarry's House\u201d earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Ros\u00e9, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake.",
      "2024, however, was the year Allen's work became inescapable \u2014 thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s bubbly \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d including \u201cEspresso,\u201d an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone's favorite lyric? \u201cHeartbreak is one thing, my ego\u2019s another / I beg you, don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)",
      "This fall, Allen's work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks \u2014 an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "\u201cOnce the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,\u201d Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them.",
      "When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d is up for album of the year and \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d for song of the year.",
      "Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for \u201cBetter Place,\u201d a collaboration with NSYNC for \u201cTrolls: Band Together.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,\u201d said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d of Allen.",
      "\u201cShe just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, \u2018anything is possible today,\u2019\u201d added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter's album. \u201cThe ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.\u201d",
      "Allen's path to professional songwriting wasn't necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option.",
      "\u201cI had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she\u2019s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspresso\u201d came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones \u201cwere kids having fun and laughing and playing,\u201d Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track's cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (\u201cthat's that me espresso\u201d).",
      "Allen believes \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d found success through its quirky, playful pop \u2014 because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective.",
      "\u201cThe general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it\u2019s almost impossible for the public to turn away.\u201d",
      "In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff\u2019s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from \u201cAmy Allen,\u201d her self-titled debut album released in September \u2014 a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop.",
      "Touring those songs came with a realization. \u201cI love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,\u201d said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song \u201cIssues.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to go after both,\u201d Allen said.",

      "\u201cTo be in a place where it\u2019s all clicking and it all feels right, that\u2019s the real special feeling,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cI think it reinforces our commitment and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappiness Bastards\u201d is a 10-track romping tour of rock, from the Southern boogie of \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d to the stuttering stomp of \u201cCross Your Fingers\u201d and the airy cool of \u201cWilted Rose.\u201d There's blues harmonica, some glam rock, '70s harmonies and fun AC/DC-like riffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funky and it\u2019s rockin' and it\u2019s kind of a little bit salty here and there. But ultimately, I think it\u2019s very interesting,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s just integrated with everything that we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "The band last released a studio album in 2009, and the volatile Robinson brothers needed a decade apart before they regrouped in 2019. In 2022, they released an EP with covers of David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, T. Rex, Little Feat and Rod Stewart. Now they're in the same Grammy category as the Stones.",
      "Critics have welcomed the brothers back, with Paste magazine calling the new album \u201ca respectable collection of bluesy rockers that showcase the brothers\u2019 strengths\u201d and Rolling Stone describing it as \u201cfun, energetic and, unmistakably not-crusty.\u201d",
      "Some cynics thought the reunion was simply a cash grab, an attempt to monetize fans of the band yearning for the '90s and a good-time rock concert. The strong album and Grammy love refutes that argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we did it and we\u2019ve been successful. And all these years later we wrote these new songs and, boom, here we are,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cThe validation of that is really unique to us.\u201d",
      "The way the brothers come up with a song hadn't changed over the years. During the pandemic, Rich started sending a flood of ideas to his brother to see what clicked with him.",
      "Chris wrote the lyrics for \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d in 20 minutes after Rich \u2014 inspired by AC/DC \u2014 sent him a killer riff. \u201cRich just handed me a hanging curveball. \u2018I can hit this,\u2019 you know what I mean?\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have to emphasize how much fun we\u2019re having in this band.\u201d",
      "One difference this time was the addition of an outside producer. The Robinson brothers had produced all The Black Crowes albums after their second and wanted a new element.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s bring in someone that\u2019s going to challenge us a little bit and maybe would have a point of view that we don\u2019t have.\u2019 Someone that can look at everything from 10,000 feet,\u201d says Rich Robinson.",
      "That happened with producer Jay Joyce, who has worked with artists like Cage the Elephant, Lainey Wilson and Eric Church. Joyce pushed them and was able to negotiate the sibling rivalry, what some call the U.S. equivalent to Oasis.",

      "His brother agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs, we've had our trials and tribulations, and we kind of came out stronger in the end. Chris and I\u2019s relationship is in the best place it\u2019s been probably in our lives.\u201d",
      "The brothers hint about that on the album's last song \u2014 \u201cKindred Friends\u201d \u2014 which strikes a loving, wistful note. \u201cKindred friend, where have you been?/Guess it's been a while/Through thick and thin/Many times again/Always makes me smile.\u201d",
      "The Robinsons say the song is partly about them but could be a toast to an old lover and is also reaching out to their fans after all these years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sweetness to it,\u201d says Rich Robinson. \u201cI sent it to Chris and what he sang on it was really moving. It\u2019s a great way to end that record, you know?\u201d",

      "\u2018Tis the season for spirited and winless debates about what the best Christmas movie is. No one needs us to remind you about the obvious holiday movies playing on repeat on cable, whether it's \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \u201cHome Alone\" or \u201cLove, Actually,\" or even those holiday adjacent classics like \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But perhaps you are looking to go beyond the obvious this year (sorry, \u201cChristmas Story,\" \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d etc, etc).",
      "Associated Press Film Writers Jake Coyle and Lindsey Bahr have you covered with the best Christmas films for every mood.",
      "\u201cGrand Budapest Hotel\u201d: Truthfully, there\u2019s nothing outside of a little snow to make Wes Anderson\u2019s 2014 delight a Christmas movie. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another movie that better resembles the experience of opening a present than \u201cGrand Budapest Hotel.\u201d Unwrap Anderson\u2019s intricate designs and the movie\u2019s Russian doll-like narratives, and smile. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMetropolitan\u201d (1990): Who among us hasn\u2019t dreamt of doing debutante season in New York? Maybe don\u2019t answer that, but Whit Stillman\u2019s \u201cMetropolitan,\u201d about a few privileged youths on the Upper East Side, is the ideal film to turn on when you\u2019re craving something that feels like an elegant evening on the town but doesn't require breaking out the white tie and ball gowns. (Streaming on Criterion, MAX, Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cA Muppets Christmas Carol\u201d (1992): It\u2019s one thing to do Dickens with, you know, other humans. But Michael Caine gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Ebenezer Scrooge while sharing the screen with the likes of Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. To be fair, though, Gonzo the Great and Rizzo the Rat are also really good in this. (Streaming on Disney+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d (1964): Jacques Demy\u2019s technicolor musical isn\u2019t exclusively set at Christmas, but its final tearjerker scene at that snowy gas station is enough for me. The whole candy-colored experience, from Catherine Deneuve\u2019s whimsical bows to Michel Legrand\u2019s sweeping, melancholy score just feels right around the holidays. (Streaming on The Criterion Channel) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d: Yuletide traditions don\u2019t normally include a motormouth Robert Downey Jr., but Shane Black\u2019s 2005 neo-noir black comedy is worth revisiting perennially whether or not it technically qualifies as a Christmas movie. In \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn\u2019t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz\u2019s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the \u201cmeet cute.\u201d (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d: I\u2019ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d the Christmas backdrop isn\u2019t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cKlaus\u201d: There\u2019s such a steady stream of mediocre or worse holiday movies that it can be easy to miss when a gem arrives. Sergio Pablos\u2019 2019 animated Netflix film was basically an origin story for Santa Claus by way of a desperate postman stationed in a remote northern village. Further proof, along with \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d that the best Christmas movies hinge on the postal service. (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas\u201d (2021): Clocking in at only 30 minutes, this is the perfect film for the littlest ones in the house. It\u2019s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d: Robert Benton\u2019s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It\u2019s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That\u2019s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cCarol\u201d (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn\u2019t catch Cate Blanchett\u2019s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cCarol\u201d would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, \u201cCarol\u201d is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d (1945): You don\u2019t have to watch it on TCM but it\u2019s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it\u2019s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of \u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d \u2013 that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn\u2019t that fun \u2013 has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cLittle Women\u201d (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cLittle Women\u201d just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth\u2019s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig\u2019s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) \u2014 Bahr",
      "\u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there\u2019s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn't shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says \u201cMr. Matuschek.\u201d (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d (1947): It\u2019s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton\u2019s \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It\u2019s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O\u2019Hara\u2019s single working mom, Natalie Wood\u2019s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it\u2019s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day.

      "London\u2019s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.",
      "Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\u201cI like it. There\u2019s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,\u201d said Grace Idiart, 9. \u201cIf their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.\u201d",
      "Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.",
      "Music isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It\u2019s minimalist and designed to calm.",
      "But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.",
      "Mood Media \u2013 formerly known as Muzak \u2013 develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who\u2019s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.",
      "\u201cWe see it as a soundscape,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cWe design for all of these moments.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a science to Mood Music\u2019s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.",
      "\u201cHow do we want to affect their mood at that moment?\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Here\u2019s a load of songs.\u2019 It\u2019s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.\u201d",
      "At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they\u2019re passing through.",
      "Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.",
      "Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cThe idea was like, \u2019Man, why doesn\u2019t Seattle have music? We\u2019re a music city too,\u201d Kuiken said.",
      "At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s anxiety levels are very high when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d Kuiken said. \u201cThe feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.\u201d",
      "The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.",
      "David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle\u2019s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he\u2019s gained new fans from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, \u2018That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cSo it feels like it\u2019s especially therapeutic for people.\u201d",
      "Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.",
      "Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that\u2019s meant to be actively listened to \u2013 like live music or catchy pop songs \u2013 can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports \u2013 especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.",
      "But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.",
      "\u201cA well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren\u2019t particularly cognizant of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just know they\u2019re having a good time and that it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",

      "Now caretaker of his dad's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run",
      "NEW YORK -- Only recently given stewardship over his late father's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.",
      "The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents' 1971 song \"Happy Christmas (War is Over\")\" and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album \u201cMind Games,\u201d originally released in 1973.",
      "\u201cIt feels overwhelming and surreal,\u201d said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono's interactive art project \u201cWish Tree.\u201d",
      "For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was murdered in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It's more than a preservation mission: On \u201cMind Games,\u201d he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon's music to create something entirely new.",
      "Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father's \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall's reissue of his dad's \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with \u201cMind Games.\u201d",
      "Besides the music, the innovative box is modeled after one of his mother's art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included \u2014 \u201cmind games,\u201d remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.",
      "Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he'd hear fans singing his father's music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. \u201cIt was pretty clear to me that wasn't happening with my friends,\u201d he said.",
      "His father's music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.",
      "\u201cI think I would have rebelled more against my dad's \u2014 and my mom's \u2014 music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause he wasn't around, I've always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.\u201d",
      "He inherited the job of keeping his father's music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.",
      "In liner notes for \u201cMind Games,\u201d Lennon explains that \u201cthe only meaningful way that I can show my love to him\u201d is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture's consciousness. That's poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?",
      "\u201cWhat else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?\u201d he said. \u201cI can't actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.\u201d",
      "That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. \u201cit was like the president was visiting,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Only after he began the \u201cMind Games\u201d project did Lennon learn that the album wasn't particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.",
      "That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called \u201cBrutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.\u201d In an unsigned review, the author said the \u201cMind Games\u201d reissue defines overkill. \u201cYou can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.\u201d",
      "That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn't really connect was because it wasn't promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.",
      "Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon's \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d album \u2014 most visibly on \u201cAisumasen (I'm Sorry),\u201d one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon's notorious \u201clost weekend\u201d separation from Ono.",
      "Different versions of the title cut also show Sean's approach. There's the original \u201cMind Games,\u201d with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That's stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of \u201cMake Love, Not War,\u201d a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.",
      "He didn't have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon's demo of \u201cI'm the Greatest,\u201d a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.",
      "In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father's.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who feel that it's taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThe way I look at it is, if I'm going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don't think it's helping, then I'm going to do that.\u201d",
      "For anyone who wants the original versions, they're readily available.",
      "\u201cIt's very forensic work,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not worried about what someone else is going to think. I'm just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else's music.\u201d",
      "As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described \u201cIntuition\u201d as a good song where he didn't nail the lyrics. The \u201cGet Back\u201d film of recording sessions for the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album showed the Beatles as humans who didn't hand songs down from Mount Olympus.",
      "Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the \u201cOne to One\u201d concerts involving his father and a reissue of the \u201cWalls and Bridges\u201d album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album, \u201cAsterisms,\u201d this year.",
      "Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn't want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn't hold back anymore. \u201cNow I'm too old to care,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn't get into music because I had some great talent or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",

I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture.

      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",
      "\u201cMy mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but the movie can\u2019t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,\u2019\u201d he said."

      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions.",
      "One track on \u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d is titled \u201c100,000 Voices,\" and it quite literally features that many singers.",
      "\u201cThere's like over 100,000 people on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cOver 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.\u201d",
      "His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.",
      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",
      "Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (\u201cDjesse Vol. 3\u201d was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's \u201cfolklore.\u201d) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Billie Eilish.",
      "\u201cIt's thrilling and wild,\u201d he says of the honor.",
      "\u201cThe album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,\u201d he says of \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it\u2019s a really thrilling predicament.\u201d",
      "Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be \u201ca leader of a choir,\u201d in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. \u201cI really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,\" he says. \"And if they can feel welcome, then they\u2019re a part of the music.\u201d",
      "\u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin.",
      "But now that Collier has completed the \u201cDjesse\u201d series, what's next?",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",

      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still",
      "Films that are straightforwardly about death are rare, but movies that are about both death and sex are rarer, still.",
      "In Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the Spanish director\u2019s first English-language feature film, Julianne Moore plays Ingrid, a celebrated author who\u2019s just written a book about death. She\u2019s at a book signing in New York when she hears that an old friend, a war correspondent named Martha Hunt ( Tilda Swinton ), has been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Ingrid rushes to Martha in the hospital, and the two friends, who haven\u2019t seen each other in years, quickly get reacquainted. Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",
      "During his campaign, Trump flip-flopped on abortion policy and at points attempted to distance himself from abortion opponents. Since he won the election, though, he has nominated abortion opponents to administration posts.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published this month, he gave rambling answers to questions about pills. He said he intended to maintain access but also left the door open to changing his mind.",

      "Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion ban \u201cis directly at odds\u201d with a constitutional amendment creating a right to abortion that won voter approval in the November election. The judge also blocked the state from enforcing numerous other abortion restrictions, including a 72-hour waiting period and an informed consent law that required patients to be given certain state-mandated information before receiving an abortion.",
      "But the judge declined to block several other contested abortion laws, including one requiring abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities cannot comply with some of the licensing requirements, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "\u201cWhile Planned Parenthood stands ready to start providing abortions in Missouri again as soon as the Court permits, the abortion restrictions remaining in effect \u2014 including Missouri\u2019s medically unnecessary and discriminatory clinic licensing requirement \u2013 make this impossible,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. The Missouri amendment did not specifically override any laws. Instead, advocates had to ask a court to knock down specific laws that they believe are now unconstitutional.",
      "Zhang\u2019s injunction is preliminary, but it signals that the judge is likely to ultimately find the abortion ban unconstitutional as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "Missouri had been among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, a Republican and abortion opponent, previously issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions would be legal when the amendment took effect.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Zhang declined to block several contested Missouri abortion laws, including the licensure law, another limiting only physicians to performing abortions and still another requiring in-person appointments before abortions.",
      "Among the laws blocked by Friday's order was one prohibiting abortions solely because of a diagnosis indicating Down Syndrome. Also blocked was a telemedicine ban that requires a physician to be physically present in the room while a patient takes an abortion-causing medication. And the judge barred enforcement of another law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is performed.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy."

      "A Texas man facing execution did not appear at the state Capitol after two failed attempts by lawmakers to issue a subpoena for his testimony",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A second attempt by Texas lawmakers to bring a man on death row to the state Capitol over doubts that he killed his 2-year-old daughter failed again Friday, dimming the likelihood of Robert Roberson testifying publicly after a last-minute subpoena halted his execution.",
      "Roberson, who had been scheduled to be die by lethal injection in October, would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that medical experts have questioned.",
      "The latest unsuccessful effort to have Roberson testify comes after Texas' attorney general asked a court to block a second legislative subpoena issued by lawmakers, who are running out of time until the Legislature reconvenes in January and the subpoena expires.",
      "\u201cWe have been attempting to fight accommodation since October, and they have never responded to anything meaningfully because they don\u2019t want to have Robert here,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to halt Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of killing his daughter in 2003. Prosecutors argued that he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what's called shaken baby syndrome.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and medical experts have expressed doubts over the shaken baby diagnosis used to convict Roberson and say his daughter likely died from symptoms of severe pneumonia.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has staunchly defended Roberson\u2019s conviction and said the science around shaken baby syndrome has not changed enough to absolve his guilt.",
      "In the court order, Paxton\u2019s office said that \u201cit is not the role of the Legislature to adjudicate offenses\u201d and that lawmakers overstepped their power when they halted his execution.",
      "The Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence issued their first subpoena for Roberson to testify one day before his scheduled execution \u2014 an unprecedent legal maneuver that successfully staved off his execution.",
      "A new execution date has not been set.",
      "Texas has a \u201cjunk science law\u201d that allows people wrongfully convicted on dubious science to have their sentences overturned. The House committee said they wanted Roberson to testify about this law and how they believe it has not worked as intended for his case. Criminal justice advocates say the state's highest criminal court has deliberately misinterpreted the law.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it cannot be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has maintained that Roberson was rightfully convicted. The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted unanimously to not recommend him clemency in October.",

      "Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County, home to Portland",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, according to an annual county report released Friday that officials described as showing the peak of the fentanyl crisis in the area.",
      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is underway, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits.",
      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Specialty pharmacies and online companies that have been selling off-brand copies of two blockbuster drugs for obesity and diabetes will need to phase out their versions next year under a federal decision issued Thursday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said that a nationwide shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro has been resolved, eliminating the need for copycat versions of the drugs that have become wildly popular with Americans trying to lose weight.",
      "The decision is a win for Lilly \u2014 which had been pressing the FDA to take the step for months \u2014 and is expected to impact how patients access the drugs, including how much they pay.",
      "Zepbound is FDA-approved to treat obesity and Mounjaro is approved for diabetes. They use the same active ingredient, tirzepatide.",
      "The FDA said Thursday that \u201cLilly\u2019s supply is currently meeting or exceeding demand,\u201d after two years of shortages.",
      "Both drugs are part of the GLP-1 class that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness. Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 competing drugs from Novo Nordisk \u2014 remain on the FDA\u2019s shortage list.",
      "With demand for GLP-1 drugs booming, compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies like Hims and Ro have jumped into the market, selling cheaper versions online. People can usually get a month's supply for several hundred dollars.",
      "Thursday\u2019s decision gives businesses between 60 and 90 days, depending on their size, to phase out their products.",
      "The FDA permits compounded versions of brand name drugs when they are in shortage, and the shift back to Lilly\u2019s medications could improve safety for consumers. The FDA warned patients last year about problems with the ingredients and formulations of some GLP-1 drugs sold online. The agency has limited oversight of compounding pharmacies, which are primarily overseen by state authorities.",

      "Packaged foods in the U.S. will have to follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy,\u201d according to changes finalized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",
      "The change banishes foods such as sugary cereals, highly sweetened yogurts, white bread and some granola bars from bearing a \u201chealthy\u201d label, while allowing foods such as avocados, olive oil, salmon, eggs and some trail mix to use it. Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",

      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",

      "That raises new questions about the virus, which has spread for years in wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species.",
      "The virus, also known as Type A H5N1, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation's first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said he declared the state of emergency to better position state staff and supplies to respond to the outbreak.",
      "California has been looking for bird flu in large milk tanks during processing. And they have found the virus it at least 650 herds, representing about three-quarters of all affected U.S. dairy herds.",
      "The virus was recently detected in Southern California dairy farms after being found in the state\u2019s Central Valley since August.",
      "\u201cThis proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed again this week that the virus poses low risk to the general public.",
      "Importantly, there are no reports of person-to-person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among humans.",
      "In general, flu experts agreed with that assessment, saying it\u2019s too soon to tell what trajectory the outbreak could take.",
      "\u201cThe entirely unsatisfactory answer is going to be: I don\u2019t think we know yet,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "But virus experts are wary because flu viruses are constantly mutating and small genetic changes could change the outlook.",
      "This week, health officials confirmed the first known case of severe illness in the U.S. All previous the previous U.S. cases \u2014 there have been about 60 \u2014 were generally mild.",
      "The patient in Louisiana, who is older than 65 and had underlying medical problems, is in critical condition. Few details have been released, but officials said the person developed severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock of sick birds.",
      "That makes it the first confirmed U.S. infection tied to backyard birds, the CDC said.",
      "Tests showed that the strain that caused the person's illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.",
      "Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "It's possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cI assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said.",
      "\u201cIf birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should very careful about how they handle those animals,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a public health disease expert at the University of Minnesota.",
      "The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu \u2014 and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.",
      "In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products.",
      "In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats.",
      "Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.",

      "A representative of CVS said the company has cooperated with the DOJ\u2019s investigation for more than four years, and strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d within the complaint.",
      "Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled from Oct. 17, 2013, to the present were for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and \u201ctrinity\u201d prescriptions \u2014 a dangerous combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant, according to prosecutors.",
      "CVS also allegedly filled large quantities of prescriptions for controlled substances written by prescribers it knew to be engaged in \u201cpill mill practices\u201d \u2014 that is, prescribers who issue large numbers of controlled substance prescriptions without any medical purpose, investigators said.",
      "According to the complaint, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists and internal data, indicating that its stores were dispensing such prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to exercise its critical role as gatekeeper of dangerous prescription opioids and, instead, facilitated the illegal proliferation of these highly addictive drugs, including by pill mill prescribers,\" U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha for the District of Rhode Island said in a press release.",
      "If CVS is found liable, it could face civil penalties for each unlawful prescription filled and treble damages and other penalties for each prescription reimbursed by federal health care programs.",
      "The company said it's cooperated with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe will defend ourselves vigorously against this misguided federal lawsuit, which follows on the heels of years of litigation over these issues by state and local governments \u2014 claims that already have been largely resolved by a global agreement with the participating state Attorneys General,\u201d said Amy Thibault, director of external communications for CVS in a written statement.",
      "Each of the prescriptions in question was for an FDA-approved opioid medication prescribed by a practitioner who the government itself licensed, authorized and empowered to write controlled-substance prescriptions, Thibault added.",
      "The filing of the complaint follows the announcement on Friday that the McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin.",
      "It\u2019s the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold companies accountable that officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of these deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis."

    "summary": "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
    "story": [
      "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients' privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials' push to reduce or eliminate such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe government has no place in surveilling Arizonans\u2019 medical decision-making or tracking their health history,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. \u201cStarting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.\u201d",
      "Hobbs is not the only one concerned about the collection of abortion data, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again, when he could implement policies that are hostile, or at least less favorable, to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:27 -0500",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

      "Since March, more than 60 bird flu infections in people have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",

      "Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold\u2019s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing.",
      "How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide.",
      "Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner\u2019s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight.",
      "\u201cNo more silence or complacency,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo sweeping it under the rug.\u201d",
      "In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died \u2014 what\u2019s known as the manner and cause of death.",
      "On TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d or \u201cBones,\u201d facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.",
      "That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren\u2019t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police.",
      "Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP\u2019s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use \u2014 even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

    "story": [
      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, people on Kabaena say they feel helpless.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we do if the water is like this?\u201d said Nina. \"We\u2019re small people \u2014 we can\u2019t do anything. We have to surrender.\u201d",

      "Those who heard handoffs with blame-based bias had less accurate recall than those who heard neutral handoffs (77% vs 93%, P=0.005), according to Austin Wesevich, MD, MPH, MS, of the University of Chicago, and colleagues.",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had less positive attitudes toward patients as measured by Provider Attitudes Toward Sickle Cell Patients Scale (PASS) scores after hearing biased handoffs (mean scores 22.9 vs 25.2, P<0.001), they reported in JAMA Network Open.",
      "",
      "\"People are getting it right more often when they hear the neutral [version],\" Wesevich told MedPage Today. \"It's pretty compelling that there's some sort of distraction or cognitive effect of having to neutralize out the biased phrases.\"",
      "",
      "In an invited commentary, Somnath Saha, MD, MPH, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the effect of biased language on information recall \"intriguing.\"",
      "",
      "\"At first glance, it seems that this effect might be a matter of simple distraction,\" they wrote. \"The human brain has finite capacity for retaining information, and the addition of clinically uninformative details might have crowded out information that was clinically important.\"",
      "",
      "The findings suggest that \"by engendering more negative attitudes toward the patient,\" they added, \"stigmatizing language may lessen the clinician's investment in the patient's well-being and thereby reduce the clinician's motivation to retain the information needed to provide optimal care for the patient.\"",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues surveyed 169 residents and medical students (56% female, mean age 28.6), each of whom heard three recorded handoffs, which were a combination of neutral and biased. The biased handoffs were one of three types  --  stereotype, blame, or doubt  --  and they all came from a previous study by Wesevich's group.",
      "",
      "That study involved recording residents doing handoffs, and it found that biased phrases were more common in notes about patients who were Black or obese. While they changed small details to protect patient identity, the biased handoffs are largely true to the words used in the recorded handoffs in the earlier study, Wesevich told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

      "A short while later, Fabio Ochoa was again a free man.",
      "Ochoa arrived in Bogota on a deportation flight on Monday afternoon, wearing a modest grey sweatshirt and carrying his personal belongings in a plastic bag. After stepping out of the plane, Ochoa was met by immigration officials in bullet proof vests. There were no police on site to detain him.",
      "Immigration officials took his fingerprints and confirmed through a database that Ochoa is not wanted by Colombian authorities. The country's immigration agency said on the social media platform X that Ochoa was \u201cfreed so that he could join his family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was framed,\u201d Ochoa claimed as reporters at Bogota\u2019s El Dorado Airport asked if he regretted his actions.",
      "The former cartel boss smiled as he hugged his daughter, whom he had not seen in seven years, and said he would go to Medellin to live with his family.",
      "\u201cThe nightmare is over\u201d said Ochoa, 67.",
      "Ochoa and his older brothers amassed a fortune when cocaine started flooding the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. authorities, to the point that in 1987 they were included in the Forbes Magazine\u2019s list of billionaires.",
      "Living in Miami, Ochoa ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel once headed by Pablo Escobar. Escobar died in a shootout with authorities in Medellin in 1993.",
      "Ochoa was first indicted in the U.S. for his alleged role in the 1986 killing of Barry Seal, an American pilot who flew cocaine flights for the Medellin cartel, but became an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "Along with his two older brothers, Juan David and Jorge Luis, Ochoa turned himself in to Colombian authorities in the early 1990s under a deal in which they avoided being extradited to the U.S.",
      "The three brothers were released from prison in 1996, but Ochoa was arrested again three years later for drug trafficking and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 people as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy.",
      "He was the only suspect in that group who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and a 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Ochoa\u2019s name has faded from popular memory as Mexican drug traffickers take center stage in the global drug trade.",
      "But the former member of the Medellin cartel was recently depicted in the Netflix series Griselda, where he first fights the plucky businesswoman Griselda Blanco for control of Miami's cocaine market, and then makes an alliance with the drug trafficker, played by Sofia Vergara.",
      "Ochoa is also depicted in the Netflix series Narcos, as the youngest son of an elite Medellin family that is into ranching and horse breeding and cuts a sharp contrast with Escobar, who came from more humble roots.",
      "Richard Gregorie, a retired assistant U.S. attorney who was on the prosecution team that convicted Ochoa, said authorities were never able to seize all of the Ochoa family\u2019s illicit drug proceeds and he expects that the former mafia boss will have a welcome return home.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t be retiring a poor man, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Gregorie told The Associated Press earlier this month."

The passing of our father marked the end of an era.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in India\u2019s northeast Manipur state since violence erupted last year between the majority Meitei community and minority Kuki-Zo tribes",
      "KANGPOKPI, India -- Phalneivah Khonsai ran for her life when violence struck her neighborhood in India's restive northeast, carrying just the bare essentials in the hope that she and her family could return soon.",
      "Khonsai, her husband and three children left behind their house, which was torched by a mob, and made for the hills, where thousands of people from their community headed for safety.",
      "That was in May last year. Almost 19 months later, Khonsai, 35, is still away from home, living in a government building that was turned into a relief center with squalid conditions and little privacy.",
      "The relief camp is in Kangpokpi, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Imphal, the capital of India's northeastern Manipur state, which has been wracked by ethnic violence since last year. In the building\u2019s damp and dark interior, fabric partitions separate at least 75 families like hers driven away from their homes.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to live here,\u201d Khonsai said, as women went about their daily chores such as washing clothes and dishes.",
      "The violent ethnic clashes erupted last year between the majority Meitei community and the minority Kuki-Zo tribes in Manipur. The conflict has claimed more than 250 lives and displaced at least 60,000 people.",
      "The state remains divided into two ethnic zones, one controlled by the Meiteis and the other by the Kuki-Zo community. The factions have formed armed militias that patrol roads checking for signs of their rivals. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces separate the two regions. Youths spend nights guarding vulnerable villages.",
      "Khonsai, a Kuki, said the struggles of living in a relief center are taking a toll on the family's health but they can't go back home because they fear for their lives.",
      "\u201cIf we go back, they will kill us. There is no hope for going back,\u201d she said.",
      "The Meiteis, who are predominantly Hindus, live in the Imphal Valley and nearby districts, while the Kuki-Zos live in hilly areas. The violence began last year when Meiteis demanded that they be listed by the government as a Scheduled Tribe, which would bring them more benefits such as quotas in jobs and educational institutions. That categorization would also bar non-Meiteis from buying land in the Meiteis' strongholds in the Imphal Valley.",
      "The Kukis opposed this, saying such benefits should be given only to tribal groups that are less developed economically and less educated.",
      "Soon, protests by both sides turned violent. Each side rampaged through villages, torching houses, massacring civilians and driving tens of thousands from their homes. Violence had receded in recent months, except for occasional flareups, but returned in November when 10 people were killed by paramilitary soldiers.",
      "The Kuki-Zo community has been particularly hit hard by the violence. They accuse state Chief Minister N. Biren Singh of siding with the Meiteis and have sought his removal. They now seek federal rule over the state and administrative autonomy for the community.",
      "Singh, a Meitei, has denied the accusations. His administration says people from the hill tribes \u2014 who share ethnic lineage with Myanmar\u2019s Chin tribe \u2014 are using illegal drugs to finance a war against the Hindu community. Manipur\u2019s government is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.",
      "The displacement crisis has, however, impacted both communities. While most of the displaced from the Kuki-Zo community have gone to the hills, the Meiteis have taken shelter in refugee camps in Imphal. The mistrust between the two communities is far from over, with people from each side unable to venture into the other\u2019s zone.",
      "Yengsom Junksom Memi, a Meitei, used to live in Kangpokpi until attackers rampaged her home and forced her family to run for their lives. Memi first took refuge in a police station before moving to a relief center in Imphal where she lives with 600 other displaced Meiteis. She said her house has been taken over by the attackers.",
      "\u201cWe have no future left. It is difficult to even manage food in the morning and evening,\u201d Memi said.",
      "Ngamminlun Kipgen, spokesperson for the Committee on Tribal Unity, which represents Kukis, blamed the federal government for failing to end the violence.",
      "\u201cI think the prime minister needs to intervene,\" Kipgen said.",
      "India's opposition parties have been urging Modi to visit Manipur. Modi has not visited the state since the violence started but has instructed his home minister, Amit Shah, to find a solution.",
      "Kipgen said a division of the state into two separately administered parts, one for the Kukis and the other for Meiteis, could calm the situation.",
      "\u201cThe nation must understand that the Kukis and the Meiteis for the time being are not able to live together, so the state or the central government should not force both communities at this critical juncture to come together,\u201d Kipgen said."

      "A biologist hid 350 audio monitors across Costa Rica\u2019s tropical rainforests to spy on endangered spider monkeys in order to help protect them",
      "PUERTO JIM\u00c9NEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey\u2019s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.",
      "So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.",
      "The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.",
      "Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world\u2019s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.",
      "More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can \u201chandle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies\u201d that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.",
      "Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.",
      "\u201cThose remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.",
      "Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.",
      "Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation \u2014 and efforts to reverse it \u2014 is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.",
      "Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be \u201copen-sourced\u201d to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.",
      "\u201cShe basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,\u201d said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim C\u00f3rdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.",
      "Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica \u2014 spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cThe spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there\u2019s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.\u201d",
      "The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.",
      "After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared \u2014 peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again \u2014 extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.",
      "Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.",
      "Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.",
      "Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.",

      "The Conference Board said Monday that its consumer confidence index fell back in December to 104.7 from 112.8 in November. Analysts forecast a rise to a reading of 113.8. Consumers had been feeling increasingly confident in recent months, spending more in the run-up to the all-important holiday shopping season.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans\u2019 assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.",
      "The measure of Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for income, business and the job market tumbled more than a dozen points to 81.1. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next 12 months remained stable.",
      "The board reported Monday that consumers\u2019 view of current conditions ticked down just more than a point to a reading of 140.2.",
      "Consumers stepped up their spending at retail stores last month, contributing to a 0.7% rise in retail sales in November.",
      "Another report showed that consumers increased their spending by a solid 0.4% from October to November, a sign that households continue to propel the economy. The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 3.1% annual rate last quarter, largely thanks to consumer demand.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:42:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a &ldquo;total failure.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy \u201cmoonscape\u201d unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents.",
      "That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed.",
      "A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.",
      "There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water.",
      "Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on.",
      "\u201cWe bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,\u201d said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. \u201cNo way to survive with our children again.\u201d",
      "Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries.",
      "After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role.",
      "To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground.",
      "But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a \u201ccomplete absence of topsoil\u201d and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits.",
      "The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP.",
      "The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents \u201cbaseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful.",
      "But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief.",
      "A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites.",
      "They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups.",
      "In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep\u2019s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites.",
      "Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained.",
      "Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests.",
      "In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab\u2019s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice.",
      "Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to.",
      "The U.N. cited another problem \u2014 contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a \u201cblank check,\u201d U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell.",
      "The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cdemonized for doing their job.\u201d Shekwolo\u2019s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and \u201cphysically prevented\u201d auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment.",
      "Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to \u201ccorrect the identified weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria\u2019s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako\u2019s office declined an interview.",
      "Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep\u2019s alleged failings and determined to address them.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proper remediation being done,\u201d she told the AP in a phone interview. \u201cThe companies had no competence whatsoever.\u201d",
      "In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of \u201csignificant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,\u201d in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians.",
      "The \u201cmajority\u201d of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies \u201cwouldn\u2019t get the big jobs.\u201d",
      "One of Shekwolo\u2019s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo\u2019s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of.",
      "When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies.",
      "\u201cThat sent shockwaves around the political class,\u201d said Ikeazor. \u201cThey all had interests.\"",
      "\"That was when the battle started,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months.",
      "Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn\u2019t like him.",
      "Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June.",
      "Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn\u2019t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization.",
      "Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on.",

      "The move could usher in an end to a protracted political crisis in the European Union country following the annulment of a presidential election by a top court. Parliament approved the new administration in a 240-143 vote in Romania's 466-seat legislature.",
      "The new coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the center-right National Liberal Party, PNL, the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party and national minorities. It caps a month-long period of turmoil in which far-right nationalists made significant gains in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, a week after a first-round presidential race saw the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerge as the front-runner.",
      "\u201cIt will not be an easy mandate for the future government,\u201d Ciolacu, whose PSD party topped the polls in the parliamentary election, said in a statement Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that we are in the midst of a deep political crisis,\" he said. \"It is also a crisis of trust, and this coalition aims to regain the trust of citizens, the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Romani's 16 ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a slim majority in the legislature. It's widely seen as a tactical partnership to shut out far-right nationalists whose voices found fertile ground amid high living costs and a sluggish economy.",
      "Ciolacu, who came third in the first-round presidential ballot despite polls indicating he would win the most votes, has served as prime minister since June 2023.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, President Klaus Iohannis swore in the new government and warned the new Cabinet that it's entering a \u201cdifficult new period\u201d in which \u201cfor many Romanians, there are major concerns.\u201d",

Honda will lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. They aim to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said.",
      "No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said.",
      "There are \u201cpoints that need to be studied and discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.\u201d",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",

If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "\u201cWe have come to the realization that in order for both parties to be leaders in this mobility transformation, it is necessary to make a more bold change than a collaboration in specific areas,\u201d Mibe said.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi earlier agreed to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to electrification.",
      "Nissan has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",

      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut while acknowledging responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\u201d Uchida said.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan\u2019s credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price also had fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",

    "story": [
      "The economic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player in America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader.",
      "As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded \u2014 something he did after Hurricane Helene.",
      "Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete.",
      "It\u2019s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that\u2019s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China.",
      "Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas.",
      "A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones.",
      "A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren\u2019t comparable, they say.",
      "In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said.",
      "\u201cWith the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,\u201d Hedrick said.",
      "But it\u2019s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers.",
      "\u201cIt is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,\u201d argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones.",
      "It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.",
      "Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could \u201cgather data or carry harmful payloads\u201d across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.",
      "He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing.",
      "That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China.",
      "\u201cThis is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world\u2019s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,\u201d wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio.",
      "Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment.",
      "John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts.",
      "For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. \u201cIf we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.\u201d",
      "The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics.",
      "DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.",
      "DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people.",
      "Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies.",
      "\u201cI am not going to say I won\u2019t love to have U.S. drones, but I don\u2019t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cThe U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.\u201d",
      "But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military.",
      "DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it \u201ca customs-related misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. \u201cWe call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,\u201d DJI said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries\u2019 frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,\u201d Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement.",
      "Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones.",
      "That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500.",
      "\u201cBasically it would be a DJI clone but doesn\u2019t have all the capabilities,\u201d Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. \u201cIt's about life and death,\u201d he said.",
      "In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses.",
      "He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones.",
      "At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the \u201closs of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,\" according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models.",
      "Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as \u201can absolute mess.\"",
      "\u201cLawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,\" he said. \u201cYou need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.\"",
      "But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said.",
      "More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group.",
      "In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state.",
      "\u201cThe transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",

      "Donald Trump is suggesting that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump suggested Sunday that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal that the United States \u201cfoolishly\u201d ceded to its Central American ally, contending that shippers are charged \u201cridiculous\u201d fees to pass through the vital transportation channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.",
      "Panama's conservative president Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who was elected in May on a pro-business platform, roundly rejected that notion as an affront to his country's sovereignty.",
      "The Republican president-elect's comment came during his first major rally since winning the White House on Nov. 5. He also basked in his return to power as a large audience of conservatives cheered along. It was a display of party unity at odds with a just-concluded budget fight on Capitol Hill, where some GOP lawmakers openly defied their leader's demands.",
      "Addressing supporters at Turning Point USA\u2019s AmericaFest in Arizona, Trump pledged that his \u201cdream team Cabinet\u201d would deliver a booming economy, seal U.S. borders and quickly settle wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI can proudly proclaim that the Golden Age of America is upon us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a spirit that we have now that we didn\u2019t have just a short while ago.\u201d",
      "His appearance capped a four-day pep rally that drew more than 20,000 activists and projected an image of Republican cohesion despite the past week's turbulence in Washington with Trump pulling strings from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as Congress worked to avoid a government shutdown heading into the holidays.",
      "House Republicans spiked a bipartisan deal after Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally, expressed their opposition on social media. Budget hawks flouted Trump's demand that they raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, which would have spared some new rounds of the same fight after he takes office on Jan. 20, with Republicans holding narrow control of the House and Senate. The final agreement did not address the issue and there was no shutdown.",
      "Trump, in his remarks in Phoenix, did not mention the congressional drama, though he did reference Musk's growing power. To suggestions that \"President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon,\u201d Trump made clear, \u201cNo, no. That\u2019s not happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be president,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president-elect opened the speech by saying that \"we want to try to bring everybody together. We\u2019re going to try. We\u2019re going to really give it a shot.\" Then he suggested Democrats have \u201clost their confidence\u201d and are \u201cbefuddled\u201d after the election but eventually will \u201dcome over to our side because we want to have them.\u201d",
      "Atop a list of grievances \u2014 some old, some new \u2014 was the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being ripped off at the Panama Canal,\u201d he said, bemoaning that his country \u201dfoolishly gave it away.\u201d",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "The canal depends on reservoirs to operate its locks and was heavily affected by 2023 Central American droughts that forced it to substantially reduce the number of daily slots for crossing ships. With fewer ships using the canal each day, administrators also increased the fees that are charged all shippers for reserving a slot.",
      "With weather returning to normal in the later months of this year, transit on the canal has normalized. But price increases are still expected for next year.",
      "Mulino, Panama's president, has been described as a conservative populist who aligns with Trump on many issues. Panama is a strong U.S. ally and the canal is crucial for its economy, generating about one-fifth of that government\u2019s annual revenue.",
      "Still, Trump said, that, once his second term is underway, \"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand for it,\" Trump said. \"So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.\u201d",
      "He did not explain how that would be possible.",
      "Shortly after Trump's speech, Mulino released a video declaring that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong\u201d to his country.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, Mulino addressed Trump's complaints over rising fees for ships crossing the canal, saying they are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are not set on a whim\u201d Mulino said. He noted that Panama has expanded the canal over the years to increase ship traffic \u201con its own initiative,\u201d and added that shipping fee increases help pay for improvements.",
      "\u201cPanamanians may have different views on many issues\u201d Mulino said. \u201cBut when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.\u201d",
      "Trump then took to his social media site to offer in response, \u201cWe'll see about that!\" He also posted a picture of a U.S. flag planted in the canal zone under the phrase, \u201cWelcome to the United States Canal!\u201d",
      "The canal aside, Trump\u2019s appearance at Turning Point\u2019s annual gathering affirmed the growing influence the group and its founder, Charlie Kirk, have had in the conservative movement. Kirk\u2019s group hired thousands of field organizers across presidential battlegrounds, helping Trump make key gains among infrequent voters and other groups of people that have trended more Democratic in recent decades, including younger voters, Black men and Latino men.",
      "\u201dYou had Turning Point\u2019s grassroots armies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my victory, it\u2019s your victory.\u201d",
      "Trump on Sunday also announced several new members of his incoming administration, most notably:",
      "-Stephen Miran, who worked at the Treasury Department in Trump's first term, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, an executive branch agency charged with providing objective economic advice to the president.",
      "\u2014Callista Gingrich to be the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland. Gingrich was U.S. ambassador to the Holy See in Trump's first term. She is married to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Separately, Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt announced he was donating $1.1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund to complement the $14 million that he said he already had given to the Make America Great Again Inc. super political action committee \u2014 making him one of the president-elect\u2019s top donors.",
      "Pratt is chairman of Pratt Industries, which uses recycled paper and boxes as a raw material in a process that produces new cardboard.",

      "Party City announced Saturday that it would start a \u201cwind down\u201d of its retail and wholesale operations as it prepares to shutter nearly 700 stores nationwide. The company has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than two years \u201cto maximize value for the benefit of the company\u2019s stakeholders.\u201d",

      "The New Jersey-based retailer said it will keep more than 95% of its 12,000 employees to help with the process of shutting down.",
      "Party City has faced growing competition from Walmart and Target and increasingly from occasion-based pop-up stores such as Spirit Halloween, which announced in October that it would also open 10 Spirit Christmas stores. That pressure has intensified in an era of rising prices, including for helium used in party balloons, and slowing consumer demand.",
      "The competition has also hit other retailers: Last week, discount chain Big Lots said it would start going-out-of-business sales at its remaining locations after a sale of the company didn\u2019t materialize. Party City's website similarly shows going-out-of-business discounts of up to 50% on the shop's entire assortment goods."

      "Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.",
      "The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.",
      "They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.",
      "And every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls \u2014 ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking.",
      "On a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done \u2014 going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one.",

      "Why?",
      "\u201cMy dad was a clock collector growing up,\u201d Gill said. \u201cAnd every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.\u201d",

      "Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.",
      "\u201cThe clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,\u201d said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. \u201cThe mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.\u201d",
      "Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.",
      "Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.",
      "While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.",

      "TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's prime minister said Saturday the government will shut down the video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children.",
      "Albanian authorities held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents following the stabbing death of a teenager in mid-November by another teen after a quarrel that started on TikTok.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama, speaking at a meeting with teachers and parents, said TikTok \u201cwould be fully closed for all. ... There will be no TikTok in the Republic of Albania.\" Rama said the shutdown would begin sometime next year.",
      "It was not immediately clear if TikTok has a contact in Albania.",
      "TikTok in an email response Saturday to a request for comment asked for \u201curgent clarity from the Albanian government\u201d on the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had \"found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.\u201d",
      "Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers.",
      "There has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok.",
      "TikTok's operations in China, where its parent company is based, are different, \u201cpromoting how to better study, how to preserve nature ... and so on,\u201d according to Rama.",
      "Albania is too small a country to impose on TikTok a change of its algorithm so that it does not promote \u201cthe reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on,\" Rama\u2019s office wrote in an email response to The Associated Press' request for comment. Rama's office said that in China TikTok \"prevents children from being sucked into this abyss.\u201d",
      "Authorities have set up a series of protective measures at schools, starting with an increased police presence, training programs and closer cooperation with parents.",
      "Rama said Albania would follow how the company and other countries react to the one-year shutdown before deciding whether to allow the company to resume operations in Albania.",
      "Not everyone agreed with Rama\u2019s decision to close TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe dictatorial decision to close the social media platform TikTok ... is a grave act against freedom of speech and democracy,\u201d said Ina Zhupa, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party. \u201cIt is a pure electoral act and abuse of power to suppress freedoms.\u201d",
      "Albania holds parliamentary elections next year.",

      "Johnny Zuagar says he\u2019s tried to hide his worries about a potential government shutdown from his three boys as he weighs how much to spend on Christmas presents",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Johnny Zuagar says he\u2019s tried to hide his worries about a potential government shutdown from his three boys as he weighs how much to spend on Christmas presents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to keep a poker face,\u201d Zuagar, a statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, said when thinking about his boys, ages 14, 12 and 6. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to take that worry off of your family.\u201d",
      "Like thousands of federal workers, Zuagar is navigating the holidays with the spirit of the season overtaken by an air of gloom and uncertainty.",
      "The turbulent efforts in Congress to reach an agreement on funding the federal government have cast a cloud over the holidays for many federal workers facing possible furloughs in the days before Christmas. The House on Friday passed a three-month government spending bill just hours before a government shutdown, but its fate in the Senate was uncertain as the deadline loomed.",
      "Many federal workers were already anxious about the possibility of future workforce reductions under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Zuagar, who is president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782, which represents federal workers at the census, has lived through unexpected shutdowns before \u2014 including right before the holidays.",
      "This time, it comes on the heels of promises from Trump and his allies that there will be sweeping cuts in the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cWe really don\u2019t know anymore,\" Zuagar said during a telephone interview Friday, with hours to go before a midnight deadline to approve a spending measure to avoid furloughs. \u201cAgain, the rhetoric out there is that federal employees are the problem.\u201d",
      "The contentiousness of the current debate has left him wondering: \"Are we the scapegoat for every ill and grievance in America?\"",
      "He says federal workers are worried not just about how long a potential shutdown could last, but also about what will happen after Trump takes office.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re fearful of what\u2019s to come, like this is the beginning of something, or they don\u2019t care about us,\" Zuagar said.",
      "Jesus Soriano, president of the AFGE Local 3403 representing workers at the National Science Foundation and several other agencies, also said the budget difficulties in Congress feel different from those of previous years.",
      "\u201cI think Americans should know that history is being written as we speak,\" Soriano said in an interview in Chevy Chase, Maryland, near the state's border with the nation's capital. \"Americans need to decide what type of services the government should provide, whether we are talking about national security, the safety of our borders, the safety of our food, Social Security or others.\u201d",
      "Anxiety about furloughs from a government shutdown this time could be a prelude, Soriano said.",
      "\u201cFederal employees that we represent in the American Federation of Government Employees are scared for the jobs, given the public discourse that we are all witnessing,\" Soriano said.",
      "Mac Johnson, a retired Transportation Security Administration employee who is now an executive vice president for the union's TSA Council, said TSA employees were on \u201cpins and needles\u201d Friday afternoon.",
      "Johnson said about half the TSA's workforce was on the job during the 2018 shutdown. While TSA employees would still work at the nation's airports during a shutdown, there's a chance they would not be paid until a government funding measure is approved.",
      "That's hard to bear when many employees live paycheck to paycheck.",
      "\u201cIt is a double whammy,\" Johnson said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. \"One, you\u2019re not getting paid, and I think it\u2019s going to affect the ability of any federal agency, not only TSA. You know, once upon a time, there was job security working for the federal government, but going through all of these shutdowns does not do a lot for the confidence of those potential candidates for future government employment.\u201d",
      "Zuagar said he's more confused about the budget debate this time around than in previous years.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is just all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these different factions of people.\u201d",
      "Government shutdowns not only are demoralizing to federal workers, Soriano said, but recovery takes a long time. For individuals, savings are depleted, spending is deferred and some things that once seemed necessary are suddenly out of reach.",
      "For government agencies, a lot has to be rebuilt.",
      "\u201cSo, it is not that the shutdown disappears, and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cIt takes time and effort to put a shutdown into place. It takes even more time to address all the deficiencies created by a shutdown.\u201d",
      "Despite the anxiety, Zuagar says he's avoiding blaming anyone specifically for the turbulent negotiations. For now, he's trying to be optimistic that what he's hearing is mostly rhetoric, and support for funding federal employees and the services they provide will be there.",
      "Still, he said it's \u201cshocking\u201d to be blindsided by a crisis right before the holiday. He said he would receive his last paycheck until the impasse is resolved this weekend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your last paycheck before Christmas, so for some of us, for myself, you\u2019ve got to think: Do I spend it on Christmas gifts for my family, or do I hold some of that?\u201d Zuagar said. \"Because we\u2019ve also got to pay our bills in January. It will affect people in the sense of how they spend this weekend.\u201d",
      "That's the kind of thing he wishes lawmakers would remember as they negotiate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s real people behind all this stuff, and our hope is that, you know, they think about that,\" Zuagar said.",

      "The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer, which sells furniture, home decor and other items, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early September and said private equity firm Nexus Capital Management LP had agreed to acquire \u201csubstantially all of the company\u2019s assets.\u201d But on Thursday the chain said it didn't anticipate completing the purchase agreement. It said it continues to work toward completing an alternative transaction with Nexus or another party.",

      "Big Lots said it is continuing to serve customers in-store and online, and will provide updates as available.",
      "Big Lots has said that high inflation and interest rates have hurt its business as consumers have pulled back on their home and seasonal product purchases, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue. The company has also struggled with increased competition from the likes of Walmart and warehouse clubs like Walmart's Sam's Clubs and Costco, which have all sharpened their pricing and merchandise.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Volkswagen and its employee representatives said Friday they have reached a wage deal for 120,000 German workers that avoids plant closings and bars involuntary layoffs through 2030. The agreement includes provisions for VW to shed more than 35,000 jobs through early retirement and buyouts by 2030.",
      "The deal, reached in drawn-out bargaining sessions that stretched late into the night, is aimed at enabling the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to cope with a drop in demand in Europe, higher raw-material costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.",
      "Lagging sales in Europe mean the company has lost potential sales of 500,000 cars a year, or the output of two factories.",
      "The deal would save VW 1.5 billion euros ($1.56 billion) a year in labor costs and 4 billion euros a year by slashing manufacturing capacity by more 700,000 vehicles across its German plants through different production arrangements.",
      "That the agreement avoids wholesale plant closings underscores the role played at Volkswagen by employee representatives and the state of Lower Saxony, who together have majority on the board of directors. That gives workers and the local government unusual leverage.",
      "A top Volkswagen executive called it \u201ca good agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had three priorities in the negotiations: reducing overcapacity in German locations, reducing labor costs and bringing development costs down to a competitive level,\u201d said Thomas Schaefer, head of the company's namesake Volkswagen brand.",
      "\u201cWe reached sustainable solutions in all three areas.\u201d",
      "Thorsten Groeger, negotiator for the IG Metall union, said employees also accepted \u201cpainful concessions.\" A union statement said that the loss of bonus payments and other compensation were part of the deal but that monthly wage levels would not be touched.

      "Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America.",
      "Though major plant closings were avoided, a factory in Dresden will cease production at the end of next year as previous planned, and a plant in Osnabrueck is to produce T-Roc SUVs only through the middle of 2027.

Top Volkswagen employee representative Daniela Cavallo said the Dresden plant could be repurposed \u201calso in cooperation with other organizations\u201d that she didn't specify.",

      "For small businesses, the biggest change in the new year will be the arrival of a presumably more business-friendly administration in Washington. But there are other shifts owners should keep on their radar.",
      "Among them: changes to state-level overtime and minimum wage rules, the delayed federal FinCEN registration, taxes on payments from third-party providers like Venmo and PayPal, and anything that might affect inflation, including tariffs.",
      "The Small Business Administration is also ushering in a new leader, Trump loyalist Kelly Loeffler, assuming she\u2019s confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\u201cI think there a general sense that there is going to be obviously a pro-business administration on the regulatory side,\u201d said Karen Kerrigan, President and CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, an advocacy group. \u201cBut there could be some nuances specifically on, say, workplace or labor rules. But that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what small business owners should keep in mind in 2025.",
      "Inflation remains a wild card for 2025. Inflation has retreated from its peak of 7.2% in June 2022, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, standing at 2.3% in October. Moves by the Federal Reserve and the incoming Trump administration are likely to swing inflation one way or another.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its projection for the inflation rate for 2025 to 2.5% from a prior estimate of 2.1% issued in September. The Fed also forecast just two rate cuts for the year, down from four. Sticky inflation and high rates could mean higher costs for both consumers and businesses.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts \u2014 on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income \u2014 as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs on imports and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation.",
      "Either way, inflation is certain to remain top of mind for small business owners.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for the past two-and-a-half years is that inflation is the top concern for small business,\u201d said Tom Sullivan, vice president of small business policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thinking about 2025, there is a significant question on whether or not the incoming president\u2019s policies are going to bring inflation down.\u201d",
      "Established in 1953, the SBA has been through many different administrations. The agency offers resources to small businesses and helps administer small business and disaster recovery loans. It played a crucial role during the pandemic, helping distribute small business aid.",
      "Trump said he would nominate Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. Senator from Georgia, as the head of the SBA, pending confirmation. She replaces Isabella Casillas Guzman, who has served as the administrator since 2021. A staunch Trump loyalist, Loeffler is also co-chair of his inaugural committee.",
      "Loeffler hasn\u2019t made any statement about plans for the SBA.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any sort of dramatic change or shifts in terms lending and some of those programs, I think that will happen over time,\u201d said SBE Council's Kerrigan.",
      "While a national federal rule expanding overtime coverage to millions of Americans was blocked by a federal judge in November, several states still have an overtime threshold increase going into effect, and those aren\u2019t affected by the block.",
      "Six states are raising their threshold for overtime pay: Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, New York and Washington. For example, in Alaska, the state threshold to be exempt from overtime pay will rise from $48,796.80 in 2024 to $54,080 on July 1.",
      "\u201cEmployers will need to be aware of those thresholds and make sure that they\u2019re complying with state law if they have employees in any of those states,\u201d said Tyler Yamnik, an employment attorney and human resources consultant for HR firm Engage PEO.",
      "Meanwhile, 23 states and 65 cities and counties have minimum wage increases set to go into effect in 2025, either Jan. 1 or later in the year.",
      "Rich Kingly, CEO of Driveway King in Garwood, N.J., which renovates pathways and driveways, said he\u2019s watching the state-specific minimum wage changes.",
      "\u201cAs we operate in multiple states, staying compliant with each state\u2019s rules and regulations is an ongoing challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cAs minimum wage rates rise, it adds to the financial pressures of running a business, especially in the face of fluctuating material costs and competitive pricing.\u201d",
      "A rule that would require millions of small businesses to register with an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1 is currently temporarily blocked in court.",
      "The registration is part of the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money laundering statue passed in 2021.\u202fRegistering isn\u2019t difficult. The owners and part-owners of those businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address.",
      "But small business groups say the regulation is too onerous. If it goes into effect, small businesses that don\u2019t comply could be fined up to $10,000. Businesses with more than 20 employees and more than $5 million in sales can qualify for exemptions.",
      "Steve DiMatteo, CEO of e-commerce site Cleveland Vintage Shirts, said he had trouble tracking down information about the registration because government communication was lacking. He sought guidance from an X account that helps small businesses.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern stems from this experience -- what other rules and regulations am I going to miss because of a lack of clear communication from the government, either at the state or federal level?,\u201d he said.",
      "Another regulation that has been on small businesses' radar for several years is taxes on payments via third-party apps like PayPal, Cash App, Venmo and similar platforms.",
      "Traditionally, the threshold to report earnings from payments from third-party apps was $20,000 and 200 transactions. But the American Rescue Act drastically lowered that to $600 and over with no transaction minimum.",
      "The regulation was delayed for the past two years, but small businesses paying taxes for 2024 will now be required to pay taxes on anything over $5,000 as part of a phase-in to eventually implement the $600 reporting threshold."

      "OpenAI added, however, it remained \u201ccommitted to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.\u201d",

    "summary": "Approaching a midnight deadline, the Senate is preparing to give final approval to a new plan to prevent a government shutdown",
    "story": [
      "Approaching a midnight deadline, the Senate is preparing to give final approval to a new plan to prevent a government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- Approaching a midnight government shutdown deadline, the Senate set up votes toward final passage late Friday of a new plan that would temporarily fund federal operations and disaster aid, but drops President-elect Donald Trump's demands for a debt limit increase into the new year.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson had insisted Congress would \u201cmeet our obligations\u201d and not allow federal operations to shutter ahead of the Christmas holiday season. But the day's outcome was uncertain after Trump doubled down on his insistence that a debt ceiling increase be included in any deal \u2014 if not, he said in an early morning post, let the closures \u201cstart now.\u201d",
      "The House approved Johnson's new bill overwhelmingly, 366-34. As the Senate worked into the night, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that senators had reached agreement that would skip past procedural hurdles and allow them to pass the funding bill \u201cbefore the midnight deadline.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a good outcome for the country, \u201d Johnson said after the House vote, adding he had spoken with Trump and the president-elect \u201cwas certainly happy about this outcome, as well.\u201d",
      "It was the third attempt from Johnson, the beleaguered House speaker, to achieve one of the basic requirements of the federal government \u2014 keeping it open. And it raised stark questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job, in the face of angry GOP colleagues, and work alongside Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who called the legislative plays from afar.",
      "President Joe Biden, who has played a less public role in the process throughout a turbulent week, was expected to quickly sign the measure into law.",
      "Trump's last-minute demand was almost an impossible ask, and Johnson had almost no choice but to work around his pressure for a debt ceiling increase. The speaker knew there wouldn\u2019t be enough support within the GOP majority to pass any funding package, since many Republican deficit hawks prefer to slash federal government and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow more debt.",
      "Instead, the Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate next year, with big plans for tax cuts and other priorities, are showing they must routinely rely on Democrats for the votes needed to keep up with the routine operations of governing.",
      "\u201cSo is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?\u201d scoffed Musk on social media ahead of the vote.",
      "The drastically slimmed-down 118-page package would fund the government at current levels through March 14 and add $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in agricultural assistance to farmers.",
      "Gone is Trump\u2019s demand to lift the debt ceiling, which GOP leaders told lawmakers would be debated as part of their tax and border packages in the new year. Republicans made a so-called handshake agreement to raise the debt limit at that time while also cutting $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 years.",
      "It\u2019s essentially the same deal that flopped the night before in a spectacular setback \u2014 opposed by most Democrats and some of the most conservative Republicans \u2014 minus Trump\u2019s debt ceiling demand.",
      "But it's far smaller than the original bipartisan accord Johnson struck with Democratic and Republican leaders \u2014 a 1,500-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected, forcing him to start over. It was stuffed with a long list of other bills \u2014 including much-derided pay raises for lawmakers \u2014 but also other measures with broad bipartisan support that now have a tougher path to becoming law.",
      "House Democrats were cool to the latest effort after Johnson reneged on the hard-fought bipartisan compromise.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said it looked like Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, was calling the shots for Trump and Republicans.",
      "\u201cWho is in charge?\u201d she asked during the debate.",
      "Still, the Democrats put up more votes than Republicans for the bill's passage. Almost three dozen conservative Republicans voted against it.",
      "\u201cThe House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy and hurting working-class Americans all across the nation,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote, referring to Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.",
      "Trump, who has not yet been sworn into office, is showing the power but also the limits of his sway with Congress, as he intervenes and orchestrates affairs from Mar-a-Lago alongside Musk, who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The incoming Trump administration vows to slash the federal budget and fire thousands of employees and is counting on Republicans for a big tax package. And Trump's not fearful of shutdowns the way lawmakers are, having sparked the longest government shutdown in history in his first term at the White House.",
      "\u201cIf there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now,\u201d Trump posted early in the morning on social media.",
      "More important for the president-elect was his demand for pushing the thorny debt ceiling debate off the table before he returns to the White House. The federal debt limit expires Jan. 1, and Trump doesn't want the first months of his new administration saddled with tough negotiations in Congress to lift the nation's borrowing capacity. Now Johnson will be on the hook to deliver.",
      "\u201cCongress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,\u201d Trump posted \u2014 increasing his demand for a new five-year debt limit increase. \"Without this, we should never make a deal.\"",
      "Government workers had already been told to prepare for a federal shutdown that would send millions of employees \u2014 and members of the military \u2014 into the holiday season without paychecks.",
      "Biden has been in discussions with Jeffries and Schumer, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \u201cRepublicans blew up this deal. They did, and they need to fix this.\u201d",
      "As the day dragged on, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stepped in to remind colleagues \u201chow harmful it is to shut the government down, and how foolish it is to bet your own side won\u2019t take the blame for it.\u201d",
      "At one point, Johnson asked House Republicans at a lunchtime meeting for a show of hands as they tried to choose the path forward.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the shutdown, but the speaker\u2019s job on the line. The speaker\u2019s election is the first vote of the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, and some Trump allies have floated Musk for speaker.",
      "Johnson said he spoke to Musk ahead of the vote Friday and they talked about the \u201cextraordinary challenges of this job.\u201d",

      "NORFOLK, Va. -- To shouts of \u201cCoach\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go Spartans,\u201d Michael Vick was introduced Monday as Norfolk State\u2019s football coach, a homecoming for the former NFL star and a splashy, attention-grabbing hire for a program that has struggled in recent years.",
      "Vick, who grew up about 30 minutes away in Newport News, donned a Norfolk State letterman\u2019s jacket and cap in front of a crowd of supporters that included fellow Hampton Roads, Virginia, sports greats Allen Iverson and Bruce Smith.",
      "Vick\u2019s introduction was the culmination of whirlwind courtship, the timing of which took even Vick by surprise.",
      "\u201cI was talking to my high school coach a couple weeks ago, and I told him I wanted to be a football coach one day, a couple years from now,\u201d he said.",
      "Vick said he then got a surprise call from former Virginia Tech football player Aaron Rouse, who is now a Virginia state senator, and Norfolk State athletic director Melody Webb, gauging his interest in becoming the Spartans\u2019 coach.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the easiest decision to make,\u201d Vick said. \u201cI\u2019ve got family that I considered, I care about and I love. This requires a lot of change in lifestyle. But at the same time, it allows me to serve young men in my community.\u201d",
      "Vick led Virginia Tech to the national championship game as a redshirt freshman and was selected No. 1 overall in the 2001 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons. A three-time Pro Bowl pick in six seasons in Atlanta, he revolutionized the quarterback position with his dynamic running ability.",
      "Vick\u2019s career was derailed by his conviction in 2007 for his involvement in a dogfighting ring. He pleaded guilty and served 21 months in federal prison before resuming his career in 2009. He retired in 2017 and had been working as an NFL analyst for Fox Sports and as an animal rights activist.",
      "Vick\u2019s legal troubles were not mentioned Monday, except indirectly by Webb, who praised his ability to \u201cinspire and overcome challenges\u201d and said it is in keeping with the values the school wants to instill in its student-athletes.",
      "\u201cHis journey is one of resilience and redemption and unwavering commitment to growth,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Vick has no coaching experience and is the latest former NFL star who had not coached before to take the helm of an HBCU program, a club that includes Deion Sanders and Eddie George.",
      "Norfolk State has made only one playoff appearance since moving to FCS in 1997. The last five Spartan head coaches have had losing records, including Dawson Odoms, who was fired in November after going 15-30 in four seasons.",
      "School officials hailed Vick\u2019s hiring as transformational, however. Webb said Vick\u2019s name \u201cresonates around the world.\u201d",
      "Added rector Kim Brown: \u201cToday we turn the corner and we embrace a new season for our football program.\u201d",
      "For his part, Vick said he won\u2019t be outworked, and that he will recruit hard in his home region, long a hotbed of talent. He said he attended Norfolk State games while playing youth football in Newport News and has followed the program over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure being in your hometown,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thrived off it.\u201d",

      "Coach Kirby Smart said Monday that Georgia is preparing Stockton to start in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal against No. 3 Notre Dame. Stockton took over when starter Carson Beck suffered a right elbow injury in the the first half in the Bulldogs\u2019 22-19 overtime win over Texas in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Dec. 7 in Atlanta.",
      "Georgia's first-round bye in the playoffs has given Stockton, a sophomore, more time to prepare for his new starting role. Smart said the experience with the first-team is the primary benefit in \u201cseveral practices\u201d since the SEC championship game.",
      "\u201cHe got lots of reps prior to these practices, but he\u2019s getting much more now,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI do think ... when you get ready for an opponent like Notre Dame, you need time and we have time.\u201d",
      "The Fighting Irish advanced by beating Indiana 27-17 in the first round on Friday night. Smart said Stockton and Georgia can focus on Notre Dame.",

      "Georgia announced on Dec. 9 that Beck and his family were considering treatment options for his elbow. Those options could include surgery, though Georgia has not released details about the injury.",
      "Two weeks later, no decision has been released by Beck or Georgia.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I can update is that they\u2019re still going through those deliberations in terms of the decision-making process time, all the kind of decisions they have to make as a family,\u201d Smart said.",
      "Beck suffered the injury to his throwing arm in the first half of the SEC championship game and made a dramatic return to the field for the handoff on the game-winning play in overtime. Stockton had to leave the field for one play after having his helmet knocked off.",

      "Stockton completed 12 of 16 passes for 71 yards with one interception against Texas.",
      "Smart downplayed the suggestion Stockton could give the Bulldogs more options as a running quarterback.",
      "\u201cI think we are who we are in regards to that,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI mean, we played an entire season, offensively. You know, Gunner\u2019s a good athlete. I think Carson is a good athlete. So it\u2019s one of those deals that I don\u2019t know how much that changes things.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the NCAA to block the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, arguing that it tricks and misleads fans.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state district court in Lubbock and announced Sunday, argues the NCAA violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by promoting women's sports that may include a transgender athlete. The law is designed to protect consumers from being misled or tricked into buying products or services that are not as advertised, the lawsuit said.",
      "The Texas lawsuit is the latest attempt by conservative politicians to target transgender athletes and push the NCAA into banning them from competition. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to stop trans athletes from competing.",
      "The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the NCAA from allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports in Texas, or in sports that involve Texas programs. Or it wants the court to require the NCAA to stop marketing events as \u201cwomen's\u201d sports if transgender athletes are allowed.",
      "In a statement, Paxton appeared to reference the recent controversy involving San Jose State women's volleyball, where several opponents forfeited matches this season on grounds the Spartans had a transgender player.",
      "A federal court last month refused to block the school from playing in the Mountain West Conference championship.",
      "\u201cWhen people watch a women\u2019s volleyball game, for example, they expect to see women playing against other women, not biological males pretending to be something they are not,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cRadical \u2018gender theory\u2019 has no place in college sports.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press is withholding the player\u2019s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity and through school officials has declined an interview request.",
      "Paxton accused the NCAA of \u201cintentionally and knowingly jeopardizing the safety and wellbeing of women\" and turning women's sports into \u201cco-ed competitions.\u201d",
      "The NCAA does not track data on transgender athletes among the 544,000 currently competing on 19,000 teams at various levels across the country. NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in Congress earlier this month that he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender.",
      "\u201cCollege sports are the premier stage for women\u2019s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women\u2019s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement Monday.",
      "Brooke Slusser, the San Jose State volleyball co-captain who was among the group of players who sued the Mountain West Conference over her teammate's participation, praised the Texas lawsuit on social media.",
      "\u201cHey NCAA, just in case you haven\u2019t realized yet this fight will just keep getting harder for you until you make a change!,\u201d Slusser posted on X.",
      "The NCAA established a policy in 2010 that requires trans athletes who were assigned male at birth to complete at least one year of testosterone suppression therapy before being eligible to compete on a women\u2019s team.",
      "Trans athletes who were assigned female at birth and transitioned to male can compete on a men\u2019s team but if they have received testosterone treatment are ineligible to compete on a women\u2019s team.",
      "The athletes are required to meet their chosen sport\u2019s standard for documented testosterone levels at various points during a season.",
      "In 2022, the NCAA revised the policy in what the organization called an attempt to be aligned with national sports governing bodies. If a governing body does not have a trans athlete policy, then it scales up to the international federation that oversees the sport. If there is no international federation policy, previously established Olympic policy criteria would be followed.",

      "Netflix will have one of its biggest days since the site launched in 1998 when it carries two NFL games for the first time on Christmas",
      "Netflix will have one of its biggest days Wednesday since the site launched in 1998 when it airs two NFL games for the first time.",
      "\u201cNFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix\u201d begins with a two-hour pregame show at 11 a.m., before Pittsburgh hosts Kansas City. Baltimore faces Houston in the second game.",
      "The streaming giant agreed to a three-year contract in May to carry Christmas Day games.",
      "Netflix\u2019s 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries will be able to stream the games, marking the first time one outlet has distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix will have the games available in five languages \u2014 English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German.",
      "The games will also air on CBS affiliates in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Houston. NFL policy dictates that games on cable or being exclusively streamed must also be on an over-the-air station in the competing teams\u2019 markets. It will also be available on mobile devices in the U.S. for those who have NFL+.",
      "The biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL\u2019s moves into streaming \u2014 Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d package moved to YouTube TV last year.",
      "That\u2019s true, but the league wasn\u2019t about to give up Christmas after seeing the ratings. Last year\u2019s three games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The early afternoon contest between the Las Vegas Raiders and Chiefs led the way, averaging 29.48 million.",
      "The Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and Texans played on Saturday, giving them the same turnaround they would have if they played on Sunday and then Thursday.",
      "All four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs.",
      "Kansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed \u2014 which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs \u2014 with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record.",
      "Houston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed.",
      "Netflix hopes so. Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the system was stress tested, and then some, during the Nov. 14 bout, along with internet service providers reporting they were also overwhelmed by the surge that occurred before and during the fight.",
      "The bout peaked at 65 million concurrent streams, including 38 million concurrent streams in the United States. According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to and during the fight.",
      "Possible? Yes. Likely? No.",
      "The largest audience for a streamed-exclusive NFL game was 23 million on Peacock for last season\u2019s AFC wild-card game between the Miami Dolphins and Chiefs.",
      "Nielsen will measure the ratings for the Christmas Day games, with early numbers expected late afternoon on Thursday.",
      "It will probably beat kickoff for both games, but especially around 5:45 p.m. EST. That would be near halftime of the Ravens-Texans game, and when Beyonc\u00e9 will be performing.",
      "Mariah Carey will kick off the day with a taped performance of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You.\u201d",
      "There is no word if Taylor Swift will make the trip to Pittsburgh to watch her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Swift has been spending time in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour two weeks ago.",
      "The NFL will have at least two games on Dec. 25 in 2025 and \u201926, with Netflix slated to have at least one each year. Amazon Prime Video will have a night game with Christmas on a Thursday next year.",
      "Netflix\u2019s worldwide partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment will begin on Jan. 6 when \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d moves to the streaming service.",
      "On Friday, Netflix secured the U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.",

      "Johnson, who was a 29-year-old forward with the Nottingham Panthers, was skating with the puck into Sheffield\u2019s defensive zone. As he pivoted to move inside, Petgrave was skating toward him. Petgrave had another Panthers player in front of him and appears to have made contact. Then, Petgrave\u2019s left skate elevated as the defenseman began to fall and the blade hit Johnson in the neck.",
      "\u201cInitially, I had the benefit of insurance cover, but through no fault of my own, this has been halted,\u201d Petgrave\u2019s statement said. \u201cAdditionally, the time and costs involved in the legal investigation and potential court proceedings are difficult for me to cover on a privately funded basis. This is especially challenging because my UK visa has expired, preventing me from working as a professional ice hockey player while I continue to need legal assistance.\u201d",
      "Johnson was living with fiancee Ryan Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School.",

      "They then went out and made owner Jerry Jones proud, with a 26-24 victory over the playoff-chasing Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "With all the lingering questions about the future of coach Mike McCarthy with him being on an expiring contract, and the Cowboys (7-8) far removed from the possibility of repeating as NFC East champions, they won for the fourth time in their last five games \u2014 all without injured franchise quarterback Dak Prescott.",
      "\u201cProud of those guys. They wouldn\u2019t give it up out there. So I\u2019m real, real proud of them,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd Mike McCarthy, he just won\u2019t let them not think they\u2019re playing for the Super Bowl out there. He won\u2019t let them do it. So proud of that.\u201d",
      "After three consecutive playoff appearances, the Cowboys were out of contention for a postseason berth with three games to play \u2014 the earliest they have knocked out since 2015. That is now two games, next week at the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles (12-3) before the regular-season finale at home against Washington (10-5).",
      "The Commanders' 36-33 victory over Philadelphia earlier Sunday ended all hope for the Dallas.",

Wasn\u2019t much different than a normal game. You\u2019re just wanting to keep your mind in it, too, and stay focused. I thought our guys did a hell of a job.\u201d",

      "With two weeks remaining, three of eight division titles are secured, eight teams have wrapped up playoff berths and 11 more are competing for the six remaining spots.",
      "The biggest change in the standings occurred in the NFC South with Atlanta reclaiming the top spot from Tampa Bay.",
      "Here\u2019s a breakdown by division:",
      "Buffalo Bills: Locked up their fifth straight division crown weeks ago. Buffalo overcame a 14-0 deficit and held on for a 24-21 victory over the woeful Patriots. The Bills (12-3) still have a chance for the AFC\u2019s No. 1 seed, but must win out and need the Chiefs to lose two games. Josh Allen injured his elbow against New England but finished the game.",
      "Miami Dolphins: A 29-17 victory over San Francisco kept Miami in contention for a wild-card spot. The Dolphins (7-8) have to beat the Browns and Jets on the road and get plenty of help.",
      "Pittsburgh Steelers: They\u2019ve dropped two in a row, the last a 34-17 loss to Baltimore on Saturday that prevented the Steelers (10-5) from winning the division. Facing Kansas City on three days\u2019 rest on Christmas Day will be a challenge for an injury-depleted crew. Russell Wilson and the passing game miss injured wide receiver George Pickens. Pittsburgh controls its division hopes, needing wins over the Chiefs and Bengals to take the division.",
      "Baltimore Ravens: Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry delivered a big win over the Steelers and the Ravens (10-5) now can win the division with two victories and one loss by Pittsburgh. Baltimore visits Houston on Christmas Day and finishes at home against Cleveland.",
      "Cincinnati Bengals: Joe Burrow threw three TD passes to take a 39-37 lead over Jackson and the Bengals (7-8) beat the Browns 24-6 to stay in the mix. Cincinnati has to beat the Broncos and Steelers and get a lot of help.",
      "Houston Texans: Already won their second straight division title. The Texans (9-6) are reeling, though, after losing wideout Tank Dell to a significant knee injury in a 27-19 loss to Kansas City on Saturday. Houston will likely get the No. 4 seed.",
      "Indianapolis Colts: Stayed in contention with a 38-30 win over the Titans. The Colts (7-8) should beat the Giants and Jaguars to close out the season but they\u2019ll need a ton of help to get in.",
      "Kansas City Chiefs: Patrick Mahomes and Co. are 14-1, have won their ninth straight division title and they\u2019re going for a Super Bowl three-peat. The Chiefs will secure the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with one more win.",
      "Los Angeles Chargers: Have the inside track for the No. 6 seed following a 34-27 win over Denver on Thursday night that gave them a season sweep. The Chargers (9-6) take a wild-card spot with a victory over either the Patriots or Raiders.",
      "Denver Broncos: They\u2019re one win away from securing their first playoff berth since winning a Super Bowl behind a stout defense and Peyton Manning nine years ago. The Broncos (9-6) visit the Bengals and finish at home vs. Kansas City.",
      "Philadelphia Eagles: Blew a 21-7 lead and lost 36-33 to Washington, a significant blow to their hopes of landing the NFC\u2019s No. 1 seed. Jalen Hurts\u2019 value to the Eagles (12-3) became clear when the offense struggled after he suffered a concussion. Kenny Pickett guided Philadelphia to 26 points but he threw a pick, three straight drives ended with punts and the offense settled for four field goals in the second half. The Eagles will clinch the division with a victory over the Cowboys or Giants and most likely will finish with the No. 2 seed.",
      "Washington Commanders: Jayden Daniels tossed five TD passes against the NFL\u2019s top-ranked defense and the Commanders (10-5) moved closer to a playoff berth. They need to win out and the Eagles to lose twice for a division title.",
      "Detroit Lions: Beat the Bears 34-17 for their franchise-best 13th win. The Lions (13-2) can win the division and secure the No. 1 seed with a victory over San Francisco and if Minnesota loses to Green Bay. Or, the division and the NFC\u2019s top seed could come down to Week 18 when the Vikings visit Detroit.",
      "Minnesota Vikings: Sam Darnold rallied the Vikings to a 27-24 win in Seattle that kept Minnesota (13-2) in the hunt for the No. 1 seed. They have to beat the Packers at home and Lions on the road to get it.",
      "Green Bay Packers: They\u2019ll get a wild-card spot with a victory over New Orleans on Monday night. The Packers (10-4) are 0-4 against the Lions, Eagles and Vikings but get a chance against Minnesota.",
      "Atlanta Falcons: A 34-7 victory over the New York Giants in Michael Penix Jr.\u2019s first career start plus Tampa Bay\u2019s 26-24 loss at Dallas put Atlanta back in first place. The Falcons (8-7) swept the Buccaneers so they hold the tiebreaker. They\u2019ve got a tough game coming up at Washington and close the regular season against the Panthers at home.",
      "Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Lost control of the division with a disappointing loss to the Cowboys. The Buccaneers (8-7) have to beat the Panthers and Saints at home and need the Falcons to lose once. They could make the playoffs as a wild-card team if they win out and the Commanders lose twice.",
      "Los Angeles Rams: A 19-9 over Aaron Rodgers and the Jets coupled with Seattle\u2019s loss to Minnesota gave the Rams an inside track to the division crown. The Rams (9-6) can take the West with a win over the Cardinals and a loss by the Seahawks to the Bears.",
      "Seattle Seahawks: They\u2019ve been eliminated from wild-card contention. The Seahawks (8-7) can only make the playoffs by winning the division. They\u2019ll need the Rams to lose to Arizona and they have to win out. There\u2019s a minuscule chance Seattle could win the division on the fifth tiebreaker if the Rams beat the Cardinals and both teams finish 10-7.",

      "After a poor performance in Miami's 29-17 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Hill was candid about the reason for a puzzling decline in his connection with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa this season.",
      "\u201cI feel like at the end of the day, I need those valuable reps with Tua,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThose vet (veteran) rest days are starting to show.\u201d",
      "It's common for NFL teams to give veteran players days off during the week, especially toward the end of the season when injuries seem to pile up.",
      "Hill has missed three practices over the past month for either rest or personal reasons, including this past Wednesday for what the team called rest/wrist. He has played through a wrist injury all season and was questionable entering Sunday's game.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always pros and cons with any sort of rest,\" coach Mike McDaniel said. \"Shoot, I want every player to play 100% of the practice snaps at full tilt every week. You have an imperfect formula of trying to figure out how to rest guys and what does best for their body.",
      "\"I think the adjustment to getting more reps with Tua, that\u2019s an easy one. You know what I\u2019ll do? I\u2019ll say, hey, get more reps, and then they\u2019ll do it. But it\u2019s the communication aspect, and you hate for guys to feel like they\u2019re not properly tooled in any sort of situation. So you just adjust off that and make sure we get better from it, not worse.\u201d",
      "Hill caught just 3 of 7 targets for 29 yards and a touchdown and had several drops, including one on third down that went through his hands on Miami's opening drive.",
      "\u201cI completely blame myself for not getting my head around and not seeing the ball,\u201d Hill said, \u201cbecause if I see a ball, we\u2019re talking cross-court, 70-yard touchdown.\"",
      "Tagovailoa and Hill also couldn't connect on two potential touchdowns. The first was tipped by a San Francisco defensive back just outside of Hill's grasp, the other was a drop that Hill again attributed to a lack of reps.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned from Coach (Andy) Reid whenever I was in Kansas City,\u201d Hill said, \u201cI was blessed to be able to play under such a great head coach, is you can\u2019t just show up on Sunday. You\u2019ve got to be able to prepare yourself Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, even Saturday. Then when it\u2019s Sunday, it\u2019s easy.\"",
      "Hill is on pace for his least-productive season since 2019 with Kansas City, when he had 58 receptions, 860 yards and seven touchdowns.",
      "He currently has a team-high 834 yards receiving, six touchdowns and 70 catches \u2014 six receptions fewer than running back De'Von Achane and tight end Jonnu Smith, who lead the team. Hill also entered Sunday averaging just 57.5 yards per game, his fewest since averaging 37.1 yards his rookie season.",
      "That's a stark decline from last year, when Hill had 1,799 yards, 13 receiving touchdowns and 112.4 yards per game, which all led the NFL.",
      "Hill didn't have Tagovailoa throwing him the ball for four games earlier this season, when the quarterback went on injured reserve with a concussion. Hill saw a huge drop in his production during that span, with just 35 yards per game as the Dolphins averaged a league-worst 12 points.",
      "Tagovailoa agreed after Sunday's game that he and Hill need more reps together.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the secret sauce to me being able to connect with all these guys,\u201d Tagovailoa said. \u201cYou guys see Jonnu (Smith) here, that\u2019s the secret sauce. If we miss a throw, if we\u2019re off on a throw in the team practice we\u2019ll get together in whatever time we have ... and we\u2019ll get those reps made up. Telling him what I see and then him also telling me how he feels with running it. That has a lot to do with reps for sure.\u201d",

      "With Caruso and Lu Dort creating havoc against opposing backcourts, the Thunder have a Western Conference-best 22-5 record. Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating, opponent field goal percentage, opponent 3-point percentage, opponent points per game, turnovers forced, steals and deflections.",
      "Caruso established himself as an elite perimeter defender in four years with the Los Angeles Lakers and three years with the Chicago Bulls before joining the Thunder. He was on the all-defense first team in 2023 and the second team in 2024.",

      "Jessie Bates and Matthew Judon each had a pick-6 to carry Atlanta (8-7) to its second straight win after a four-game losing streak put its postseason hopes in jeopardy. The Falcons came into the week a game behind Tampa Bay in the NFC South and holding the tiebreaker edge over the Buccaneers, who were playing Sunday night at Dallas.",
      "Penix, the No. 8 overall pick in this year's draft, got his first NFL start against the Giants (2-13) after the Falcons decided to bench turnover-prone Kirk Cousins, just nine months after signing him to a four-year, $180 million contract that included $100 million in guaranteed money.",
      "The left-handed rookie was not overwhelmed by the moment, completing 18 of 27 passes for 202 yards \u2014 numbers that would've been better if not for at least three dropped passes, one of which Kyle Pitts bobbled right into the hands of a New York defender for Penix's lone interception.",
      "The defense made things even easier for the new starter, throttling a New York team that struggled to put anything together with Drew Lock returning as the starting QB after missing the previous week with a heel injury.",
      "With the Giants up 7-3 in the second quarter, Lock's pass for Wan'Dale Robinson was easily swiped by Bates, who ran untouched the other way for a 55-yard touchdown return that put the Falcons ahead to stay.",
      "Judon put the game away on the second play of the second half, grabbing a ball that was batted in the air by Zach Harrison as Lock attempted to throw. The edge rusher took it 27 yards for another pick-6 that gave Atlanta a commanding 24-7 lead.",
      "It was only the second time in franchise history that Atlanta has returned a pair of interceptions to the end zone. Kenny Johnson did it by himself in a 47-41 victory over Green Bay on Nov. 27, 1983.",
      "Lock, on the other hand, became the first Giants quarterback since Eli Manning in 2007 to toss multiple pick-6s in a game.",
      "Bijan Robinson had touchdowns runs of 2 and 4 yards for the Falcons. He finished with 94 yards on 22 carries and now has 10 rushing TDs on the season, becoming the first Atlanta back to reach double figures since Devonta Freeman during the 2016 Super Bowl season.",
      "Lock opened the scoring with a 2-yard TD pass to Tyrone Tracy, who made a dazzling one-handed catch while tiptoeing along the end line. But that was about the only highlight for the Giants, who are wrapping up one of the most dismal seasons in their storied history.",
      "Riley Patterson, taking over as Atlanta's kicker after struggling Younghoe Koo went on injured reserve, made field goals of 52 and 37 yards after missing his first attempt from 43 yards.",
      "Giants: ILB Micah McFadden (neck) and S Jason Pinnock (eye) both left the game. ... Tommy DeVito was cleared from concussion protocol and served as Lock's backup.",
      "Falcons: CB Antonio Hamilton (quad) was injured in the first half and didn't return. ... WR Drake London (hamstring) hobbled off in the second half.",
      "Giants: Host the Indianapolis Colts next Sunday before closing the season at Philadelphia on Jan. 5. If New York loses its last two games, it will mark the fewest wins in a season since a 2-12 mark in 1974.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio State players had been thinking about a rematch with Oregon long before the Buckeyes crushed Tennessee in a first-round playoff game.",
      "Their first chance to avenge the Oct. 12 loss to the Ducks looked to be the Big Ten championship game, but that slipped away when the Buckeyes lost to Michigan and gave up their spot in the title game.",
      "Now, by virtue of Saturday night's 42-17 win over Tennessee, the Buckeyes will see the Ducks again in a quarterfinal game on a grand stage \u2014 the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be a heck of an opportunity for all of us,\u201d Ohio State quarterback Will Howard said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all been looking forward to this one, another crack at these guys. The way the last one ended didn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d",
      "In the first game, the Buckeyes led twice in the second half but couldn't hold it. They were driving in the final minute. After a questionable interference penalty on freshman receiver Jeremiah Smith, Howard scrambled out of the pocket to extend a play and slid as time ran out, ending the 32-31 shootout on a mental error.",
      "It would be the closest game of the season for top-seeded Oregon (13-0).",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the opportunity because it was not a great game for us,\u201d Ohio State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said. \"And I know, quite frankly, the guys got a little pissed off. They used that game as motivation. So, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking forward to another opportunity.\u201d",
      "The Ohio State defense \u2014 now statistically the best in the nation \u2014 allowed Heisman Trophy finalist Dillon Gabriel and the Ducks to pile up 496 yards.",
      "\u201cYou get to watch yourself play, and watch the mistakes that you\u2019ve made, and you see how they attack you,\u201d Ohio State linebacker Cody Simon said. \u201cBut also, there\u2019s a lot of football played in between that. They\u2019ve changed. We\u2019ve changed, and we\u2019re just, we\u2019re going to look at what we need to do, and trust the game plan the coaches have, and we\u2019ll go and tackle them.\u201d",
      "Nearly everything was working right inside the frigid Horseshow on Saturday night, the first December college football game in the history of the 102-year-old stadium.",
      "Howard threw two touchdown passes to Smith and compiled 311 passing yards \u2014 his highest total since the Oregon game. TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins rushed for two touchdowns apiece. The defense sacked Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava four times and limited him to 104 passing yards, his lowest total of the season.",
      "Oregon coach Dan Lanning recognized the Buckeyes' ability to be explosive.",
      "\u201cThat's an elite football that we just played,\u201d Lanning said after the October game. \u201cThey\u2019re really, really talented. They don't have weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Other quarterfinal games include No. 6 seed Penn State against third-seeded Boise State on Dec. 31, and on Jan. 1 it will be No. 5 Texas against No. 4 Arizona State, and No. 7 Notre Dame versus No. 2 Georgia.",

      "Skattebo put on a show the last time the Sun Devils were on the field. He scored three touchdowns, had 170 yards rushing and 208 all-purpose yards in Arizona State's 45-19 win over Iowa State in the Big 12 championship game.",
      "Skattebo bounced off tacklers, ran through others and outraced some more. He struck the Heisman Trophy pose a few times, then had a few things to say about it all afterward.",
      "\u201cNobody respects the fact that I\u2019m the best running back in the country. And I\u2019m going to stand on that,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep proving people wrong. And whatever NFL team takes me is going to get a gem.\u201d",
      "Skattebo brings some gaudy numbers to Atlanta to back it up.",
      "The AP All-American's 19 rushing touchdowns and 22 overall are both tied for school records. He needs 75 yards to break the program's single-season rushing record of 1,642.",

      "Clemson had a chance Saturday to get within a touchdown in the final 8 minutes. A touchdown could have completely swung momentum their way.",
      "But after reaching the Texas 1, two straight runs failed to reach the goal line. Sorrell was in on the tackle that stopped Clemson's Keith Adams Jr. just short of a touchdown on fourth down.",
      "\u201cWe take pride in not letting guys score or get in our paint,\u201d Texas safety Andrew Mukuba said.",

      "Average final score: Winners 36, Losers 17.",
      "In four games, not a single one was closer than a 10-point margin, and even that one felt worse.",
      "This bold, new experiment was supposed to bring more programs from more parts of the country into the loop of a largely regional sport that had been dominated by about a half-dozen teams for the last decade.",
      "Instead, it will take another 10 days to find out if \u201cmore\u201d really means more \u2014 or if more just means a few weeks of what we just saw before arriving at what we had before \u2014 a group of four contenders battling it out for a title that only they had any realistic chance to win.",
      "One part that did feel like a success was that the stands were full in all four stadiums \u2014 at Texas, Notre Dame, Penn State and Ohio State.",
      "\u201cI think college football got this one right,\u201d Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said after the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 in front of a packed house in what turned out to be the weekend's most compelling game. \u201cAs much as we critique some of the things that are happening in our game right now, this idea of a home playoff game with this 12-team format, this was pretty special.\u201d",
      "The TV ratings will paint a fuller picture, especially of the decision to run directly against two NFL games, both of which came down to the fourth quarter.",
      "The quarterfinals come over the New Year's holiday, where we'll get more clarity not only about who might win the title, but whether the CFP as it is structured is as good as it can be. The matchups (and issues involved in all of them):",
      "Fiesta Bowl, Dec. 31, No. 6 Penn State vs. No. 3 Boise State: The rules called for the four highest-ranked conference champions to receive first-round byes, and so you get this. Penn State is the worse seed but is a 10 1/2-point favorite over the Mountain West Conference champions. Boise State has the nation's leading rusher in Ashton Jeanty. Penn State is probably bigger and faster at every other position.",
      "Peach Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 5 Texas vs. No. 4 Arizona State: See above for thoughts about byes, potential mismatches and pairings that might have made more sense had they come earlier. Texas is a 13 1/2-point favorite. But, the Sun Devils of the Big 12 are the closest thing this tournament has to a Cinderella \u2014 in win-or-you're-done territory since Nov. 2, and with a pair of eminently entertaining players in quarterback Sam Leavitt and running back Cam Skattebo.",
      "Rose Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 8 Ohio State vs. No. 1 Oregon: Had the rule-makers chosen to reseed the bracket after the first round to give Oregon a game against the highest-seeded team left, this would have been the matchup anyway. But do we really want a rematch of possibly the best game in college football this season \u2014 Oregon's 32-31 win over Ohio State in October \u2014 in the quarterfinals?",
      "Sugar Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 7 Notre Dame at No. 2 Georgia: Reports are that Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck might be done for the season after hurting his elbow in the SEC title game. The selection committee was supposed to consider injuries in its rankings, but probably didn't have enough information to make an informed decision at the time. Long ago, in a galaxy far away, Georgia beat Notre Dame in the 1981 Sugar Bowl to capture its second national title.",
      "The transfer portal will (thankfully?) close Dec. 28, meaning the steady trickle of departures from teams with title hopes will not infiltrate the headlines as we head into football's elite eight.",
      "But this entire setup is awkward. Arizona State lost 12 players to the portal after it opened on Dec. 9. Tennessee lost 11. The highest-profile departure was Penn State backup quarterback Beau Pribula. Whether these players would've been on the field much (they wouldn't, which is probably why some left) almost seems beside the point.",
      "For decades, playing to win a championship was thought to be the north star for any elite athlete. Or so we thought. There is a lot of money available, and it's also not hard to blame a player for trying to max out his earning potential in the new world of college football endorsements.",
      "\u201cI think everybody that follows the sport understands that it\u2019s a unique time of year,\u201d Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said. \u201cI\u2019m not in charge of that. Do I think they need to find a way to go through all the processes that they have right now, or things that are in the game but find a better calendar for it? Yeah, I think that would be best for the game for sure.\u201d",
      "There are another 28 bowl games remaining that will have no implication on the national title. Maybe the best one is Dec. 28 when Heisman winner Travis Hunter and Colorado face BYU in the Alamo Bowl.",
      "There's nothing particularly big on the line here, but there is a message being sent.",
      "Colorado has two first-round draft picks on the roster in Hunter and the coach's son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Normally, they wouldn't find themselves anywhere near this game, for fear an injury could derail their pro prospects.",

      "ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 Lindsey Vonn lost a chance to improve her ranking when the second race of her World Cup skiing comeback at age 40 was canceled on Sunday due to strong winds and poor visibility.",
      "On Saturday, Vonn placed 14th in a super-G on the Corviglia course in St. Moritz to mark her return to the circuit after nearly six years of retirement.",
      "Vonn lost time at the start of the race but then was competitive with the top-five finishers the rest of the way down.",
      "\u201cIt took her 20 seconds to get back into it, and then she was fine,\u201d said Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019d like to be in the top 15 later in the season,\u201d Knight told The Associated Press when the race was canceled. \u201cWhat we\u2019re aiming for the next races is to accumulate points and get a better start number around the girls who are competitive.\u201d",
      "Since Vonn hadn\u2019t raced in so long, she had to use a new wild card for former champions that enabled her to start No. 31. But that\u2019s still long after the top-ranked skiers start, leaving her with a bumpier and more challenging course.",
      "\u201cIf we can get around those other girls on the same track in the same conditions then you really know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Knight said.",
      "Vonn now won\u2019t race again until the next speed weekend in St. Anton, Austria on Jan. 11-12, which features a downhill and a super-G.",
      "After St. Anton, she plans to compete in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, and hopefully qualify for the world championships in Saalbach, Austria, in February.",
      "For now, Vonn is heading home to Miami for the holidays. Then she will return to Europe for training in early January before resuming a near-full schedule of speed races.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have couple of races later on before finals on the schedule. But we\u2019ll see,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just moved so quickly.\u201d",

      "Nebraska's third-largest high school decided not to play varsity girls basketball this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Plunging participation in girls basketball led one of Nebraska's largest high schools to cancel its varsity team for the year.",
      "The decision by Grand Island Senior High School \u2014 the state's third-largest with more than 2,600 students \u2014 reflects a national decline in participation in the girls sport, even as the popularity of women's basketball behind the likes of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has sent record numbers of fans flocking to arenas or tuning in on TV.",
      "Schools across the country have made similar choices, but that hasn\u2019t made the move any easier for those passionate about Grand Island basketball.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the train coming. I mean we\u2019ve been sitting on the tracks forever. But frankly, people just didn\u2019t want to do the heavy lifting that was required,\u201d said Jeremy Jensen, a former Grand Island mayor and high school soccer coach who wishes more had been done to build a sustainable girls basketball program.",
      "The high school in the largely blue-collar city of 52,000 about 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Omaha decided to cancel its varsity and junior varsity teams this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport.",
      "The team suffered a series of lopsided losses, and with many young athletes choosing to specialize in one sport and other activities competing for girls' time, the school decided to focus on developing young players instead of putting a team of freshman and sophomores on the court.",
      "Still, the school's decision was jarring at a time when college and professional women's basketball has been surging in popularity, partly due to the phenomenal success of WNBA Indiana Fever guard Clark, who set records at the University of Iowa.",
      "Kansas State University women\u2019s basketball coach Jeff Mittie said more viewers doesn't necessarily mean more players.",
      "\u201cCertainly in college, all of our games are on TV, easy for people to find, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re playing the sport,\u201d Mittie said. \"It just means they\u2019re interested in watching it.\u201d",
      "Since Clark was born 22 years ago, participation in girls high school basketball has dropped nearly 20% and the sport has fallen from most popular to number four behind volleyball, soccer and track and field, which all have seen double-digit surges in participation, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "Even as the basketball numbers have dropped, total participation in high school sports has grown, with more than 3.4 million girls competing in high school sports last year.",
      "In the past few years in Grand Island, Jim Ward watched every player on his oldest daughter's middle school team quit basketball in high school, either to focus on another sport like volleyball or wrestling or because they lost interest. During that time, the high school girls team was losing games by margins of 70 points or more.",
      "The team lost 43 of its last 44 varsity games and has not won more than three games in a season since 2016-17, with its last winning season in 2009-10.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Grand Island going into Omaha facing some kids that are going to go D-1 (Division I) and you can only keep up with them for the first half of the first quarter, would you want to play longer?\u201d asked Ward, who serves on the booster club board and has a daughter on the team in 10th grade.",
      "Kelli Jefferies knows success is possible in Grand Island because she led the school to its only state championship in 1979 as a player and racked up 231 victories over 33 years as coach before stepping down in 2012.",
      "But Jefferies said she understands the current struggles.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not really able to compete and be competitive, you can see why kids don\u2019t want to do it anymore,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cThat\u2019s not fun for everyone, for coaches and players and anyone involved.\"",
      "The problems in Grand Island and elsewhere run much deeper than a losing record.",
      "In some communities it can be hard for girls to find opportunities to compete and learn the game when they are young. Many families can't afford to invest the thousands of dollars and countless hours required to play club basketball to prepare them to compete in high school, putting them behind in development.",
      "As teams get competitive earlier and earlier, girls might quit the sport if they are cut in grade school.",
      "Families in Grand Island who want their kids to compete at the highest levels of club sports must drive about two hours twice a week to Lincoln or Omaha for practices and again on the weekends for tournaments if they are not traveling farther to other cities.",
      "Grand Island\u2019s current coach, Kathryn Langrehr, works with middle schoolers and offers free basketball clinics at all the city\u2019s elementary schools to help build a pipeline of players for the sport.",
      "But rebuilding could be challenging, especially given the pressure on kids to specialize in just one sport.",
      "\u201cIt kind of speaks to the world that we\u2019re living in with club sports and specialization of sports, where kids want to participate or are only able to participate in one activity,\" said Jon Dolliver, who oversees basketball at the Nebraska School Activities Association.",
      "Volleyball in particular grew tremendously as the sport became much more visible on television and social media and the U.S. emerged as a world power.",
      "The sport is especially popular in Nebraska, where Creighton University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the state system's flagship campus, are ranked in the collegiate top 10. Nebraska fell short in the national semifinals on Friday. Last year, 92,003 people filled Nebraska's football stadium to watch a volleyball match, setting a world record for attendance at a women's sporting event.",
      "Brandon Traudt's daughter was a strong basketball player in middle school after growing up alongside her brother Isaac, who now plays for Creighton, but she always preferred volleyball. She will soon pursue that passion at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI think girls just naturally \u2014 especially in the state of Nebraska \u2014 gravitate towards volleyball,\u201d Traudt said. \u201cVolleyball is just very, very good in this state.\u201d",
      "Maybe the popularity of the WNBA and players like Clark could change the trends, but Ward, the Grand Island dad, can envision an 8-year-old telling her parents she wants to play basketball only to be told there is no time for that with volleyball and dance.",
      "\u201cI think the Caitlin Clark thing \u2014 it\u2019s tough to say if this third grader sees it that she\u2019s just going to quit volleyball and start playing basketball now. I don\u2019t know,\" Ward said."

      "Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company.",
      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",

      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",

      "Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.",
      "Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.",
      "Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.",
      "His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.",
      "Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.",
      "\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d",
      "Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.",
      "He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.",
      "He later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.",
      "His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d",
      "He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.",
      "But of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d",
      "He had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.",
      "Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.",
      "Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.",

      "The lawsuits target the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires California to reduce the environmental impact of transportation fuels by incentivizing producers to cut emissions. The California Air Resources Board voted last month to increase the state\u2019s emission reduction targets, fund charging infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, and phase out incentives for capturing methane emissions from dairy farms to turn into fuel.",

      "The company says it doesn't expect the strike to impact holiday shipments.",
      "Amazon has a couple hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters mainly have focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors that handle package deliveries for the company.

    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "That authority is vital, homeland security officials and experts say, to detect and disable any threatening drones flying near military bases, the president's location, U.S. borders, prisons and mass gatherings such as New Year's Eve celebrations and the Super Bowl \u2014 and they were hopeful a reauthorization of those powers will be approved before Friday's expiration.",
      "But the temporary spending bill including the reauthorization fell into question Wednesday when President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected it and told Republicans to essentially renegotiate only days before the deadline when federal funding runs out. Congress continued working Thursday to pass a bill to avert a shutdown.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what a lapse in that authority would mean, including to drone detection systems the federal government has deployed to states, including New Jersey where numerous sightings have been reported, at the request of local officials. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office referred questions about the detection systems to Homeland Security officials.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday declined to comment on the expiration of the drone authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, along with other Biden administration officials and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, has repeatedly called for the reauthorization and expansion of the authority for \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d operations, or C-UAS.",
      "\u201cEnsuring that existing authorities do not lapse is vital to our mission, including protecting the president and vice president, patrolling certain designated areas along the Southwest Border, securing certain federal facilities and assets, and safeguarding the public,\u201d Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee in November 2023. \u201cAny lapse in DHS\u2019s current C-UAS authority would entail serious risks for our homeland security, as DHS would have to cease or curtail existing C-UAS operations.\"",
      "Bills in the House and Senate that would extend and expand the federal government's drone powers remain pending. The bills also would allow state and local officials for the first time to track and disable threatening drones under a pilot program overseen by federal authorities.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, was blocked from quickly advancing the Senate bill when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, objected to its passage. Paul said it wasn\u2019t clear there is a threat from drones that warrants urgent action."

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:46:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership.",
      "\"Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,\" Less added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles.",
      "Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business.",

      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",

      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",

Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",

      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money with Elon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.\u201d",
      "Musk doesn\u2019t appear to give Trump much boost with people who don\u2019t back the incoming president.",
      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",
      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",

      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",

      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:11:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last month tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",
      "\"After Plaintiff's resignation from Congress, Defendants improperly continued to act on its investigation, and apparently voted to publicly release reports and/or investigative materials related to Plaintiff without proper notice or disclosure to Plaintiff,\" the complaint said.",
      "Following the report's release Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta gave Gaetz until 5 p.m. ET to show why the suit shouldn't be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, given \"this case appears to be moot in light of the House Ethics Committee's public disclosure of the report.\"",
      "In a subsequent filing, attorneys for Gaetz acknowledged that their lawsuit is now \"mooted\" following the release of the report -- a move they said has caused Gaetz \"irreversible and irreparable harm.\"",
      "The filing said the committee's decision to release the report was \"unprecedented and procedurally defective,\" and reiterated their claim that it was released without notifying him.",

      "The same recording identified the presence of a third injured party and mentioned the potential need for an air ambulance at the scene.",
      "While the cause of the incident has yet to be determined, the weather system that had been slamming the West Coast over the weekend was responsible for generating powerful winds across parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where a weather monitoring station located at the highest point of Heavenly Mountain Ski Resort reported a gust of 78 mph on Sunday, one day before the chairlift incident occurred.",

    "summary": "The move reduces the sentence for all but three of the 40 inmates on federal death row.",
    "story": [
      "The move reduces sentences for all but three of 40 inmates on federal death row.",
      "President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of 37 inmates on federal death row, the White House said Monday.",
      "The move reduces the sentence for all but three of the 40 inmates on federal death row. Biden said that the commutations are \"consistent with the moratorium my Administration has imposed on federal executions,\" with the exception of terrorism and hate-motivated mass killings.",
      "The three people on the federal execution list who were not on Biden's commutation list are Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing; Robert Bowers, who was convicted of the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue antisemitic attack; and Dylann Roof, who killed nine Black churchgoers in a racially motivated shooting in South Carolina.",
      "According to the White House fact sheet about the move, the recipients of the commutations will have their sentences \"reclassified from execution to life without the possibility of parole.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,\" Biden wrote in a statement about the commutations.",
      "\"But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level,\" Biden added.",
      "The White House fact sheet said that the move was an effort to prevent President-elect Donald Trump from \"carrying out the execution sentences that would not be handed down under current policy and practice.\"",
      "Trump has not only advocated for executions to continue but has called for an expansion on what crimes should warrant capital punishment, for example, people who kill law enforcement officers or those convicted of drug or human trafficking.",
      "Trump spokesman Steven Cheung, who will serve as White House communications director in the incoming administration, said Biden's action is \"a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones\" that President Biden granted clemency to most of the federal inmates facing death sentences.",
      "\"These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,\" Cheung said in a statement on Monday. \"President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people.\"",
      "Biden's decision comes after some notable figures and many activists called for Biden to take action. Pope Francis has called for the sentences of Americans on death row to be commuted during his Angelus address in October, the Vatican News Source reported.",
      "\"Today, I feel compelled to ask all of you to pray for the inmates on death row in the United States,\" the Pope said at the time, according to the report. \"Let us pray that their sentences may be commuted or changed. Let us think of these brothers and sisters of ours and ask the Lord for the grace to save them from death.\"",
      "Biden is a devout Catholic and is set next month to visit the Holy See during a trip to Italy, where he will also have an audience with the pope.",
      "Activists have called for Biden to commute the sentence of many or all federal death row inmates for some time. More than 130 civil and human rights groups penned a letter to the president in early December calling on him to commute the sentences of \"all individuals on federal death row.\"",
      "\"The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now. Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,\" the letter said.",
      "It is also an issue of racial justice. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 38% of federal death row inmates are Black -- compared to the 14% of total American population according to the Pew Research Center. About 56% of the 40 men on federal death row were men of color, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "On CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, a close confidant of Biden, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said that he had urged the president to take action, citing the unfairness in the justice system.",

    "story": [
      "Trump celebrates election results and looks ahead to delivering on promises.",
      "In his first rally-style speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump raved about his election victory for nearly 10 minutes before transitioning to confidence that he would deliver on his administration's promises, as well as touting his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump spoke at AmericaFest, a political festival for conservatives put on by Turning Point, the conservative organization run by Charlie Kirk that was instrumental in helping Trump garner support among younger voters through its get out the vote initiatives in battleground states.",
      "Trump's speech was essentially many of the proposals he has already released on his Truth Social social media platform, including his threats on tariffs and taking back the Panama Canal, as well as bragging about the amount of people that have reached out to him since his victory.",
      "He said his remarks were \u201cjust a small preview of the common sense revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause that's what I call it, a common sense revolution that's coming soon to America, to a theater near you, right? But it's coming to you through your president, Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Throughout his 75-minute remarks, Trump made no mention of the recently passed government funding bill, which did not include his last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling or eliminate it. After vocally opposing the original bill, Trump has yet to make any comments on the legislation that passed early Saturday.",
      "However, speakers ahead of Trump had something to say on the issue. Trump's allies called for Speaker Mike Johnson to lose his speakership role over working with Democrats, called for the Republican lawmakers who voted against the package to be primaried, along with threats to Republican senators who were on the fence about confirming some of Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "\"Johnson's not up to the task. He's got to go, right? He's got to go. Should Johnson be speaker of the House?\" Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who served time in jail for contempt of Congress, asked the crowd, which responded with a resounding \"No.\"",
      "\"We don't need partisanship now. We need hyperpartisanship now. The conversation is over. We have nothing else to discuss. It's only about the execution of President Trump's plan,\" he added.",
      "However, when Trump took the stage, he spent most of his time touting his transition efforts.",
      "\"We have accomplished so much in just 47 days since the election. But that's only the beginning of what we will achieve together as the 47th president of the United States of America,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump said his second administration would \"turn the page\" on what he called four failed years under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I campaigned on an agenda of delivering profound change to Washington, and last month, the American people voted for change like they've never voted before, and in overwhelming numbers, numbers that nobody saw coming. I saw them coming because I think we all saw coming,\" Trump said.",
      "As tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has become more vocal about the future of the country, including a series of tweets criticizing the government funding bill, many lawmakers and pundits have started quipping that Musk is actually running the country. Trump laughed about the idea on Sunday, calling it the new \"hoax\" from the media and saying he likes to have smart people around him.",
      "\"And no, he's not taking the presidency. I love having smart people\u2026No, no, that's that happening. But Elon's done an amazing job. Isn't it nice to have smart people that we could rely on?\" Trump quipped, celebrating Musk's role with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Trump applauded Musk for his campaign contributions in Pennsylvania, helping North Carolinians during hurricane relief by providing Starlink, and his endeavors with SpaceX.",
      "\"No he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump repeated. \"I'm safe. You know why? He wasn't born in this country. Ha, Ha.\"",
      "Trump spent time praising several of his embattled Cabinet picks, including his defense secretary selection Pete Hegseth, saying he thinks he will do \"great\" in the role.",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, I've nominated an all star Cabinet of some of the most determined and brilliant individuals ever to step forward for public office, and we're getting great reviews I have to say, they're all doing well, but we're getting fantastic reviews on the people that we chose,\" Trump said.",
      "He again shared misinformation about vaccines being linked to a rise in autism and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would be in charge of investigating it.",
      "\"Think of this, 25 years ago, autism, one in 10,000 children today is one in 36 children. Is something wrong? I think so,\" he said. \"And Robert and I and all, we're going to figure it out\u2026\"",
      "Trump provided a one-sentence remark on Tulsi Gabbard, his choice for director of national intelligence, mentioning her nomination without any additional commentary. He added that he thinks Kash Patel, his selection to lead the FBI, \"may be the greatest director of them all.\"",
      "While Trump was going through his Day 1 priorities, he highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments in which he said he is ready to speak with the president-elect.",
      "\"President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible. So we have to wait for this. But we have to end that war. That war is a horrible...\" Trump said, appearing to allude to public comments Putin made on Thursday.",
      "Trump also reiterated his tariff threat against Canada, Mexico, and China if they don't \"step up and stop the illegal aliens and illegal drugs from pouring into our country.\"",
      "\"They can't treat us that way. They're not going to be treating us that way for long that, I can tell you, because we're not going to let them turn the United States into a dumping ground.\"",
      "Trump also doubled down on his threat to take back the Panama Canal, complaining about the fees being charged to the U.S. Navy and American businesses: \"This complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop. It's going to stop,\" he said.",
      "As Trump spent the last couple months of his campaign emphasizing anti-transgender rhetoric, he said he will sign executive orders on Day 1 to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender people out of the military, and keep \"men out of women's sports.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. Later, Trump railed against the \"woke,\" calling wokeness \"bull----.\"",
      "While emphasizing his tariff threat, Trump also once again talked about migrants by labeling them as violent criminals, going on to assert that he would designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, which he attempted to implement during his first term but halted after Mexico's president at the time urged him not to.",
      "\"Every foreign gang member will be expelled, and I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to do it immediately. And we'll unleash the full power of federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Trump also vowed that his immigration policies would include a robust campaign on the flow of fentanyl into America and its devastating effects.",
      "\u201cWe're going to show what these drugs are doing to you. Nobody's done that before, and we're going to do it.\u201d",
      "One of his Day 1 priorities, he said, will be a \"historic slate of executive orders to close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country.\"",
      "\"And on that same day, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight Eisenhower,\" he said, calling it \"Operation Aurora,\" after the Colorado city that he referred to often on the campaign trail where he said immigrant gangs had taken over apartment buildings.",
      "While touting his victory, Trump also expressed gratitude to Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA executive director, who led some of the largest pro-Trump ground efforts among younger voters.",
      "\"I want to express my tremendous gratitude to Charlie Kirk. He's really an amazing guy, amazing guy and his whole staff for their relentless efforts to achieve this very historic victory\u2026 It's not my victory, it's your victory. It's a great honor.\"",
      "Trump continued his victory lap, going on to praise the demographic shifts that happened towards Republicans while promising to unite the country. He also went on a tangent about the reach he was able to have through TikTok.",
      "\"Tiktok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,\" he said. \"They brought me a they brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see. And as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we got to keep this sucker around a little while.'\"",

      "\"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\" Fetterman told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"So country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"",
      "Fetterman, who has made headlines as one of the few in his party who have met with several of Trump's cabinet picks, said his Democratic colleagues need to \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump's 2024 reelection could define Biden's legacy.",
      "Welcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.",
      "nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): 'Tis the season for your favorite media outlets to publish \"year in review\" articles \u2014 the year's best movies, recipes, reality TV moments, etc. But we at 538 are thinking bigger. Instead of \"year in review,\" how about \"presidency in review\"?",
      "On Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 28 days from today \u2014 President Joe Biden will leave office after just one term. That got us thinking ... What have been the biggest news stories of the last four years? What will Biden's presidency be remembered for, and will those memories be good or bad ones? So for the final 538 Slack chat of 2024, I've assembled an all-star panel of reporters and political scientists to discuss what Biden's legacy will be.",
      "Now, I want to acknowledge up front that this is a premature exercise: Ideally, you need distance \u2014 and a knowledge of how things played out after they left office \u2014 to properly assess a presidency, and historians are constantly reevaluating their perceptions of even long-dead presidents based on evolving sensibilities.",
      "But it's often said that journalism is the first draft of history, and someone needs to write that first draft! So, based on what we know today, if you guys had to pick one moment/episode/trend/accomplishment/failure from Biden's presidency that will go down in history, what would it be? Let's start with you, Geoffrey.",
      "geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, senior elections analyst): \"We finally beat Medicare.\" Thus began the end of Biden's reelection campaign in his infamously bad debate against President-elect Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. And because Trump went on to win this election, Biden's choice to seek reelection will undoubtedly be a chief focus of his presidency, even though we'll have to wait to see how other aspects of his presidency will be remembered.",
      "Biden decided to run again despite concerns about his age, and then his debate showing substantially reinforced the doubts many voters already had. Biden stepped aside for Vice President Kamala Harris in late July, becoming the first presumptive presidential nominee in the modern primary era to drop a reelection bid. This left his vice president about three months to campaign for the office, a race she narrowly lost.",
      "We don't know how Trump's second term will go, but considering how impactful it could be, it's hard not to focus on how Biden's choice to run again may have played into Trump's victory. It's difficult to say how things might've played out differently, of course \u2014 counterfactuals always are. But had Biden decided to bow out way back in late 2022, perhaps a different candidate who won a contested Democratic presidential primary would have defeated Trump.",
      "Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): I agree, Geoffrey, and I thought you'd choose the debate. I do think it will be remembered as a turning point, and for causing an extremely rare event in the modern era: a nominee leaving the presidential race so late in the cycle and essentially anointing his vice president without a primary.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, we're elections people, so we might be biased. But I think the unprecedented and dramatic nature of Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election pretty much guarantees it will at least be mentioned in the history books.",
      "julia_azari (Julia Azari, professor of political science at Marquette University and 538 contributor): Sorry, got distracted by the end-of-year recipes.",
      "This definitely makes sense to me, but I also think that as we get further from the 2024 election, this may fade from memory. People don't exactly remember former President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to drop out of the 1968 election as his main legacy, for example, but they do remember the broader circumstances: domestic unrest and the Vietnam War. It's hard to think of an example of an election that became a president's main legacy.",
      "nrakich: That's an interesting point, Julia. I feel like Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 campaign is something that history will never forget ... but, to your point, I'm not sure it's really legacy-defining.",
      "What would be the equivalent of those broader circumstances for Biden? His age? I could see a big part of his legacy being a cautionary tale for Americans to elect anyone older than, say, 75.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Unless he's running against someone about the same age, of course.",
      "julia_azari: Right \u2014 Trump is only a few years younger than Biden.",
      "nrakich: Well, but it could give primary voters pause about supporting someone that old in the future.",
      "Monica Potts: I do think it really solidified for voters and people active in the parties to shift to younger politicians.",
      "In addition to the debate, I was also going to choose Biden's decision to run again. I don't know if there was an exact moment when that happened. He'd been hinting at a reelection campaign for months before officially announcing his bid in April 2023. At the time, he pitched his candidacy as an attempt to hold democracy together and argued that Trump was an existential threat to the country. But many voters had buried the chaos of Trump's first term, the COVID-19 pandemic and the events of Jan. 6 deep in their memory vaults. They were much more concerned with what had happened during Biden's term: record-breaking inflation and the fact that he was rapidly aging in front of them.",
      "It really makes one wonder about all of the Democratic leaders who had epiphanies about Biden's age after the debate and put pressure on him to leave the race. Why didn't they have those earlier in the cycle? He'd been running for reelection for more than a year at that point. There had been plenty of grumbling about his aging, although in fairness much of it came from anonymous sources griping to the press, and some complaints had an ableist ring to them. But as you've written, Nathaniel, some Democrats reportedly had doubts about whether he should run again at an earlier stage, and those people could have intervened in time for a primary. Almost everything else Biden accomplished will be overshadowed by that, because of course his executive and legislative legacies can be undone by Trump.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: To me, the question is, how much was Biden's legacy tied up in defeating Trump in 2020, and how much of that is undone by what happened in 2024 to bring Trump back to power?",
      "Monica has nicely linked how the campaign situation could help erode any chance for Biden to have a positive legacy. His opponent is reentering office and will attempt to undo many of Biden's accomplishments, potentially reducing the chances that anyone says in a few years, \"Wow, that thing Biden did had a long-lasting impact.\"",
      "julia_azari: I definitely think that Biden's inability to hold off Trumpism in the long term will be a big part of his legacy, but I wonder how much the particulars of the 2024 election will become a lasting part of that story.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I guess, to me, the debate and its aftermath are a microcosm of that, Julia. An easy thing to point to.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, but also, this is something we'll be able to assess a lot better in 2029, when we know how Trump's second term went. Will he do lasting damage to our democracy, as Biden and other Democrats believe he will? Or will he actually make America great again?",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Or which of those two extremes do we end up closer to \u2026",
      "nrakich: I guess neither outcome would reflect super well on Biden.",
      "Monica Potts: Right. I think the events of the 2024 campaign will be an easy thing to point to, but I also think that Julia's correct in that, down the road, there might be a broader view of what was going on this year, and it might be wrapped into a larger story about \"The COVID-19 Era,\" or something we haven't quite named yet.",
      "nrakich: Speaking of which ...",
      "Monica, I was going to go to you next, but you already said that you agree that Biden's decision to drop out was the headline of his presidency. But do you have a runner-up?",
      "Monica Potts: I think that some of Biden's accomplishments, like the Inflation Reduction Act or his efforts to forgive a record number of student loans, may very well leave a lasting impact. It's hard to tell exactly: Trump has already promised to reverse some of the components of the Inflation Reduction Act and pull back unspent money, and we may see that first with some of the tax credits that would have gone out to homeowners and car buyers for making environmentally conscious choices.",
      "But the Inflation Reduction Act also made efforts to boost manufacturing and infrastructure in the U.S., and some things, like lithium mining in Arkansas, can probably be traced to that policy. Likewise, individuals who had their loans forgiven will have a different memory of Biden's presidency, surely, and it may impact how they're able to retire or invest as they age. So we will see.",
      "julia_azari: I think this is a good point. Something I've thought about a lot since Biden's popularity dipped in 2021 is that, with the benefit of hindsight, he might start to look like Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 presidents who weren't considered terribly flashy in their own time (Eisenhower was popular but considered a lightweight by Serious Government Types) but came to be regarded as much stronger on policy and decision-making decades after they left office.",
      "(Presidential legacy-making is fascinating and someone should write a book about it.)",
      "nrakich: I agree that the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 a truly robust anti-climate-change bill \u2014 was probably Biden's biggest legislative achievement. But without tipping my hand too much, I'm skeptical that specific legislation, rather than general vibes/conditions, will be what Biden is most remembered for.",
      "I take your point about past presidents, Julia, and I think it's possible that, like Truman, people will be more impressed by Biden's policy achievements (which he accomplished with very narrow majorities in both the Senate and House) once they forget that he spent most of his presidency with pretty low approval ratings.",
      "And call me pessimistic, but I also am not sure that the Inflation Reduction Act will do enough to counter climate change to be remembered as truly transformative. We're already seeing the effects of a warming planet, and without decisive action from countries outside the U.S., the planet seems likely to get more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial baseline \u2014 a red line set by many scientists.",
      "Monica Potts: Something that keeps me up at night, Nathaniel.",
      "nrakich: What about you, Julia? What do you think has been the defining event of the Biden presidency?",
      "julia_azari: I am still trying to think of the event that really illustrates this, but in addition to what everyone has already said, I think Biden's presidency will be seen as a turning point in the Democratic Party (though in what direction I'm not exactly sure).",
      "Something we don't talk about a lot is that Biden's 2020 nomination was unusual in a way: If you buy coalition theories of nominations, Biden wasn't so much the \"acceptable to all factions\" nominee as the one considered most \"electable,\" and then, once he clinched the nomination, he had to spend time and effort reaching out to the progressive wing of the party.",
      "I see this fault line less as one on policy and more as a split between a faction that wanted to go back to \"normal\" after Trump, that favors institutions and the status quo, and one that wants to see serious change in the structure of American government and politics. Biden did try, I think, as a party man through and through, to bring these two factions together. But the 2024 election loss puts a lot of strain on that alliance. What's the Democrats' path forward? Will the status quo people win? The progressives? Or will this be a long period of push and pull, with visible intraparty strife? I don't know at this point.",
      "I can think of two events that illustrate this: (1) Biden saying \"fund the police\" in his 2022 State of the Union address and (2) \u2014 this is going to sound weird \u2014 the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not because it was clearly an action associated with either faction, but because it showed how much Biden's presidency was defined by contending with the decisions of his predecessors and how difficult it is to change directions, even as the American public soured on the Afghanistan war in particular and interventions like it in general.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: At a time when there's a major lack of faith in institutions, the perceived failures of an institutionalist like Biden could substantially influence Democrats moving forward. It connects to what I think is one of their larger challenges, which is being perceived as the party of government and status quo while the GOP is viewed as the anti-establishment force.",
      "Granted, let's be careful not to vastly overstate the meaning of a close election.",
      "nrakich: Interesting! Yeah, the future direction of the Democratic Party is definitely a big question going forward, but I think because of that, we won't know if this was a big part of Biden's legacy for a few more years.",
      "julia_azari: The corollary is that I wonder what Biden's legacy and Harris's loss (combined with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016) means for former President Barack Obama's legacy.",
      "nrakich: Now we're getting meta!",
      "I think the difference there is that Clinton's loss can't really be pinned on Obama. He was popular at the time; she wasn't. This year, Harris was more popular than Biden, so I think he is more responsible for Trump's win.",
      "julia_azari: You knew I would be annoying when you invited me. (I should get a T-shirt that says that.)",
      "Monica Potts: I think that's true, Julia, and something I hadn't thought of. What's interesting to me is that some of what Biden did as president was more progressive than the progressive wing of the party was expecting. Like Biden's National Labor Relations Board appointments, and appointing Lina Khan, a big opponent of tech monopolies, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, I would actually argue that Biden was probably the most progressive president in U.S. history? But I'm not sure if he will be seen that way, and thus I'm not sure how that will affect the establishment vs. insurgent fight that's going to play out in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary.",
      "Monica Potts: Yes, agreed.",
      "julia_azari: Yes, I see that too.",
      "And Biden's reputation with the left flank of the party might be different without the Gaza issue, which we haven't talked about. But it is part of the fault line I mentioned.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Internationally, the situation in Gaza will probably be a major part of Biden's legacy. I'm not sure it'll have as much traction in domestic remembrances, but it's worth noting.",
      "Of course, that gets at another aspect of Biden's legacy: the U.S.'s place in the world and its involvement in events elsewhere. Besides Gaza, Biden's defeat might have serious consequences for Ukraine, NATO and America's alliances generally.",
      "Monica Potts: Agreed, Geoffrey, I was thinking of that too. It's hard to know how history will assess it because Trump may change or shift U.S. policy toward Israel in ways that overshadow what Biden did or didn't do, and other countries around the world have played a role as well.",
      "And yes, Trump's win will likely have consequences for how the U.S. interacts with the rest of the world going forward too.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, will we be making Smoot-Hawley comparisons here in a few years regarding protective trade measures?",
      "(OK, I might be the only one doing that.)",
      "Monica Potts: You might not be the only one: an entire generation learned about it from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"",
      "nrakich: Yeah, foreign policy was on my short list as well \u2014 namely, Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But I think the most remembered aspect of Biden's presidency will be something that I'm surprised hasn't come up yet: the rampant inflation of 2021 and 2022.",
      "After inflation basically went decades as a non-issue, it shot up to historic levels as the economy overheated post-pandemic and crested at 9.1 percent in June 2022. It became Republicans' go-to cudgel against Biden in the 2022 and 2024 campaigns, and the cost of living consistently ranked as Americans' number-one issue in polls. The first burst of inflation was probably at least partially responsible for Biden's approval rating going from net positive to net negative in September 2021, and of course it stayed net negative for the rest of his presidency. And according to most post-election analysis, the economy was probably the biggest factor behind Trump's victory in this year's election, keeping with the theme of that being a big part of Biden's legacy.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I was sort of rolling inflation into the larger defeat story. But yes, undoubtedly Biden's presidency will be remembered for economic dissatisfaction. That might group him with other one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush: Carter's tenure saw clear economic turmoil \u2014 \"stagflation\" and a significant shrinking of the economy \u2014 while Bush's also featured a recession. However, no one really thinks back positively about Carter's presidency, whereas the elder Bush arguably has fared better in hindsight.",
      "julia_azari: As someone who sort of remembers the H.W. Bush years, it's almost amusing how much his legacy has changed over time.",
      "Monica Potts: I guess part of me wonders whether, in hindsight, inflation will be wrapped up in the pandemic story (since it was partly caused by supply-chain issues related to the pandemic) and not thought of as part of Biden's legacy. I guess I don't know whether history will lay that at Biden's feet, and it's a pet peeve of mine that voters tend to blame presidents for every single thing that happens in this free market economy of ours.",
      "nrakich: Sure, presidents actually have little control over the economy. But I think history has shown that presidents do get assigned a lot of the credit or blame for how the economy fares under their watch. Plus, many economists believe that the American Rescue Plan \u2014 Biden's first major piece of legislation \u2014 actually did contribute somewhat to inflation.",
      "julia_azari: The economic story seems complicated to me. While inflation makes the comparisons between Carter and Biden inevitable, several other economic indicators were actually pretty strong under Biden, which wasn't the case for Carter. So I think that makes 2024 different from other incumbent-party-rejecting elections like 1980 or 2008.",
      "nrakich: You guys are already getting into it, but my next and final question was going to be, where do you think historians will place Biden in the pantheon of presidents? Will he largely be remembered positively or negatively?",
      "julia_azari: I think it sort of depends on (1) who is crafting the legacy, and whether Democrats (or people in Biden's inner circle) decide they want to work on rehabilitating Biden's legacy, and (2) what the impact and legacy of Trump's second term is.",
      "Monica Potts: I think it's hard to say, but I will go back to where we started. I think Biden's most important decision from a legacy perspective will turn out to be his decision to run again, and I think not knowing when to step aside will overshadow everything else. Everything he did while in office now has to survive a Trump presidency or risks being overshadowed by it, and it would be a completely different conversation if a Democrat were taking office next year. Although, to be clear, the anti-incumbency feeling might have extended to any Democrat, and I don't know that any of them would have won.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, one-term presidents are usually not rated very highly in historical rankings, and I suspect there's a reason for that.",
      "For instance, in C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians, eight of the top 10 presidents served two terms (or quite close to two terms, like Truman and Teddy Roosevelt). The only exceptions were Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy \u2014 two presidents who didn't have the chance to serve two terms because they were assassinated.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I mean, if we're getting really cynical, in 50 years most people may only remember Trump from this era in history, making Biden something of a footnote analogous to, say, Benjamin Harrison or one of the other one-term presidents of the late 19th century (another period of intense partisanship and polarization).",
      "If I'm still around, I'll spend my dotage talking about it, though."

    "title": "Why most of Trump's Cabinet picks will get confirmed by the Senate",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 13:51:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Why most of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks will probably be confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "Nominees face more opposition nowadays, but rarely from the president's party.",
      "In the wake of his November victory, President-elect Donald Trump has already had a fairly messy rollout of his Cabinet nominees. His first choice for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration, and some of his other picks have their own personal scandals or controversies to overcome in the Senate confirmation process.",
      "Yet despite some less than optimal headlines, the Republican-controlled Senate will likely confirm nearly all of Trump's Cabinet nominees and picks for other key positions. Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority in the next Senate, so if the GOP remains relatively unified, most of Trump's nominees will get across the finish line. And with senators from the two parties now farther apart ideologically than they've ever been in modern times, almost all GOP senators will back Trump's choices \u2014 and most Democrats will probably oppose them.",
      "None of this precludes further developments that could lead another nominee to withdraw due to controversy or scandal, or that one nominee could go down to defeat on the Senate floor \u2014 something that hasn't happened since 1989. But considering Trump's especially dominant sway within his party as well as those broader trends, it's easy to see how the Senate could confirm even some of his most controversial picks.",
      "Nominees face more opposition, but senators stick with their parties",
      "Cabinet confirmation votes used to be a formality; throughout most of the 20th century, presidents' Cabinet nominees were typically confirmed unanimously or near-unanimously. But over the past 30 years, the amount of opposition to presidents' nominees to Cabinet posts and certain positions that have been or are currently considered Cabinet-level* has distinctly increased. President Joe Biden's nominees had the second-highest number of total votes against them across all confirmation votes in the Senate during his nearly four years in office. This puts him second only to Trump during the president-elect's first term, when many of his nominees encountered substantial opposition.",
      "Of course, Trump's turnover-prone first administration had a record number of nominees for Cabinet and Cabinet-level posts, so he also had more opportunities for the Senate to cast votes against his choices. Still, we can see an upward trend beyond Trump, too. The 25 Senate roll call votes for Biden's nominees was similar to the 23 that former President Barack Obama had during his second term and the 22 that former President George H.W. Bush had during his four years in office. But Biden's Cabinet-level selections produced 634 \"no\" votes, whereas Obama's generated 420, and Bush's sparked fewer than 100.",
      "Fact is, confirmation votes have grown more partisan and more contentious over time. We can see this if we break down the average number of \"no\" votes cast against each president's nominees by whether they came from their own party's senators or from the opposing party. Perhaps unsurprisingly, votes against nominees are up thanks almost entirely due to growing opposition from the party not in the White House. Inversely, senators from the president's party hardly ever vote against Cabinet-level nominees.",
      "With 53 senators in the next Congress, Republicans can afford up to three defections and still win votes via Vice President-elect JD Vance's tiebreaking vote. But in recent times, Cabinet-level nominees have faced an average of less than one vote in opposition from senators of the president's party. Biden's nominees averaged about 25 \"no\" votes during his one term, but practically all of those came from Republicans. Similarly, Trump's first term saw an average of about 29 \"no\" votes per nominee, yet almost all came from Democrats. It is true that more controversial nominees who might inspire more intraparty opposition don't necessarily make it to the floor, as the withdrawal of nominees has become more common. Still, we have to go back to the 1970s to find any presidential term in which senators from the president's party averaged more than one vote against a nominee.",
      "In light of this trend, it's unsurprising that Democrats moved to eliminate the filibuster for Cabinet selections in 2013, at the start of Obama's second term, to make it easier for him to get his nominees. Back then, Democrats held a majority in the Senate but had far fewer than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster by invoking cloture, which then allows the Senate to move to an up-or-down vote on a nominee. Tellingly, about one-in-six of Obama's picks who faced a roll call vote during his second term received fewer than 60 votes on the Senate floor, while the same was true for about one-fourth of Biden's nominees. The removal of the filibuster limitation certainly aided Trump during his first term, too, and likely will again this time around. Back then, nearly half of Trump's nominees fell short of 60 votes while still winning confirmation.",
      "An increasingly partisan Senate and nomination process",
      "Before the 1970s, presidents rarely got pushback from the Senate on their Cabinet picks. Senators mostly deferred to the president's prerogative, with the view that presidents should have the advisers and administration officials they wanted unless those choices were especially scandalous or unqualified. Consequently, the Senate OK'd most of the president's picks without even taking a recorded vote, simply confirming them by voice vote on the Senate floor \u2014 a sign that the selections faced no or extremely limited opposition. During the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, just four of 74 total nominees faced a roll call vote. Outside of denying former Atomic Energy Commission Chair Lewis Strauss the post of commerce secretary in 1959 \u2014 which you might be familiar with if you saw the film \"Oppenheimer\" \u2014 the Senate nearly always acquiesced to the president's choices. Fast forward to today, however, and virtually all Cabinet-level nominees now must contend with a recorded vote in the Senate.",
      "A combination of growing executive power and rising political polarization helped bring about this shift. Over the course of the 20th century, the power of the president and the executive branch grew at the expense of Congress, as what became known as the \"imperial presidency\" rose to hold greater agenda-setting and policy-making prerogatives. In the early 1970s, Congress attempted to rein in the presidency by passing legislation to limit the president's latitude for unilateral military action and compel the president to provide greater transparency regarding executive budgetary practices. At the same time, the Senate also began to more aggressively scrutinize and demonstrate opposition to Cabinet-level appointments. To wit, across former President Richard Nixon's roughly one and a half terms in office, one-third of his nominees (15 of 45) faced a roll call vote, a major change from his immediate predecessors.",
      "Around the same time, the two major political parties began to become more ideologically coherent and started to move apart from each other, a process that has continued to this day. Conservatives moved more clearly into the Republican camp, while liberals shifted into the Democrats' corner, changes that brought with them more distinct policy differences and greater disdain for the opposition. This produced a growing divide between the ideological stances of Democratic and Republican senators, as shown by Voteview.com's DW-NOMINATE measure, which uses senators' voting records to place them on a continuum from -1 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative). The gap between the average senator from each party has increased as Democrats have shifted to the left and, especially, Republicans have swung to the right.",
      "In this environment, nominations for Cabinet-level posts take longer and face more opposition than they once did. Consider how much longer it takes the Senate to finish confirming most of the high-profile secretariats for the 15 executive departments in a newly elected president's Cabinet. Through former President Ronald Reagan's first term, most newly elected presidents had their department heads confirmed within just a couple of weeks of taking office \u2014 i.e., by early February. But since then, each incoming president other than George W. Bush has taken until March at the earliest to fill out these top posts; Obama and Trump even took until late April. And this happened even though every elected president from Reagan to Biden (except the elder Bush) entered the White House with his party at least narrowly controlling the Senate.",
      "Trump's special flavor of party loyalty",
      "Now, this historical data doesn't mean that the next Senate absolutely will behave the same way. The controversial nature of some of Trump's choices, such as nominating vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, could brook enough opposition even within the GOP to stall out some picks. However, this is where there could be an especially impactful interaction between the increasingly polarized nomination process and Trump's particularly strong hold on the Republican Party.",
      "Pricing in increased pushback from the opposition party, members of the president's party now face greater pressure than ever to confirm nominees. Take the ongoing debate over former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for secretary of defense. Hegseth faces allegations of sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse. These sorts of personal scandals have precipitated the failure or withdrawal of many past nominees. In fact, the last time the Senate outright rejected a Cabinet pick involved both similar issues and the same secretariat: In March 1989, former Sen. John Tower's nomination to become George H.W. Bush's defense secretary failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate, driven in part by allegations of alcoholism and womanizing.",
      "Yet enough Republican senators may back Hegseth for him to join the Cabinet. The delicate position of GOP Sen. Joni Ernst exemplifies how. Ernst, who sits on the Armed Services Committee that will handle Hegseth's nomination, is the first female combat veteran in the Senate, and she also disclosed in 2019 that she'd been sexually assaulted in the past. Earlier this month, she expressed skepticism toward Hegseth's nomination, telling Fox News that she hadn't yet decided to back him. But Ernst is also up for reelection in red-leaning Iowa in 2026. Following a whirlwind of criticism from Trump and his allies, along with threats of a possible primary challenge, Ernst expressed a more favorable view of Hegseth's nomination.",
      "Trump's Cabinet-level nominees will face substantial opposition in the Senate, especially compared with past presidencies. However, there's ample reason to think that, when push comes to shove, most Republicans will vote for his picks for most offices \u2014 if not just about all of them. With 53 seats in the next Senate, the GOP is well positioned to do Trump's bidding. Otherwise, incumbent senators may have to risk their political careers to oppose some of Trump's selections.",

What changed?\u201d",

Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly, which is what the People gave us a mandate to accomplish,\" Trump wrote.",
      "GOP House leaders and Vice-President-elect JD Vance were hoping to appease both Trump's demands that any legislation to fund the government also deals with raising or eliminating the country's debt ceiling, as well as House Republicans on the right who are traditionally against any spending deal or debt limit increase.",

      "The cause of the tourists' illness over the weekend remains under investigation, Fiji\u2019s Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka said.",

      "The tourists, including Australians and an American, were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, Fiji\u2019s Health Ministry said.",

      "NEW YORK -- A triptych of criminal charges paints a searing, sometimes disparate portrait of the man accused of ambushing and killing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson as the executive arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company\u2019s annual investor conference.",
      "Filed separately in state courts in New York and Pennsylvania, and a federal court in Manhattan, and totaling 20 counts, the charges brand Luigi Mangione as both a terrorist and a stalker, accuse him of carrying a ghost gun and a fake ID, and enable prosecutors to seek life in state prison and the federal death penalty.",
      "On Monday, in the last of three court appearances in five days, the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate pleaded not guilty in New York state court to an indictment charging him with 11 counts in connection with the Dec. 4 killing, including murder as a crime of terrorism.",

      "Mangione\u2019s lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has argued that the terrorism allegations in the state case and stalking charges in the federal complaint appear to be at odds. Prosecutors are treating him \"like a human ping-pong ball and \"some sort of spectacle,\u201d she said in court Monday.",
      "Here's a look at the cases and the charges involved:",
      "Mangione\u2019s state court indictment alleges he killed Thompson to \"intimidate or coerce\" a group of people and influence government policy \u201cby intimidation or coercion.\u201d",
      "It includes three counts of murder, alleging Mangione killed \u201cin furtherance of terrorism,\u201d as an act of terrorism and with intent, and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office is prosecuting the case, said last week that the midtown Manhattan ambush \u201cwas a killing that was intended to evoke terror.\u201d",
      "The indictment also charges Mangione with seven gun-related counts and one count related to a fake New Jersey driver\u2019s license that prosecutors said he used to check into a Manhattan hostel when he arrived in the city 10 days before the killing.",
      "Prosecutors say they anticipate the state case will be the first to go to trial.",
      "After his arraignment Monday, Mangione was returned to a federal jail in Brooklyn while state and federal authorities sort out where he'll be detained while the state case plays out.",
      "A day after Bragg announced Mangione\u2019s state indictment, federal prosecutors upped the ante with a four-count criminal complaint that could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "The complaint charges two counts of stalking and one count each of murder through use of a firearm, and a firearms offense. Murder through use of a firearm carries the possibility of the death penalty, though prosecutors have not said if they will seek it.",
      "Mangione made an initial appearance on the charges before a federal magistrate judge last Thursday but was not required to enter a plea. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has until mid-January to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury.",
      "According to the federal complaint, Mangione had a spiral notebook in which he expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives. UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the U.S., though the company said Mangione was never a client.",
      "Among the entries, the complaint said, was one from August that said \u201cthe target is insurance\u201d because \u201cit checks every box\u201d and one from October that describes an intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance company CEO.",
      "Mangione was arrested on Dec. 9 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, and initially charged there with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",
      "Blair County Peter Weeks said last week that he intends to keep the case active and plans to revisit it once Mangione\u2019s murder charges are adjudicated.",
      "Mangione was arrested while eating breakfast at an Altoona McDonald\u2019s after a customer noticed that he looked like the person in surveillance photos that police were circulating of Thompson\u2019s killer.",
      "Officers found a gun that matched the one used in the shooting, a fake ID and writings that expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry, prosecutors said.",
      "Hours later, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office filed paperwork for a warrant for Mangione\u2019s arrest on a murder charge. Mangione, who was held without bail in Pennsylvania, headed off a protracted extradition fight by agreeing to be flown to New York last Thursday."

Syed was released from prison in 2022 and has remained free ever since, though his court case is ongoing. His lawyers are seeking to reduce his sentence under a Maryland law that allows people who have been imprisoned for at least 20 years for crimes committed when they were minors to seek a change in sentence.",
      "Syed was released when a Baltimore judge overturned his conviction in response to a request from prosecutors who said they found flaws in the evidence. But in August, Maryland's Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that reinstated Syed\u2019s conviction while allowing him to remain free pending a new hearing about whether he should have been released.",

Since his release, Syed has been working at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative. His lawyers, including Brian Zavin, who is chief attorney of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender\u2019s Appellate Division, also noted in Friday's filing in Baltimore City Circuit Court that Syed has been caring for his elderly parents since his release and that his father recently died.",
      "The filing also said Syed has cared for his spouse's aging parents.",
      "The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August came about 11 months after it heard arguments in a case that has been fraught with legal twists and divided court rulings since Syed was convicted in 2000 of killing his high school ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee.",
      "She was found strangled to death and buried in an unmarked grave in 1999. Syed was 17 at the time and was sentenced to life in prison, plus 30 years.",
      "David Sanford, an attorney who represents Lee\u2019s family, said in a statement Monday that \u201cif there is new and compelling evidence to support vacating the conviction of Adnan Syed, we will be the first to call for Mr. Syed\u2019s freedom.\u201d",
      "However, he said the state has not \u201cpresented a shred of new, let alone compelling, evidence which would warrant overturning a murder conviction that has withstood appeals for over two decades.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State of Maryland engaged in a charade in 2022: it recycled old evidence and, in the process, bamboozled the trial court and the public into believing that Mr. Syed was likely innocent,\u201d Sanford said, adding that attorneys will confer with the family and present their position in court in the days ahead.",
      "Syed, who is now 43, has maintained his innocence.",
      "Baltimore State's Attorney Ivan Bates is weighing how to proceed given the Maryland Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Syed\u2019s case was chronicled in the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast, which debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives. The show, hosted by veteran radio producer Sarah Koenig, transformed the true-crime genre as it shattered podcast-streaming and downloading records, revealing little-known evidence and raising new questions about the case."

      "Scores of people attended West's midday funeral at Doxa Church in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. West's casket was set up before a stage decorated with Christmas trees adorned with golden lights. A giant photograph of her was displayed on a screen above the stage throughout the hourlong service.",
      "Rob Warren, the church's pastor, fought back tears as he welcomed people.",
      "\u201cIn a sense, no one wants to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in another sense I believe we're all supposed to be here right now, to hurt and heal together. As painful as it is, I believe we really all do need this moment.\u201d",
      "According to West's obituary, she was born in St. Charles, Missouri, and graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2005. She married her husband, Jack, in 2005, in Powder Springs, Georgia. The couple has three daughters.",
      "Warren read several verses from West's personal Bible, remarking on all the handwritten notes and underlined sections throughout. He said that after Jack West gave him the Bible, the first page he turned to had the phrase \u201cthe Gospel is for everyone\u201d written in blue ink.",
      "\u201cThis is what Erin West was about,\u201d the pastor said, adding later: \u201cErin is in heaven right now with Jesus and she's more alive than she ever has been and that's the truth.\u201d",
      "Nate Kaloupek, Doxa Church's director of leadership development and equipping, gave a short elegy, describing how Erin met Jack in an online Christian chatroom and how Jack's company, Cardinal Glass, moved the couple around the country, first to Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest before they settled in Wisconsin about six years ago.",
      "Struggling at times to find his voice, Kaloupek said Erin loved the fast food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A and she showed her Georgia roots often by quipping \"love y'all\u201d or \u201chey, y'all.\"",
      "He joked that Erin was \u201creally bad\u201d at hiding her emotions and felt God had called her to work at ALCS. She led prayers for people in their church group and tracked what prayers were answered, he said.",
      "She loved camping trips with her family, wine-tasting trips with her husband and was looking forward to taking their daughters to Disney World this spring, he added, before concluding the elegy with: \u201cShe'd want me to say \u2018love y\u2019all.' Thank you.\u201d"

      "Biden converted the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The inmates include people who were convicted in the slayings of police, military officers and federal prisoners and guards. Others were involved in deadly robberies and drug deals.",
      "Three inmates will remain on federal death row: Dylann Roof, convicted of the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2013 Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.",
      "Opponents of the death penalty lauded Biden for a decision they'd long sought. Supporters of Donald Trump, a vocal advocate of expanding capital punishment, criticized the move as an assault to common decency just weeks before the president-elect takes office.",
      "Donnie Oliverio, a retired Ohio police officer whose partner was killed by one of the men whose death sentence was commuted, said the execution of \u201cthe person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has done what is right here,\u201d Oliverio said in a statement also issued by the White House, \u201cand what is consistent with the faith he and I share.\u201d",
      "Heather Turner, whose mother, Donna Major, was killed in a bank robbery in South Carolina in 2017, called Biden's commutation of the killer's sentence a \u201cclear gross abuse of power\u201d in a Facebook post, adding that the weeks she spent sitting in court with the hope of justice were now \u201cjust a waste of time.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt no point did the president consider the victims,\u201d Turner wrote. \u201cHe, and his supporters, have blood on their hands.\u201d",
      "There has always been a broad range of opinions on what punishment Roof should face from the families of the nine people killed and the survivors of the massacre at the Mother Emanuel AME Church. Many forgave him, but they can\u2019t forget and their forgiveness doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to see him put to death for what he did.",
      "Felicia Sanders survived the shooting shielding her granddaughter while watching Roof kill her son, Tywanza, and her aunt, Susie Jackson. Sanders brought her bullet-torn bloodstained Bible to his sentencing and said then she can\u2019t even close her eyes to pray because Roof started firing during the closing prayer of Bible study that night.",

She said every time Roof\u2019s case comes up through numerous appeals it is like reliving the massacre all over again.",
      "\u201cI need the President to understand that when you put a killer on death row, you also put their victims' families in limbo with the false promise that we must wait until there is an execution before we can begin to heal,\u201d Richer said in a statement.",
      "Richer, a board member of Death Penalty Action, which seeks to abolish capital punishment, was driven to tears by conflicting emotions during a Zoom news conference Monday.",
      "\u201cThe families are left to be hostages for the years and years of appeals that are to come,\u201d Richer said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay away from the news today. I\u2019ve got to turn the TV off \u2014 because whose face am I going to see?\u201d",
      "Biden is giving more attention to the three inmates he chose not to spare, something they all wanted as a part of what drove them to kill, said Abraham Bonowitz, Death Penalty Action\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cThese three racists and terrorists who have been left on death row came to their crimes from political motivations. When Donald Trump gets to execute them what will really be happening is they will be given a global platform for their agenda of hatred,\u201d Bonowitz said.",
      "Two of the men whose sentences were commuted were Norris Holder and Billie Jerome Allen, on death row for opening fire with assault rifles during a 1997 bank robbery in St. Louis, killing a guard, 46-year-old Richard Heflin.",
      "Holder\u2019s attorney, Madeline Cohen, said in an email that Holder was sentenced to death by an all-white jury. She said his case \u201creflects many of the system\u2019s flaws,\u201d and thanked Biden for commuting his sentence.",
      "\u201cNorris\u2019 case exemplifies the racial bias and arbitrariness that led the President to commute federal death sentences,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNorris has always been deeply remorseful for the pain his actions caused, and we hope this decision brings some measure of closure to Richard Heflin\u2019s family.\u201d",

Pillen was slated to leave intensive care sometime later Monday, though he was expected to remain at the University of Nebraska Medical Center for at least another day.",
      "Pillen, 68, underwent a minimally invasive procedure called a prophylactic embolization for the spleen injury.

      "The whales are North Atlantic right whales, which number fewer than 400 and are vulnerable to ship collisions and entanglement in gear. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said an aerial survey found an entangled whale about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Dec. 16.",

Adjessom's mother, aunt, grandmother and three sisters \u2014 two of whom were also minors \u2014 were also in the house. The warrant was executed as part of an investigation into Adjessom's older brother for suspected marijuana possession and distribution, according to the complaint. The 16-year-old was not a suspect; his older brother was not there and didn't live at the home.",
      "The Mobile Police Department tapped SWAT officers because the narcotics unit was understaffed, according to the complaint.",

The investigation culminated in an over 100-page partially redacted report published in May based on interviews, a review of department policy and body-camera footage.",
      "The investigation looked into Adjessom's killing and found that the officer who shot him complied with the city's use of force because Adjessom was armed and posed a threat. The report did not specify whether Adjessom was retreating with his hands up when he was shot.",
      "However, the investigation also concluded that the decision to execute the search warrant before dawn did not adequately prioritize \u201cthe sanctity of life.\"",
      "The officers conducting the raid had a \u201cpreconceived notion\u201d that the occupants in Adjessom's home were dangerous even though \u201cthere was no indication that any of the occupants had violent histories, and the target's only felony was for marijuana,\u201d the report said.",

      "The report ultimately did not recommend that the Department of Justice investigate the police department, saying that local law enforcement was willing to implement its own reforms. In March, an ordinance that would have banned no-knock warrants failed to pass in the Mobile city council.",

      "A new historical marker has been unveiled in the hometown of civil rights icon James Meredith",
      "KOSCIUSKO, Miss. -- A new historical marker has been unveiled in the hometown of James Meredith, honoring the Black man who fought white supremacy by integrating the University of Mississippi in 1962.",
      "Meredith, 91, wore a red Ole Miss baseball hat as he watched Friday's ceremony from the front seat of a pickup truck owned by Kosciusko, a town of 6,800 that is also the birthplace of media mogul Oprah Winfrey. About 85 people attended, and many snapped selfies with Meredith and his wife, Judy Alsobrooks Meredith.",
      "\u201cMost important day of my life,\u201d Meredith said in a brief interview.",
      "\u201cOver half the people here are my relatives,\" he said. \"And for relatives to stand out in the cold like they did \u2014 that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Meredith, who resists being called a civil rights leader, now lives in Mississippi's capital city of Jackson. He was born in Kosciusko and grew up on a nearby farm. He graduated from high school in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1951, and served for nine years in the Air Force before returning to Mississippi.",
      "He attended Jackson State College \u2014 the historically Black school that is now Jackson State University \u2014 for two years before suing to gain admission as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.",
      "A white mob erupted in violence when Meredith registered at Ole Miss, and U.S. marshals protected him on and off the Oxford campus. The university has honored him several times in the decades since then. Today, about 10% of students at the university are Black.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a man whose courage profoundly altered the course of history,\u201d Kosciusko Mayor Tim Kyle said Friday.",
      "While Meredith was enrolled at Ole Miss, his parents and some of his siblings lived in a small brick home in Kosciusko. The new historical marker is a short walk from that house, roughly where marshals would park when Meredith visited family in 1962 and 1963.",
      "Florida State University professor Davis Houck and his students collaborated with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History on the new marker, which also notes that Meredith was shot during a 1966 \u201cMarch Against Fear\u201d \u2014 a planned walk from Memphis, Tennessee; to Jackson, Mississippi; to encourage Black voter registration.",
      "Meredith's oldest son, John Meredith, is currently the city council president in Huntsville, Alabama. He said he was unable to attend the unveiling of other historical markers honoring his father at Ole Miss, at the site of the 1966 shooting in Hernando, Mississippi, and outside the state Capitol.",
      "John Meredith said he has fond memories of visiting his grandmother, known as Ms. Roxie, in the brick home in Kosciusko.",
      "\u201cSo all of this is quite the homecoming for me personally, and obviously my father is ecstatic about being honored this way in his hometown,\u201d John Meredith said. \"It\u2019s a great day for the Meredith family.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A retired police officer in the nation\u2019s capital has been convicted of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group",
      "WASHINGTON -- A retired police officer in the nation's capital was convicted Monday of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson convicted former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond of obstructing justice and making false statements after a trial without a jury.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond's conviction on all four counts.",
      "Lamond was charged with leaking information to former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was then under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department\u2019s Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 siege. The Miami resident wasn\u2019t at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Lamond testified at his bench trial that he never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio, who testified as a witness for Lamond\u2019s defense, said he didn\u2019t confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn\u2019t receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\u201cSimilarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond\u2019s indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\u201cOf course I can\u2019t say it officially, but personally I support you all and don\u2019t want to see your group\u2019s name and reputation dragged through the mud,\u201d Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \u201csympathizer\u201d who acted as a \u201cdouble agent\u201d for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t support the Proud Boys, and I\u2019m not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\u201d Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \u201creal-time updates\u201d on the police investigation of the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, was charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. He retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department."

      "New York City police have a person in custody who is suspected to have lit a woman on fire in the subway and then watched from a bench as she became engulfed in flames and died",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City police have a person in custody who is suspected to have set a woman on fire in the subway early Sunday and then watched from a bench as she became engulfed in flames and died.",
      "Surveillance video showed the man calmly approach the woman, who was sitting motionless and may have been sleeping, while aboard a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station and then set her on fire.",
      "Her clothing \u201cbecame fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,\u201d said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, describing the case as \u201cone of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.\u201d",
      "The man then sat on a nearby bench outside the train car and watched as officers and a transit worker extinguished the flames. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "The man was arrested hours later while riding on the same subway line.",
      "The suspect and victim did not appear to know each other and did not interact before the incident, police said.",
      "Police have the man in custody but have not yet released his identity. The woman's name has not yet been released.",
      "The man had not been charged in the death Monday afternoon, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said he is a Guatemalan citizen who entered the U.S. illegally after he had been previously removed in 2018.",
      "It is unclear when and where he reentered the U.S. Federal immigration officials will issue a detainer for him once he is charged to transfer him into federal custody, Carter said. Federal immigration officials will typically issue a detainer request to ask an agency to hold a person until he or she can be taken into immigration custody, rather than having the person released back into public.",
      "Authorities had circulated images of the man from surveillance cameras and police body camera videos taken at the crime scene. A group of high school students tipped off police to the man's presence on a train later Sunday, and he was taken into custody.",
      "He was wearing the same clothes and had a lighter in his pocket when he apprehended, police said.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez released a statement that said \u201cwe will do everything in our power to ensure accountability in this case.\u201d",
      "Police patrol the New York City subways, and there are a vast network of cameras in stations and in all subway cars.",
      "But the sheer size of the subway system \u2014 472 stations with multiple entry points and millions of riders each day \u2014 make policing the transit system a logistical nightmare.",
      "In Sunday's incident, officers were at the station but were patrolling a different subway platform. They responded after seeing and smelling smoke coming from the fire.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul earlier this year directed members of the state's National Guard to assist with random bag checks at certain stations.",
      "Violent incidents in the subway often put people on edge, in part because many New Yorkers take the train multiple times a day and often have their own experiences with uncomfortable interactions in the system.",
      "Broadly, crime is down in the city transit system this year compared to the same time period in 2023. Data compiled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show a 6% decline in what the agency calls major felonies between January and November of this year and 2023.",
      "At the same time, murders in the transit system are up, with nine killings this year through November compared to five in the same time period last year.",
      "High-profile incidents on the train, such as the case of Daniel Penny, a military veteran who choked an agitated New York subway rider and was acquitted of homicide this month, often attract national attention and further unnerve passengers."

      "In some ways, his victory marked a repudiation of President Joe Biden\u2019s economic stewardship and a protest against inflation. It came despite low unemployment and steady growth under the Biden administration.",
      "What lies ahead for the economy under Trump? Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics spoke recently to The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: It is objectively a strong economy. But that doesn\u2019t mean the man in the street agrees. If you look just at the growth numbers, they\u2019ve been strong, and the unemployment rate\u2019s pretty low. But consumer confidence remains muted. Although the inflation rate has come down, the level of prices remains much higher than it used to be. That was obviously weighing on consumer sentiment.",
      "A: There\u2019s a lot to do on fiscal policy in terms of just extending the original Trump tax cuts, which are due to expire at the end of 2025. The debt outlook is approaching 100% of GDP and is on track to be 120% of GDP within another decade. Extending the expiring tax cuts is about avoiding fiscal tightening, not introducing additional stimulus into the economy. We\u2019re not convinced we\u2019ll see further stimulus.",
      "A: During his first term, Trump used tariffs as a negotiating tool to draw concessions out of other countries. We\u2019re seeing an echo with recent threats toward Canada, Mexico and China. I think there will be a 10% universal tariff and higher tariffs on China. I don\u2019t think many countries would be able to negotiate their way out of it. This feeds through to final consumer goods prices. It will add up to 1% to inflation. But this is a one-off change rather than an increase in the ongoing inflation rate.",
      "A: It hits the economy\u2019s supply side. But it also hits demand because these people spend money. The question is, which one does it hit most, because that determines whether it\u2019s inflationary or deflationary. Our guess is that the impact on the supply side of the economy will be slightly greater, in which case we see it as slightly inflationary. Some sectors, like agriculture, construction, food processing and restaurants, would get hit harder. That\u2019s where you\u2019d expect inflation to come through \u2014 in food prices, restaurant prices. Immigration policies and tariffs could knock half a percent off growth and add 1% to inflation. It\u2019s not ideal. But it\u2019s certainly not a disaster.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The economic and technological rivalry between the United States and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player.",
      "Lawmakers in Washington are seeking to ban new sales of drones from two dominant Chinese manufacturers, arguing they could be used to spy on Americans and that the low-cost models are hurting the U.S. drone industry.",
      "A defense bill that passed Congress last week would bar new Chinese drones from DJI Technology and Autel Robotics should a review find them to pose an \u201cunacceptable\u201d risk to U.S. national security.",
      "But American users, from police officers to farmers, mappers and filmmakers, have come to rely on Chinese-made drones, especially those by DJI.",
      "Here are things to know about the debate.",
      "Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be U.N. ambassador, has led House efforts to ban new Chinese drones, saying Americans have become too dependent on them.",
      "\u201cIt is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,\u201d she argued.",
      "It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.",
      "Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could \u201cgather data or carry harmful payloads\u201d across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.",
      "DJI, named in the bill, is the best-known Chinese drone brand. The company has the lion\u2019s share of the global drone market and is a dominant player in the U.S. market. Its drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage.",
      "Founded in 2006 and based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, DJI makes devices that are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.",
      "As U.S.-China relations soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists citing human rights concerns as well as alleged links to the Chinese military. DJI has denied any wrongdoing, and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company.",
      "U.S. customs officials have also blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it \u201ca customs-related misunderstanding.\"",
      "DJI has also expressed concern about the review of Chinese drones included in the defense bill., saying it doesn't allow the company to defend itself. It called for \"a fair right of reply to any findings.\u201d",
      "Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, bean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a ground sprayer would cost $250,000, he said.",
      "As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded \u2014 something he did after Hurricane Helene.",
      "\u201cI am not going to say I won\u2019t love to have U.S. drones, but I don\u2019t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cThe U.S. drones are not as good as DJI ones but cost twice as much.\u201d",
      "At the Interior Department, the ban on foreign-made drones has resulted in a \u201closs of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,\u201d according to a September report by the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, argues against an immediate ban. Instead, the group has urged the government to support the domestic drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.",

      "Akiona, her husband, uncle, stepdaughter, and her best friend\u2019s family filled the house once owned by her grandparents, with four bedrooms, two living rooms and a spacious backyard.",
      "She remembers the happy anticipation of hearing the front door open and not knowing who'd come home. Someone was always in the kitchen cooking. Neighbors gathered in the evening to chat and share food from their gardens. Kids chased the shave-ice man as he rolled past in his truck.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff I miss,\u201d said Akiona, 51. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d",

      "The Akionas and families like them received support from a first-of-its-kind disaster-relief program. For one year, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement's Host Housing Support Program gave people who took in displaced loved ones stipends of $500 per person, up to $2,000, each month.",
      "Disaster responders and advocates say it\u2019s a powerful example of how to shape support around survivors' cultural values and preferences, while alleviating the demand for temporary housing and keeping families and communities intact.",
      "\u201cEvery single time we see a megafire we see mass displacement, and the most common displacement we see is that people then double and triple up with relatives and friends, sometimes for a few years even,\u201d said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the disaster-advocacy nonprofit After The Fire. \u201cBut what they never get is actual money to do it.\u201d",
      "Right after the fires, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, quickly learned how many displaced were bunking with friends and family \u2014 to avoid the hotels where 8,000 people were temporarily sheltered, because they couldn\u2019t find an affordable rental, or because they simply preferred it.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very normal in Hawaii where you lean on your friends and family,\u201d said Kuhio Lewis, CEO of the 23-year-old Oahu nonprofit. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the fabric of Hawaii, it\u2019s this aloha spirit that\u2019s unique to us.\u201d",
      "CNHA recognized that these informal living arrangements would be essential to keeping families housed and decided to make them part of its overall disaster response. It launched a small pilot program in October 2023 that paid households $375 per person for six months. Both host and guest went through a vetting process, including interviews and an in-person home inspection.",
      "With donations from the Hawaii Community Foundation and the American Red Cross, CNHA increased the payment to $500 per person and extended the program to 12 months. The $2.5 million effort supported 672 displaced people staying in 253 households.",
      "The money helped the Akionas pay the new condo HOA fee and gas to commute back to Lahaina. It provided a cushion when Tamara\u2019s work managing a vacation rental slowed and Kawehi, 50, took on a second job valeting cars at a hotel only to fall and break his knee.",
      "Having their own stability made it possible for the Akionas to help Tamara's uncle Ron Sambrano, too.",
      "Sambrano, 60, watched the neighborhood burn that August night. For months after, he would pull his hat over his eyes whenever he had to ride through Lahaina.",
      "\u201cIt was a special place, in less than 24 hours, all that\u2019s wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty traumatic.\u201d",
      "Living with his niece and nephew has been a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to help me out and just make things work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing. I could be on the street without them.\"",
      "While it\u2019s common for disaster survivors to get financial assistance to stay in hotel rooms or temporary rentals, paying hosts to take in loved ones hadn't been tried in the United States. Doing so can help the entire recovery, said Gray Thompson of After The Fire.",
      "\u201cIt has a lot of benefits people might not understand at first glance,\u201d she said. Placing people in already occupied homes can take pressure off a tight housing market as hundreds or thousands of households seek shelter. It can prevent kids from having to change schools, and puts money back into the local economy by helping families afford to shop for groceries and other needs.",
      "Perhaps most important, host programs can help keep families and communities intact. In the year after the fire, estimates say more than 1,500 Lahaina families left Maui due to a lack of housing and job options.",
      "\u201cWe need people to stay home in Hawaii,\u201d said Lewis. All of CNHA's housing initiatives since the fires \u2014 paying hosts, leasing rentals to families, covering rent, and even building temporary houses \u2014 are aimed at preventing further erosion of the community.",
      "Helping people stay with loved ones had unexpected upsides, too. Of the 6,000 households CNHA has helped since the fires, it found the ones in the host program moved through FEMA and Small Business Administration applications months more quickly than the others.",
      "\u201cThe greatest strength of the program was to allow the survivors time and the ability to heal comfortably, while pursuing the more challenging aspects of disaster recovery,\u201d said Skye Kolealani Razon-Olds, director of resiliency for CNHA's Maui programs.",
      "While the first-of-its-kind program ended in November, Maui isn't the only community still struggling with mass displacement. In North Carolina, 10,000 households were placed in hotel rooms after Hurricane Helene, and half are still there.",
      "When asked if the program could be replicated in other communities, an American Red Cross spokesperson said the group \u201cwill apply the successes and lessons learned for potential use in future responses.\u201d",
      "CNHA is entering its next phase, helping people rebuild and return to Lahaina. It partnered with Maui architects to offer free and reduced design plans and is giving almost 200 families grants of up to $15,000 to cover pre-building costs like permit fees, among other initiatives.",
      "The Akionas want to rebuild their home, eventually. They\u2019re waiting on a lot survey. Water hasn\u2019t been restored to their street. With building costs so expensive, they might wait until they can afford to build a house they want to grow old in.",
      "In the meantime, most of their 11-person household has moved to Wailuku or to Kihei, a 20-minute drive away. \u201cFor the most part we feel like we have our family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re as close as we can be now.\u201d",

      "Donald Trump has promised to undertake mass deportations",
      "NEW YORK -- The immigration officers sat in their vehicles before dawn near a two-story building. A New York subway line rumbled overhead, then an officer's voice crackled over the radio.",
      "After watching for about two hours, he said, \u201cI think that's Tango,\u201d using a term for target. \u201cGray hoodie. Backpack. Walking quickly.\u201d",
      "The immigration officers surrounded and handcuffed a 23-year-old man from Ecuador who had been convicted of sexually assaulting a minor.",
      "Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York, said a popular misconception is that officers can sweep into a community and pick up a wide swath of people who are in the United States illegally and send them to their home countries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called targeted enforcement,\u201d Genalo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t grab people and then take them to JFK and put them on a plane.\"",
      "With Donald Trump returning to the White House, there is intense interest in how the Republican will carry out his immigration agenda, including a campaign pledge of mass deportations. His priorities could run into the realities faced by agents focused on enforcement and removals, including the unit in New York that offered The Associated Press a glimpse into its operations: The number of people already on its lists to target eclipses the number of officers available to do the work.",
      "The Biden administration had narrowed deportation priorities to public safety threats and recent border crossers. Trump's incoming \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, says officials in the new administration also will prioritize those who pose a risk, such as criminals, before moving on to immigrants whom courts have ordered removed from the U.S.",
      "But Homan also has signaled that enforcement could be wider: \u201cIf you\u2019re in the country illegally you got a problem,\u201d he said recently on Dr. Phil\u2019s Merit TV.",
      "It's a tall order.",
      "About 1.4 million people have final orders of removal, while about 660,000 under immigration supervision either have been convicted of crimes or are facing charges. But only 6,000 officers within ICE are tasked with monitoring noncitizens in the country and then finding and removing those not eligible to stay.",
      "Those staffing numbers have largely remained static as their caseload has roughly quadrupled over the past decade to 7.6 million. About 10% of that workforce was pulled from their regular duties last year to go to the U.S.-Mexico border at times when immigration spiked.",
      "Jason Houser, ICE chief of staff earlier in the Biden administration, said the number of officers needed to pursue those deemed a public safety threat are at direct odds with the goal of deporting people in large numbers.",
      "\u201cYou're not going to be able to do both of those with the resources you have, with the deportation officers you have,\u201d Houser said. \u201cJust the arithmetic, the time-intensive nature of those sort of arrests will overwhelm any ability to get to those large scale numbers.\u201d",
      "Genalo said the officers in charge of individual cases have to get a lead, ensure they have the legal authority to arrest someone and then track the person down. They generally aren't allowed to enter a residence, so they want to catch people outside.",
      "On this recent operation, about a dozen officers gathered before 5 a.m. at a White Castle parking lot in the Bronx. After putting on their body armor and checking their equipment, they circled around for a briefing.",
      "Besides the 23-year-old Ecuadorian man, they were going after a 36-year-old Mexican man convicted of forcibly touching a young girl and another Ecuadorian also convicted of sexual abuse of a minor.",
      "The first target, the 23-year-old man, who pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old girl, was believed to usually leave the apartment building around 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m. Sometimes he was with a woman and child.",
      "\u201cLight came on in the first floor of the apartment,\u201d an officer waiting outside said over the radio. Then later: \u201cSomeone came out of the basement, but it\u2019s not our target.\u201d",
      "They finally spotted him, swept him into the back of a vehicle and quickly left the neighborhood.",
      "Inside, the man's 22-year-old wife didn't know what had happened until he called later from detention.",
      "In an interview, she said they met in Ecuador and had a child \u2014 a bubbly 3-year-old girl with braids \u2014 and she was pregnant with their second. He worked construction while she was a manicurist.",
      "She said she knew why her husband had been arrested but felt there were important mitigating factors. She said they knew it was possible her husband could be sent back to Ecuador after his criminal case wrapped up but that it was still a shock.",
      "ICE deported more than 270,000 people over a recent 12-month period, the highest annual tally in a decade, the agency said in a recent report. But it also said it made fewer arrests of noncitizens, in part because of the demand of sending staff to the border. Of those arrested, a greater proportion had serious criminal histories.",
      "Some cities and states work with ICE to turn over people in their custody who aren't U.S. citizens.",
      "But many left-leaning states and cities have so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In New York City, for example, ICE used to have an office at the jail to easily take custody of noncitizens. In 2014, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation kicking out ICE and restricting police cooperation.",
      "His successor, Eric Adams, has shown willingness to revisit some of those policies. He recently met with Homan and told reporters they agreed on pursuing people who commit violent crimes.",
      "Genalo said agents spend time and resources picking up immigrants few would argue should have the right to stay in America.",
      "\u201cHow can you state that sanctuary policies help the community when you\u2019re releasing all these criminals right back into the community?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re safer when we collaborate.\u201d",
      "Staffing is also an issue. He said he's supposed to have about 325 officers, but in recent years, the number has been about 30% lower.",
      "Many immigration advocates have long-standing concerns about ICE's tactics, and those concerns are deepening with Trump's return to office in January.",
      "Advocates say the incoming administration's position of going after public safety threats is already longtime policy. They object to rhetoric they say paints immigrants as people to be feared. They say there can be nuances in some cases: Maybe someone committed a crime a long time ago and has been rehabilitated, or someone facing a final order of removal moved and never got the notice.",
      "During Trump's first term, there were a lot of \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d where immigration officers would detain others besides those being targeted, said Jehan Laner, a senior staff attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. That destabilizes communities, she said, adding, \u201cWe saw them go after everyone.\u201d",
      "Genalo said he couldn\u2019t comment on the incoming administration\u2019s plans but stressed that officers are going after specific targets with criminal histories. He said he has a docket of about 58,000 people who either have criminal convictions or pending charges.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to be tied up for a while dealing with the criminal population,\" Genalo said.",

      "Researchers and watchdog groups say the emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce detailed and novel online reviews has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory",
      "The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce novel and detailed online reviews with almost no work has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory, watchdog groups and researchers say.",
      "Phony reviews have long plagued many popular consumer websites, such as Amazon and Yelp. They are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback.",
      "But AI-infused text generation tools, popularized by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, enable fraudsters to produce reviews faster and in greater volume, according to tech industry experts.",
      "The deceptive practice, which is illegal in the U.S., is carried out year-round but becomes a bigger problem for consumers during the holiday shopping season, when many people rely on reviews to help them purchase gifts.",
      "Fake reviews are found across a wide range of industries, from e-commerce, lodging and restaurants, to services such as home repairs, medical care and piano lessons.",
      "The Transparency Company, a tech company and watchdog group that uses software to detect fake reviews, said it started to see AI-generated reviews show up in large numbers in mid-2023 and they have multiplied ever since.",
      "For a report released this month, The Transparency Company analyzed 73 million reviews in three sectors: home, legal and medical services. Nearly 14% of the reviews were likely fake, and the company expressed a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that 2.3 million reviews were partly or entirely AI-generated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a really, really good tool for these review scammers,\u201d said Maury Blackman, an investor and advisor to tech startups, who reviewed The Transparency Company's work and is set to lead the organization starting Jan. 1.",
      "In August, software company DoubleVerify said it was observing a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in mobile phone and smart TV apps with reviews crafted by generative AI. The reviews often were used to deceive customers into installing apps that could hijack devices or run ads constantly, the company said.",
      "The following month, the Federal Trade Commission sued the company behind an AI writing tool and content generator called Rytr, accusing it of offering a service that could pollute the marketplace with fraudulent reviews.",
      "The FTC, which this year banned the sale or purchase of fake reviews, said some of Rytr\u2019s subscribers used the tool to produce hundreds and perhaps thousands of reviews for garage door repair companies, sellers of \u201creplica\u201d designer handbags and other businesses.",
      "Max Spero, CEO of AI detection company Pangram Labs, said the software his company uses has detected with almost certainty that some AI-generated appraisals posted on Amazon bubbled up to the top of review search results because they were so detailed and appeared to be well thought-out.",
      "But determining what is fake or not can be challenging. External parties can fall short because they don\u2019t have \u201caccess to data signals that indicate patterns of abuse,\u201d Amazon has said.",
      "Pangram Labs has done detection for some prominent online sites, which Spero declined to name due to non-disclosure agreements. He said he evaluated Amazon and Yelp independently.",
      "Many of the AI-generated comments on Yelp appeared to be posted by individuals who were trying to publish enough reviews to earn an \u201cElite\u201d badge, which is intended to let users know they should trust the content, Spero said.",
      "The badge provides access to exclusive events with local business owners. Fraudsters also want it so their Yelp profiles can look more realistic, said Kay Dean, a former federal criminal investigator who runs a watchdog group called Fake Review Watch.",
      "To be sure, just because a review is AI-generated doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its fake. Some consumers might experiment with AI tools to generate content that reflects their genuine sentiments. Some non-native English speakers say they turn to AI to make sure they use accurate language in the reviews they write.",
      "\u201cIt can help with reviews (and) make it more informative if it comes out of good intentions,\u201d said Michigan State University marketing professor Sherry He, who has researched fake reviews. She says tech platforms should focus on the behavioral patters of bad actors, which prominent platforms already do, instead of discouraging legitimate users from turning to AI tools.",
      "Prominent companies are developing policies for how AI-generated content fits into their systems for removing phony or abusive reviews. Some already employ algorithms and investigative teams to detect and take down fake reviews but are giving users some flexibility to use AI.",
      "Spokespeople for Amazon and Trustpilot, for example, said they would allow customers to post AI-assisted reviews as long as they reflect their genuine experience. Yelp has taken a more cautious approach, saying its guidelines require reviewers to write their own copy.",
      "\u201cWith the recent rise in consumer adoption of AI tools, Yelp has significantly invested in methods to better detect and mitigate such content on our platform,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The Coalition for Trusted Reviews, which Amazon, Trustpilot, employment review site Glassdoor, and travel sites Tripadvisor, Expedia and Booking.com launched last year, said that even though deceivers may put AI to illicit use, the technology also presents \u201can opportunity to push back against those who seek to use reviews to mislead others.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy sharing best practice and raising standards, including developing advanced AI detection systems, we can protect consumers and maintain the integrity of online reviews,\u201d the group said.",
      "The FTC\u2019s rule banning fake reviews, which took effect in October, allows the agency to fine businesses and individuals who engage in the practice. Tech companies hosting such reviews are shielded from the penalty because they are not legally liable under U.S. law for the content that outsiders post on their platforms.",
      "Tech companies, including Amazon, Yelp and Google, have sued fake review brokers they accuse of peddling counterfeit reviews on their sites. The companies say their technology has blocked or removed a huge swath of suspect reviews and suspicious accounts. However, some experts say they could be doing more.",
      "\u201cTheir efforts thus far are not nearly enough,\u201d said Dean of Fake Review Watch. \u201cIf these tech companies are so committed to eliminating review fraud on their platforms, why is it that I, one individual who works with no automation, can find hundreds or even thousands of fake reviews on any given day?\u201d",
      "Consumers can try to spot fake reviews by watching out for a few possible warning signs, according to researchers. Overly enthusiastic or negative reviews are red flags. Jargon that repeats a product's full name or model number is another potential giveaway.",
      "When it comes to AI, research conducted by Bal\u00e1zs Kov\u00e1cs, a Yale professor of organization behavior, has shown that people can't tell the difference between AI-generated and human-written reviews. Some AI detectors may also be fooled by shorter texts, which are common in online reviews, the study said.",
      "However, there are some \u201cAI tells\u201d that online shoppers and service seekers should keep it mind. Panagram Labs says reviews written with AI are typically longer, highly structured and include \u201cempty descriptors,\u201d such as generic phrases and attributes. The writing also tends to include cliches like \u201cthe first thing that struck me\u201d and \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",

      "Joining forces would create one of the world's biggest car producers alongside Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford.",
      "The potentially multibillion dollar deal to combat \"the rise of Chinese power\" was a key driver behind the plan, said Honda's chief executive Toshihiro Mibe.",
      "Mr Mibe said a plan to \"fight back\" needs to be in place by 2030, or they risk being \"beaten\" by rivals.",
      "The merger, which would include Mitsubishi - of which Nissan is the biggest shareholder -  would allow all three companies to share resources against other electric vehicle competitors such as Tesla.",
      "The growing electric car market has been increasingly dominated by Chinese-made electric vehicles, including BYD, which have posed a threat to some of the world's best known car firms.",
      "\"There is a rise of Chinese power and emerging forces and the structure of the automobile industry is changing,\" Mr Mibe told reporters at a press conference announcing the merger talks.",
      "Growing competition in China has left many car makers struggling to compete, as lower labour and manufacturing costs make local firms more nimble and able to price their goods lower than foreign counterparts, making them far more attractive to buyers.",
      "It has led to China becoming the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles.",
      "In October, EU officials said the Chinese state was unfairly subsidising its EV makers and announced big taxes on imports of EVs from China to the EU, after the majority of member states backed the plans. The tariffs are set to rise from 10% to 45% for the next five years, but there are concerns it could raise EV prices higher for buyers.",
      "'Capabilities to fight'",
      "The total sales of Nissan and Honda is more than $191bn (\u00a3152bn), said Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida.",
      "In March, the two Japanese car makers agreed to explore a strategic partnership for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "\"The talks started because we believe that we must build up capabilities to fight them, including the current emerging forces, by 2030. Otherwise we will be beaten\", said Mr Mibe.",
      "He added that the deal was not a bailout of Nissan, which has been struggling with falling sales.",
      "In November, Nissan said it will cut around 9,000 jobs as it slashes global production to tackle a drop in sales in China and the US. The cuts mean its global production will be reduced by a fifth.",
      "Nissan, once a symbol of Japan's car making strength, has spent the past few years trying to regain its footing after the arrest of longtime chief executive Carlos Ghosn.",
      "Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019, and is currently the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to find and arrest a person.",
      "Mr Ghosn, currently in Lebanon, told reporters in December that Nissan's merger plans were an act of panic and desperation.",
      "Mr Mibe said that any merger would be dependent on the turnaround of Nissan.",
      "Honda and Nissan agreed in March to cooperate in their EV businesses, and in August deepened their ties, agreeing to work together on batteries and other technology.",
      "However, any deal is likely to come under intense political scrutiny in Japan as it may result in job cuts, whilst Nissan is likely to unwind its alliance with French auto firm Renault.",

    "story": [
      "Pascual Andreu points proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914.",
      "But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.",
      "\"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\"",
      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",
      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",
      "Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told congress in late November that his government was \"making a titanic effort\" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.",
      "\"I think that official financial aid is badly managed,\" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.",
      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",
      "\"Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,\" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over \u20ac1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.",
      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming.",

      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",

      "About one in 10 of 10,506 scheduled stops were cancelled between January and November 2024, according to National Rail figures collected by train data website On Time Trains.",
      "This contributed to the north-west of England being the region with the highest rate of cancelled railway stops across Britain at 6.5%, with 611,047 cancellations.",
      "The government said it was committed to delivering the biggest overhaul of the railways in a generation, bringing services back into public ownership to reinvest in them.",

      "She said as a student in Preston, she had probably missed hundreds of hours of university because of train cancellations.",
      "\"I think most of the time, we were more stressed about our trains than our work,\" she said. \"It was mostly at evening time when we were heading back, so we were coming home later than expected and missing quite a bit of mosque.\"",
      "Meher said cancelled trains had meant travelling home in the dark more often, adding: \"If it's darker, then it's much worse and you're alone as well. It does impact your safety.\"",
      "Daniel, 19, who also commutes to university via Manchester Victoria, said he usually aimed to arrive an hour early in anticipation of cancellations disrupting his journey.",

      "Rail Delivery Group, which represents National Rail and train operators, said cancellations could be caused by weather, industrial action, trespass and track, train or signalling faults.",

      "Northern, which manages Manchester Victoria and Manchester Oxford Road stations, said it had been working hard to address train crew availability issues, to improve reliability.",
      "It said a rest day working agreement had been reached with drivers and it would continue to work with the RMT union to find a \"new way forward\" after conductors recently rejected an offer relating to Sunday working.",
      "The RMT said it was seeking further talks with the company.",
      "The Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was concerned by the figures on train cancellations. She said: \"I'm not happy about the performance of Northern Rail at the moment.\"",
      "She added that the issue with Northern \"is related to the availability of train crew specifically on a Sunday\".",

      "Network Rail, which manages Manchester Piccadilly station but does not run train services, said its job was to \"help keep passengers safely on the move\".",
      "It said it understood how frustrating disruption was for passengers and it supported train operators at the station to deliver a reliable service.",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",

      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",

      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",

      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",

      "\"It has been quite emotional [doing this production] since we lost Peter, he was such an original, unique voice,\" says Nick Park of Sallis, who died in 2017 at the age of 96.",
      "\"So it's very hard for anyone to step into his shoes. But we have been blessed with a youngish actor whom we've known for many years who can do a fantastic Wallace impersonation.",

      "\"Enormous pressure!\" he tells the BBC.",

      "Bringing the memories of the past back to life again on screen proved poignant for Geoffrey and his siblings.",
      "\"I think the way he was just filming was as any father would film his children. It was just a family guy recording, documenting a time,\" says Geoffrey.",
      "\"I think it was also because [the camera] was a new toy, so he wanted to use it.\"",
      "Growing up, being surrounded by stars from the silver screen was normal for Geoffrey.",
      "\"I mean [Frank] Sinatra was very close to the family and we used to spend a lot of Thanksgivings and Easters together. Kirk Douglas, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, they were all very, very dear friends.\"",
      "Sir Roger's daughter Deborah remembers her father couldn't keep up with Frank Sinatra's drinking and would secretly pour his whisky into the plant pots.",
      "The family would watch comedy duo Morecambe and Wise on TV on a Friday night, says Geoffrey, and then Eric and Ernie would come over for Sunday lunch.",

      "But despite being surrounded by stardom, Sir Roger was very \"self-deprecating\", says Geoffrey.",
      "\"I always say, the bigger the talent, the smaller the limousine. And he was incredibly humble,\" he says.",
      "At the end of a day's filming, Sir Roger would simply enjoy watching TV with his family in his dressing gown and slippers.",
      "\"His treat was baked beans on toast,\" says Geoffrey. \"He didn't need caviar.\"",
      "Sir Roger came from humble beginnings. He grew up in Stockwell in south London. His father was a police officer and his mother worked in a tearoom. He crafted his aristocratic English accent at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and earned money modelling knitting patterns.",
      "His big break came in 1962, playing Simon Templar in the TV series, The Saint.",

      "The last three digits of Sir Roger's phone number just happened to be 007.",
      "\"He answered the phone with '007', because that's what you do, and the voice said, 'That you are Roger,'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "Sean Connery was the closest to author Ian Fleming's depiction of the character in his spy novels, says Geoffrey, as in \"I'm going to sleep with you and kill your boss tomorrow\".",
      "\"Whereas, Roger didn't want to fire a gun really,\" says Geoffrey, \"he just sort of killed them with charm.\"",
      "He always had a very sardonic approach, says Geoffrey, and that was his interpretation, he adds.",
      "\"Let's make James Bond Roger Moore,\" he says, \"[as] opposed to Roger having to play a hired gun who is licensed to kill. And I think he was more like 'licensed to thrill.'\"",
      "This took an enormous amount of talent, says Geoffrey.",
      "Of the Bond films that starred Sir Roger, Geoffrey says his father's favourite was The Spy Who Loved Me.",
      "Growing up on movie sets was fantastic, recalls Geoffrey, but having James Bond as your father attracted quite a bit of attention on the school run.",
      "When Sir Roger came to pick him up from school one day, he remembers the car was suddenly surrounded by pupils - keen to catch a glimpse of the star.",
      "\"I thought, 'Oh, okay, he's known, I'm not the only one that sees him on the box,'\" he says.",

      "\"I said, 'Well, thanks for the heads up! How long have I got?'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "The press had already surrounded his mother's house. It creates \"a small scar to see that your pain is exposed,\" says Geoffrey. \"I think that's the worst part of being famous.\"",
      "After his split from Luisa, Sir Roger went on to marry his fourth wife, Kristina Tholstrup, otherwise known as Kiki. He had also been previously married to actress and professional ice skater Doorn van Steyn and singer Dorothy Squires.",

      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",
      "Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"",
      "7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee",
      "A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",
      "Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\"",
      "Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"",
      "8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood",
      "On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.",
      "Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\"",
      "Consequence of Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"",
      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",
      "10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet",
      "Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.",
      "Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.",
      "New York Times: \"A smart, funny, cheerfully merciless catalogue of bad boyfriend behaviour.\"",
      "Esquire: \"The range, humour, and sophistication of these 12 songs were a revelation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Children played on fairground rides designed by the world's greatest artists for a single summer before they disappeared for decades.",
      "The attractions were part of the world's first art funfair - Luna Luna - dreamed up by little-known Austrian creative Andr\u00e9 Heller in the 1970s, featuring a carousel by Keith Haring, a Ferris wheel by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a David Hockney pavilion.",
      "Visitors could wander Roy Lichtenstein's hall of mirrors and marvel at Salvador Dali's fun dome, sampling biscuits decorated by artist Gertie Fr\u00f6lich as actors dressed as nuns and flamingos milled about.",
      "A successful attraction for months, plans for a grand European tour formed - but when they later fell through, an extensive legal battle ensued and the rides were shut down, disassembled and packed away, forgotten.",
      "Until now.",
      "Luna Luna is unwrapped",
      "American entrepreneur Michael Goldberg stumbled across Luna Luna on an art blog. He'd never heard of it, despite some of the art world's biggest names contributing. Neither, to his surprise, had his friends in the industry.",
      "\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"",
      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",
      "Decades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen.",
      "His key investor? Global rap star Drake, via his investment and entertainment business DreamCrew.",
      "\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.",
      "The New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.",
      "When he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.",
      "\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.",
      "It was a sleepless night.",
      "But the next day, as more paper was removed from a second container, the light caught a toffee-apple-red handlebar to Haring's carousel, then the white floorboards of  Basquiat's Ferris wheel, which \"could have been painted days ago\". It was a moment of \"instant relief\", said Goldberg.",
      "The return of Luna Luna",
      "Unearthing the artwork wasn't the hardest part of Luna Luna's revival.",
      "Brad Gooch, author of recent official Haring biography, Radiant: The Life and Line of Keith Haring, saw Luna Luna being reconstructed, describing the feat as \"mind boggling.\"",
      "\"It was like a giant Lego with no instruction kit,\" he said.",
      "A crew of artists, carnival technicians, curators and architects worked together to meticulously rebuild Luna Luna for two years before its grand reopening in LA this March.",
      "Now, Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy has come to a Midtown Manhattan art and theatre complex, The Shed. The fair is on display alongside exhibits detailing its surreal curation process.",
      "Alex Poots, creative co-founder of The Shed, described the journey as a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark story\", in reference to the film, praising Heller's ability to commission artists of such high calibre while finding a format appealing to \"art lovers and yet to be art lovers.\"",
      "\"That is a holy grail kind of pursuit,\" he added.",
      "Most of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s.",
      "Hockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.",
      "Goldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space.",
      "Drake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.",
      "All the fun of the fair?",
      "There's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.",
      "Basquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.",
      "Haring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.",
      "\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"",
      "Poots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"",
      "But he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\".",
      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",
      "He added that ticket prices, criticised by some as being too high, are \"pretty reasonable\" as the show cost \"millions and millions of dollars to install\".",
      "Among the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.",
      "Haring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".",
      "The show is running from 20 November to 23 February, and will tour after it leaves The Shed."

      "Throughout December, Instagram feeds are flooded with pictures of Christmas trees, snaps from festive work parties \u2013 and screenshots of people's most-listened-to songs of the year.",
      "That's because at the end of every year, since 2016, Spotify releases Wrapped. The campaign pulls together what users listened to the most and usually includes their top songs, artists, and genres.",
      "It's now \"plastered across every possible social media platform known to man,\" says Dr Gillian Brooks, a senior lecturer in strategic marketing at King's College London.",
      "She says its Wrapped feature works so well because music is personal and people enjoy the nostalgia of seeing the songs that marked their lives over the past year.",
      "Since Wrapped goes viral annually, other businesses have joined in, from language learning app Duolingo to bank Monzo, all creating their own personalised \"year in review\" summaries - alongside other music streaming apps such as Apple Music and Amazon Music.",
      "Prof Jonathan Wilson, a professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London, thinks there is an ulterior motive for people sharing these end-of-year-reviews - especially on apps that people use to track their virtuous activities, like fitness and education.",
      "\"It's like bragging but without the selfie,\" he explains. \"Lots of people don't want to take selfies for various reasons but one of them is that people feel a bit cringe, that it's a bit narcissistic.\"",
      "People share information on social media if it \"enhances the image we wish to portray publicly of who we are and what we want to align ourselves with\", he says.",
      "Apps like Strava will tot up how far you have run or cycled this year, while Duolingo will tell you how many hours you've spent learning another language.",
      "Goodreads provides you with images you can share on social media displaying the books you have read this year, with details about the average page length and your top genres.",
      "\"Data is a really good way to humblebrag, as opposed to actually taking selfies in all of your best clothes surrounded by all of your best people and belongings,\" Prof Wilson adds.",
      "\"It's less like bragging and a bit more evidence-based,\" agrees Prof Caroline Wiertz, a professor in marketing at City, University of London.",
      "Spotify Wrapped is part of the festive calendar",
      "\"This is a thing now in the calendar,\" Prof Wiertz says. \"We wait for the John Lewis Christmas ad, we also wait to receive our Spotify Wrapped.\"",
      "Other brands jumping on the bandwagon include Tesco and Sainsbury's for your favourite groceries, Trainline and Uber for your most frequent journeys, Monzo and Lloyds for your spending habits, Xbox and Nintendo for your gaming.",
      "Prof Wilson tells the BBC this copycat behaviour was inevitable - the prospect of people promoting a company or product seems like too good an opportunity to miss.",

      "Reddit tells users the distance they've scrolled, measured in bananas.",
      "And though Prof Wilson says that people typically don't want to post mundane things on social media, like \"which kind of bread roll they bought,\" Sainsbury's shows shoppers whether they were the top buyers of certain products in their local area.",
      "It has led to people boasting online about being the top consumer of paprika, toilet cleaner or pickled gherkins.",
      "Year in review features can raise questions about just how much data companies collect. It is widely understood that the vast majority of apps and websites someone might use are collecting huge reams of data, which they use for marketing purposes.",
      "Dr Brooks suggests \"people blindly accept privacy preferences online\" because they want to get on with whatever they visited the website to do.",
      "Data privacy is \"not as huge of an issue as it used to be\", she says. \"If we get more targeted adverts as a result, most people I've spoken to are okay with that.\"",
      "And though people like to keep some information about themselves private, they seem to have few qualms about sharing their hobbies and leisure activities online.",

      "In that moment, most people in that court room, including the rapper's friends and family, were focussed on the relief and joy of those two words - \"not guilty\".",
      "But over the coming weeks, Slowthai - whose real name is Tyron Frampton - will begin to plot a course to overcome his ''cancellation\", and regain his status as one of UK rap music's most celebrated artists.",
      "The rapper released his first album in 2019.",
      "He has since gone on to release two more critically acclaimed albums, including 2023's UGLY - which received a five-star review from the NME's Thomas Smith, who called it the rapper's \"most exhilarating project to date from front to back\".",
      "But soon after the release of his third album, the Grammy-nominated rapper was charged with rape.",
      "He was quickly removed from the line-up of Glastonbury Festival, as well as Reading and Leeds, soon after.",

      "Two years later, JLS reformed for a 29-date comeback tour that saw the band perform to a more than 350,000 people.",
      "The musician, who has also released his own solo music since being acquitted, has seen his career climb back to, and even possibly exceed, its previous heights since his trial five years ago.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the English singer-songwriter Rex Orange County.",
      "The musician was widely regarded as a darling of modern indie music, and had released critically acclaimed albums that reached the top ten in both the UK and US charts, before being charged with six counts of sexual assault in 2022.",
      "All charges against him were dropped later that year, but the singer decided to take a two-year hiatus from music - which ended earlier this year with the release of his fifth studio album, The Alexander Technique.",
      "The album has failed to garner anywhere near as much interest as his previous efforts though, spending just one week in the UK album chart and only reaching 151 in the US.",
      "Despite seeing off the charges, Rex Orange County thus far appears to have failed to shake-off his \"cancelled\" tag and reignite his career.",
      "The stories of Oritse Williams and Rex Orange County may guide what Slowthai does next with his career - but only the general public will determine the outcome of his comeback.",
      "Marcus Johnstone says he feels there \"may be some hope\" for the Northampton-based rapper.",
      "\"His attraction is to a certain demographic who may not see the need to 'cancel' him,\" he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 02:22:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The British actress has reunited with Mike Leigh for a film that could score her an Oscar nomination.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after being nominated for an Oscar, British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste is back in the awards race thanks to a tremendous performance in director Mike Leigh's new drama, Hard Truths.",
      "The 57-year-old jokes she feels \"older and wider\" (rather than wiser) this time around - a line she credits to co-star Michele Austin, who plays her on-screen sister.",
      "But waistlines aside, her reunion with Leigh, whom she first worked with on 1996's Secrets & Lies, has prompted some of the most positive reviews of her career.",
      "Hard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who is constantly grumpy and miserable, and the impact her unspoken depression has on those around her.",
      "It would be unfair to call the film a comeback for Jean-Baptiste, because she has been working tirelessly in the intervening years. But her second collaboration with Leigh has led to renewed attention on the film awards circuit.",
      "\"It's kind of a full circle moment, rather than a comeback,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"It's very interesting, because the first time, I was not aware at all that we were even in an Oscar race. You've got to remember, in 1996, there was still a huge independent film presence in the United States.",
      "\"At that time, we weren't that aware of the whole Oscar thing. It was something that happened over there,\" she says, gesturing far away, \"with really big stars. So it really was not on our radar.\"",
      "Having won the top prize at Cannes, it was only when Secrets & Lies played at the New York Film Festival four months later that Jean-Baptiste became more aware of the awards buzz. \"I hadn't even heard of the Golden Globes at that point,\" she recalls.",
      "\"We were just talking about the film, doing loads of interviews, we were just knackered from all the plane rides, so there was a naivety to it the first time.",
      "\"Now we have the internet and it's become more of an aggressive pursuit of those awards. The campaigning process has changed quite a lot. Or maybe it hasn't and we just weren't aware of it back then.\"",
      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",
      "Older and wider, we all begrudgingly are. But Marianne Jean-Baptiste is clearly quite a lot wiser, too.",

      "Jolie added that it was \"a new way\" of finding out how to be honest with her children about her feelings, \"in an even greater way\".",
      "Written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, the film focuses on Callas's final years, in the 1970s, when she was living in Paris.",
      "With Jolie taking on acting roles relatively infrequently in recent years, the film has provided something of a comeback narrative for her and could lead to an Oscar nomination for best actress.",

      "\"It was probably one of the areas in my life that I was hesitant,\" she said.",
      "But she indicated that it was also something she enjoyed.",
      "\"One of the greatest privileges of being an actor is you often are supported by a crew to try something and explore something you've never done and this certainly was most challenging,\" she said.",

      "Both of them accompanied her at the New York City premiere of Maria in September, alongside their younger sister Zahara.",

      "The Hollywood stars also share daughters Shiloh and Vivienne, and another son Knox.",
      "On the set of the film, both Maddox and Pax were \"very busy\", director Pablo Larra\u00edn said. \"They were good professionals,\" he added.",
      "Jolie said that during filming, Pax recorded a lot of her singing practice \"so he was with me in my early horrible days,\" she laughed.",
      "\"It's always good for your children to watch your mum not do something easily, but swear and fight and fail and have to try again,\" she said.",
      "\"So that's an important and beautiful thing.\"",
      "Maria is the third in a trilogy of films about high-profile, complex women from Larra\u00edn, following his movies about Jacqueline Kennedy and Princess Diana.",
      "The film has received mixed reviews, although critics have generally praised its central performance.",
      "\"Jolie is absolutely spellbinding as Maria Callas, imbuing her with grace and resolve,\" said Sophia Ciminello of AwardsWatch. \"She doesn't disappear into the role, she transcends.\"",
      "Time's Stephanie Zacharek was less keen on her performance, however, saying Jolie \"plays her subject as haughtily cool and deeply insecure, but captures none of her imperious charisma\".",
      "Hailed as La Divina, \"The Divine One\", Maria Callas began singing at 14 years old.",
      "One of her most famous performances was as Tosca, in Covent Garden, in 1964.",
      "But vocal decline, possibly caused by dramatic weight loss, led to the premature end of her career.",
      "She spent her last years living largely in isolation, and died of a heart attack aged 53.",

      "There has been \"a catastrophic rise\" in deaths caused solely by alcohol in England over the past four years, government figures suggest.",
      "More than 8,200 people died because of alcohol in 2023 - a 42% rise on 2019 - with the North East having the highest rates.",

      "The government says it's unacceptable that alcohol deaths are at record high levels and it will prioritise public health in its 10-year plan for the NHS in England.",
      "What is minimum pricing for alcohol and how does it work?",
      "During the pandemic, deaths caused by alcohol rose sharply across the UK. Heavier drinkers were drinking more while others, including more moderate drinkers, cut down or gave up entirely.",
      "And when pubs were shut, many people started buying alcohol in shops and drinking at home.",
      "Since then, deaths have continued to go up in England - although more slowly than in previous years. Most deaths are among men, who are dying early - before the age of 75 - from alcohol-related liver disease.",
      "Analysis by the Institute of Alcohol Studies suggests 55-74-year-olds \"are now the heaviest-drinking age group\", which it says could be driving current trends.",
      "Another factor could be the cost-of-living crisis which may have triggered heavier drinking among people faced with higher bills.",

      "The alliance predicts further rises in deaths from alcohol \"and an ever greater burden on our healthcare system and society\".",
      "Its chairman, Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, said: \"Without bold, decisive action, these preventable deaths will continue to climb. Addressing alcohol harm must be a top public-health priority in 2025, and it requires a cross-government effort to turn the tide on this public-health crisis.\"",

      "The minimum cost of a unit of alcohol there has risen from 50p to 65p in recent months. This means no alcoholic drink can be sold for anything below this price.",

      "The mother of a young girl operated on by a disgraced surgeon at a famous London children's hospital said she should never have been left in his care.",
      "Jodee Seeley told BBC Newsnight she was considering legal action after Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh), whom she accuses of \"gaslighting\" her, allowed Yaser Jabbar to operate on her daughter Alana even when complaints had been raised about his misconduct.",
      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a Royal College of Surgeons inquiry found he had performed \"incorrect\" or \"inappropriate\" surgery in several cases.",
      "A spokesperson for Gosh said it understood \"why Alana and her family are worried\"  and apologised that \"they feel information was withheld from them\".",
      "Mr Jabbar had operated on Jodee's daughter in 2022, when she was eight years old, fitting metal plates into her knees for leg lengthening and straightening.",
      "He was a leading surgeon at the renowned hospital, operating on children with complicated disorders and carrying out procedures, such as the one undergone by Alana, who has a complex chromosome abnormality.",
      "The hospital has since initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients to conclude what level of harm they had experienced.",
      "Some cases linked to Mr Jabbar resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Jodee, from Essex, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that she had no idea of the doctor's reputation when her daughter Alana was referred to his care in 2021.",
      "At that point, concerns had already been raised about Mr Jabbar.",
      "She said that at the family's first consultation in March 2021, which lasted \"about five minutes\", Mr Jabbar had advised the invasive surgery.",
      "\"We didn't want to rock the boat too much because he seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing,\" she said.",
      "\"So we kind of went along with it thinking he's an orthopaedic surgeon, it's Great Ormond Street [Hospital]. We trusted him.\"",
      "She said she was told the surgery would improve Alana's mobility and put her \"knee into place... and then from there we could assess whether anything else needed to be done\".",
      "The operation took place 10 months later, in January 2022. During that period, more professional complaints from other surgeons were raised with the managers at the hospital.",
      "None of this was ever disclosed to Jodee or other families of Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "She said the surgery had appeared to go well and, with Alana's leg bandaged up, there had not seemed to be any immediate problems.",
      "But when the bandage came off a few weeks later, Jodee saw two scars instead of one on the inside of her child's leg when they had been told it would be just one incision.",
      "\"The alarm bells rang at that point,\" she said.",
      "As weeks went by, the mobility of Alana, now aged 11, was not improving and she was reporting pain frequently, often needing painkillers.",
      "Jodee said she had thought at first: \"Well, maybe it just hasn't worked? Maybe that wasn't the right procedure and it will be removed? Or maybe it's just too early to tell?\"",
      "She said she had expected regular check-ups from the hospital but a follow-up appointment did not come until July - six months after the operation.",
      "The plates in Alana's knees were supposed to be there for about two years and Jodee says another surgeon at the hospital recommended keeping the plates in place at the follow-up appointment.",
      "Then, by chance, they saw Mr Jabbar on the same visit.",
      "Jodee said he took one look and said they \"needed to come out immediately\" and asked the family to return the following day for another major operation.",
      "He told the family he was worried Alana's tendons could re-fuse to the metal plates, Jodee said.",
      "\"We were really panicked, we were really worried.... [thinking] 'What have we done, is she okay, is it long-term damage?'\"",
      "They returned to the hospital in August 2022 to have the plates removed.",
      "But the family's concern was now so strong that they moved Alana to a different hospital months after.",
      "Jodee said her daughter's mobility was now \"worse\" and that she was \"still having falls\".",
      "Jodee said she was not informed of anything wrong with Mr Jabbar's work until February this year, more than 16 months on.",
      "She said the hospital informed her only in a brief letter with few details.",
      "\"It seemed like quite a general letter... nothing to worry about,\" she said.",
      "She did not realise the extent of Mr Jabbar's reported misconduct until media reports.",
      "\"I did not realise the scale of it or what actually happened or that there had been so many complaints,\" she added.",
      "\"I just felt sick, to be honest,\" she said. \"So obviously devastated. As a parent, obviously you want to protect your child, it is the number one priority. And I knew something was amiss when we had seen him.\"",
      "Jodee said her daughter should never have been put under the surgeon's care and has accused the hospital of a culture of complicity.",
      "She told the BBC she had heard from the hospital immediately prior to talking to reporters.",

      "\"It does actually feel like they've been gaslighting the whole way,\" she added.",

      "\"It's really important for other people to know what's happened and to understand if they're being gaslighted as well, that they're not alone, that this is what's going on,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for the hospital said it was sorry to all concerned families, adding that after the Royal College of Surgeons report, it had asked external experts to review all Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "The statement goes on: \"They are working at pace [...]  We understand why Alana and her family are worried [...] and we have reached out to them.",
      "\"We are sorry they feel that information was withheld from them. Once concerns were raised about the surgeon's practice in June 2022, we shared these with the General Medical Council and undertook rapid fact-finding. During this period the surgeon's practice was restricted to simple procedures [...] and always as part of a wider surgical team.",

      "Net migration hit a record in the year to June 2023 - with the difference between those arriving in the UK and leaving standing at 906,000 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The net figure dropped to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",
      "The previous Conservative government's key migration policy was the Rwanda deportation scheme designed specifically to deter small boat crossings.",
      "No flights were able to take off to the east African country before July's election after numerous legal challenges, and Labour swiftly scrapped the scheme after winning power.",

      "Water UK, the trade body for water firms, said the price increases would provide \"much needed\" investment for the sector.",
      "Over the next five years, the average rise in bills will be \u00a331 a year, but Ofwat said firms are expected to hike tariffs more in the first year.",
      "However, the rises don't include inflation, which means actual bills are likely to be higher.",

    "summary": "From fears of an election wipeout to bouncing back with the budget, John Swinney reflects on a chaotic 2024.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",

      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",

      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",

      "The BBC made a complaint to the US tech giant after Apple Intelligence, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarise and group together notifications, falsely created a headline about murder suspect Luigi Mangione.",
      "The AI-powered summary falsely made it appear that BBC News had published an article claiming Mangione, the man accused of the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. He has not.",
      "Now, the group Reporters Without Borders has called on Apple to remove the technology. Apple has made no comment.",
      "Apple Intelligence was launched in the UK last week.",
      "Reporters Without Borders, also known as RSF, said it was was \"very concerned by the risks posed to media outlets\" by AI tools.",

      "Vincent Berthier, the head of RSF's technology and journalism desk, added:  \"AIs are probability machines, and facts can't be decided by a roll of the dice.",
      "\"RSF calls on Apple to act responsibly by removing this feature. The automated production of false information attributed to a media outlet is a blow to the outlet's credibility and a danger to the public's right to reliable information on current affairs.\"",

      "When the grouped notification involving BBC News emerged, a spokesperson from the BBC said the corporation had contacted Apple \"to raise this concern and fix the problem\".",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:22:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Wattan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",
      "\"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\"",

      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",

      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",

      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",

      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",

      "Former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz spent tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs while serving as a US congressman, according to a long-awaited report from the House of Representatives ethics committee.",
      "It follows a years-long investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump wanted to serve as the nation's top lawman.",
      "The committee also found evidence that Gaetz, 42, received gifts in excess of permissible amounts in connection to a 2018 trip to the Bahamas.",
      "The former lawmaker has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a smear campaign. Amid the controversy, he withdrew from consideration to serve as US attorney general.",
      "The congressional ethics report found that \"there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"",
      "From 2017 to 2020, Gaetz made payments totalling more than $90,000 (\u00a372,000) to 12 different women \"that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use\", the report found.",
      "Additionally, the report contains testimony that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017, giving her $400 \"which she understood to be payment for sex\". Gaetz has denied having sex with a minor.",
      "The Department of Justice also investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.",
      "In a last-minute court filing on Monday, Gaetz sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the report's release. He accused the ethics committee of trying to exercise its jurisdiction over a private citizen.",
      "The committee's 42-page report accuses Gaetz of being \"uncooperative\" throughout its review, and that he would frequently \"deflect, deter, or mislead\" the panel \"in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".",
      "Despite a subpoena, he never appeared before the committee to testify.",
      "Gaetz represented Florida's first congressional district in the US House of Representatives, having come to power in the same election in 2016 that propelled his ally Trump to the White House the first time.",
      "Gaetz got married in 2021 to his current wife, Ginger, who has supported the former Florida congressman as he's faced the allegations.",
      "She posted a photo on X of her husband with the caption \"unemployment has never looked so good\" after he withdrew his name to serve as attorney general after resigning from Congress.",
      "Gaetz was believed to be beyond the reach of the committee when he resigned from Congress last month, following his nomination by Trump to serve as US attorney general - America's top law enforcement official who heads the Department of Justice.",
      "Trump picked Gaetz in part because he is an ultra-loyalist who had also pledged to take on the \"weaponised\" legal system that supporters believe targeted Trump.",
      "He has been one of Trump's most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. But many Republicans in Congress, including those tasked with voting on such nominations, were aghast at the choice and successfully challenged it.",

      "An intense debate had erupted over whether or not the report should be released, particularly after Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the top justice department role.",
      "He said that he hoped to avoid a \"needlessly protracted Washington scuffle\".",
      "Gaetz's slated role as attorney general was one of those that required the confirmation of US senators, and it did not seem that he had the required support.",

      "House Republicans previously blocked Democratic efforts to unveil the results of the report, but two of them later voted to do so, according to CBS.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz posted on X that the committee chose to release the report close to Christmas \"and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses\".",
      "Last week, he posted that the ethics committee planed to \"post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "He acknowledged in a previous post on X that his 30s was an era of \"working very hard - and playing hard too\".",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life,\" he wrote. \"I live a different life now.\"",

      "Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter.",
      "Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina.",
      "\"I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control.",
      "Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse.",
      "The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients.",
      "The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds.",
      "Pierre is one of them.",
      "He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone.",
      "\"I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs,\" he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital.",
      "To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023.",
      "Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order.",
      "On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear.",
      "Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up.",
      "Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access.",
      "The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire.",
      "Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls.",
      "After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on.",
      "But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street.",
      "One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning.",
      "The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted.",
      "Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country.",
      "The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise.",
      "Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission.",

      "\"The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,\" he says.",

      "The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low.",
      "The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000.",
      "And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police.",
      "In one such area, Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December.",
      "In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks.",
      "And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year.",
      "One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina.",
      "As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince.",
      "Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians.",
      "Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list.",
      "Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members \"love our country a lot\" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men \"do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us\".",
      "The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: \"The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state.\"",
      "He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too.",
      "With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people.",

      "Some of the executions were filmed by Russian forces themselves, while others were observed by Ukrainian drones hovering above.",
      "The killings captured on such videos usually take place in woods or fields lacking distinctive features, which makes confirming their exact location difficult.

Are their commanders being quite clear about what the Geneva Conventions say about the treatment of prisoners of war? What are Russian military commanders telling their units about their conduct? What steps is the chain of command taking to investigate these instances? And if higher ups are not investigating, or not taking steps to prevent that conduct, are they aware that they too are criminally liable and can be held accountable?\" she asks.",

      "Cyclone Chido has killed 94 people in Mozambique since it made landfall in the east African country last week, local authorities have said.",
      "The country's National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management (INGD) said 768 people were injured and more than 622,000 people affected by the natural disaster in some capacity.",
      "Chido hit Mozambique on 15 December with winds of 260 km/h (160mph) and 250mm of rainfall in the first 24 hours.",
      "The same cyclone had first wreaked havoc in the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, before moving on to Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.",
      "In Mozambique, the storm struck northern provinces that are regularly battered by cyclones. It first reached Cabo Delgado, then travelled further inland to Niassa and Nampula.",
      "The country's INGD said the cyclone impacted the education and health sector. More than 109,793 students were affected, with school infrastructure severely damaged.",
      "Some 52 sanitary units were damaged, the INGD said, which further risks access to essential health services. This is exacerbated further in areas where access to healthcare facilities were already limited before the cyclone.",
      "Daniel Chapo, leader of Mozambique's ruling party, told local media the government is mobilising support on \"all levels\" in response to the cyclone.",
      "Speaking during a visit to Cabo Delgado on Sunday, one of the most badly affected areas, Chapo said the government is working alongside the INGD to ensure those affected in the provinces of Mec\u00fafi, Nampula, Memba and Niassa can rebuild.",
      "In Mayotte, Chido was the worst storm to hit the archipelago in 90 years, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling from the catastrophe.",
      "The interior ministry in its latest update confirmed 35 people had died.",
      "Mayotte's prefect previously told local media the death toll could rise significantly once the damage was fully assessed, warning it would \"definitely be several hundred\" and could reach thousands.",
      "More than 1,300 officers were deployed to support the local population.",
      "One week on, many residents still lack basic necessities, while running water is making a gradual return to the territory's capital. The ministry has advised people to boil water for three minutes before consuming it.",
      "Around 100 tonnes of equipment are being delivered each day, the ministry said, as an air bridge was built between Mayotte, Reunion and mainland France.",
      "In a statement on Friday, interior minister Bruno Retailleau said 80 tonnes of food and 50 tonnes of water had been distributed across Mayotte that day.",
      "Tropical cyclones are characterised by very high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, which are short-term rises to sea-levels. This often causes widespread damage and flooding.",
      "The cyclone, the INGD said, \"highlights once again, the vulnerability of social infrastructures to climate change and the need for resilient planning to mitigate future impacts\".",
      "Assessing the exact influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones can be challenging due to the complexity of these storm systems. But rising temperatures do affect these storms in measurable ways.",
      "The UN's climate body, the IPCC, previously said there is \"high confidence\" that humans have contributed to increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, and \"medium confidence\" that humans have contributed to the higher probability of a tropical cyclone being more intense.",

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.",
      "The meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, says the legal filing.",
      "Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit.",
      "Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director.",
      "In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\".",
      "In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film.",
      "Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint.",
      "Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.",
      "Ms Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a \"multi-tiered plan\" to wreck her reputation.",
      "She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\".",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\".",
      "In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"",
      "She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence.",
      "Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni.",
      "Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet.",
      "It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar.",
      "It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.",
      "In an interview with the BBC at the film's premiere in August, Ms Lively said she had felt the \"responsibility of servicing the people that care so much about the source material\".",
      "\"I really feel like we delivered a story that's emotional and it's fun, but also funny, painful, scary, tragic and it's inspiring and that's what life is, it's every single colour,\" said the actress.",
      "Ms Lively, who is also credited as a producer, told the BBC she felt the film had been made \"with lots of empathy\".",

    "title": "Four revelations from the House ethics report on Matt Gaetz",
    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 21:40:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The report gives fresh details about the former Florida congressman's alleged payments for sex and drugs.",
    "story": [
      "The House Ethics Committee report on Donald Trump ally Matt Gaetz released on Monday revealed fresh details about the former congressman's alleged behaviour, at least one new accusation and insights into the panel's investigation.",
      "From at least 2017 to 2020, the committee concluded that the former Florida congressman regularly paid women for \"engaging in sexual activity\", had sex with a 17-year-old girl, used or possessed illegal drugs, accepted gifts beyond House limits and helped a woman obtain a passport, according to the report.",
      "Gaetz, who resigned from the US House of Representatives in November - days before the report was scheduled to be made public and after Trump announced him  as his pick for US attorney general - denied the committee's findings and has accused it of conducting an unfair investigation.",
      "Here are four parts of the much-anticipated report that stand out.",
      "A winding money trail",
      "House investigators said Gaetz paid more than $90,000 (\u00a371,843) to women for sex and drugs, but created a complicated web of transactions that were hard to trace, according to the report.",
      "\"The committee was unable to determine the full extent to which Representative Gaetz's payments to women were compensation for engaging in sexual activity with him,\" the report found.",
      "He allegedly used his friend Joel Greenberg, currently serving 11 years in prison for crimes he said he committed with Gaetz, as a frequent go-between and logged onto Greenberg's account on SeekingArrangement.com, which bills itself as a \"luxury dating site\", to interact with young women.",
      "Gaetz also paid women directly, sometimes through platforms such as Venmo, according to the report. But the committee said he often used another person's PayPal account or an account linked to an email address with a fake name.",
      "He also obscured payments, the panel wrote. In one example, he gave a college student a cheque made out to  \"cash\" with \"tuition reimbursement\" in the memo line. The woman said she received it after a group encounter,  which \"could potentially be a form of coercion because I really needed the money\".",
      "Gaetz has posted on social media that he gave money to women he was involved with as gifts, not payments. The committee found that two women, aged 27 and 25, did not consider their relationships transactional.",
      "Another woman who was considered his girlfriend invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if she was given money for sex or drugs, or to pay others.",
      "The committee attempted to prove Gaetz frequently paid for sex through a text message that described his inability to pay at one point.",
      "His then-girlfriend said in the message that he and Greenberg were \"a little limited in their cash flow\" and asked a group of women \"if it can be more of a customer appreciation week\".",
      "A few months later, according to the committee, she wrote: \"Btw Matt also mentioned he is going to be a bit generous cause of the 'customer appreciation' thing last time.\"",
      "Sex, drugs, and a passport application",
      "The committee also said Gaetz bought illegal drugs or reimbursed people for them.",
      "It gives examples of his alleged cocaine and ecstasy/MDMA use, but focused on what appeared to be a heavy marijuana habit. He allegedly asked women to bring marijuana cartridges to meetings and events, and created the fake-name email account to buy marijuana.",
      "A trip he took to the Bahamas \"was paid for by an associate of Representative Gaetz with connections to the medical marijuana industry, who allegedly also paid for female escorts to accompany them\", according to the report.",
      "One woman felt the use of drugs and alcohol at parties had impaired her ability \"to really know what was going on or fully consent\".",
      "\"Indeed, nearly every woman that the committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption,\" the report said.",
      "His then-girlfriend, who was 21 when they met and  \"was paid tens of thousands of dollars\" during their two-year relationship\", often participated in encounters with women and acted as an intermediary, according to the report.",
      "A woman told the committee she was 17 at the time she had sex with Gaetz twice at a party in 2017 - at least once in front of other people -  while under the influence of ecstasy. The woman, who had just completed her junior year in high school, then received $400 from him.",
      "She also told the panel she did not tell Gaetz she was a minor and the committee did not find any evidence that the former congressman knew she was underage.",
      "In 2021, Greenberg pleaded guilty to sex trafficking the girl.",
      "Gaetz also allegedly directed his chief of staff to expedite a passport application for a woman he was sleeping with, whom he said was a voter in his district. He also allegedly gave her $1,000.",
      "Gaetz violated House rules that bar using his position for special favours, according to the committee, which wrote: \"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases\".",
      "Accusations of obstruction",
      "The committee dedicated a great deal of the report to detailing how Gaetz allegedly obstructed its investigation, including failing to produce evidence he said would \"exonerate\" him.",
      "The report concluded he \"continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".",
      "Gaetz, who has accused the committee of being \"weaponised\" against him and leaking information to the press, alleged the panel was working on behalf of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to the report. Last year he helped lead an effort to oust then-Speaker McCarthy from his role.",
      "While Gaetz claimed he had \"voluntarily produced tens of thousands of records,\" he gave the committee \"only a couple hundred records, more than 90% of which was either irrelevant or publicly available,\" the report found.",
      "One sore point was a trip to the Bahamas, where the committee said he withheld information. Ultimately it concluded he violated rules on gifts because the trip was too high in value.",
      "The committee also cited the Justice Department's probe into the allegations against Gaetz as a reason for delays.",
      "Some witnesses asked the committee to use statements they had given to the department, but it refused to share them because they had not issued charges and because it said it could deter future witnesses in other cases from coming forward.",
      "Committee chairman dissents",
      "The report ends with a single-page statement  from Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest \"on behalf of dissenting committee members\" who are not named.",
      "Those members do not challenge the committee's findings, but disagree with releasing the report after Gaetz resigned from the House, which has not happened since 2006, they write.",
      "It  \"breaks from the Committee's long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponise the Committee's process\"."

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:12:51 GMT",
    "summary": "India is fast becoming a major live industry market but poor facilities at concerts have left fans unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Amrita Kaur decided to attend Punjabi pop star Diljit Dosanjh's concert in India this month, she was prepared to experience some discomfort.",
      "Having attended several concerts in the past, Ms Kaur was sort of looking forward to the \"exhilarating chaos\" that comes with large crowds at big events in India.",
      "But what awaited her was far worse than she had imagined.",
      "Crowd control was minimal and sanitation non-existent. Overloaded mobile networks stopped working, sparking fears about personal safety. Even using the toilet felt like a gamble, she said, as it meant having to spend the rest of the performance queued up in front of \"unhygienic, smelly cubicles\".",
      "The venue, a massive piece of government-owned land in the northern city of Chandigarh, had no public transport connections or parking space, leaving Ms Kaur with no option but to drive her car to a friend's nearby - and then get stuck in the inevitable, hours-long traffic jam once the concert had ended.",
      "\"You pay so much for a ticket and what do you get in return? A possible urinary infection and a bad headache with some bouts of music,\" she says about her experience.",
      "This year has been big for India's burgeoning concert industry, with major tours by Dua Lipa, Dosanjh and Maroon 5 packing stadiums and grounds already thrilling audiences. Other international acts like Green Day, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are set to perform in the coming months.",
      "In fact, India's music concerts generated about 8bn rupees ($94.1m; \u00a375.3m) in revenue last year - a figure that is set to increase by 25% by the end of 2025.",
      "Young, well-to-do Indians are not just willing to pay more to see their favourite music stars, but are actively seeking out these events. In 2023, more than 400,000 people in India said they travelled to other Indian cities to attend live events.",
      "But despite the enthusiasm, many concertgoers say their experience has been far from ideal. The issue made headlines earlier this week, when a diabetic patient with incontinence issues said he ended up soiling himself at a Bryan Adams concert due to unavailability of washrooms at the venue.",
      "On the same day, Dosanjh, who has been on a nationwide tour, shocked his fans by announcing that he wouldn't perform in India again until the infrastructure at concert venues got better. The singer later clarified he was referring to only one of the venues.",
      "Since then, social media has been awash with similar complaints from concertgoers. From booking tickets on dodgy scalping websites for astonishingly high prices, to braving hours-long traffic before and after a show, often on a full bladder, fans say they have to pay with more than just money to see their favourite acts.",
      "Those who have the means are now opting to attend shows in other countries for a safer and generally more fun experience. \"At Adele's concert in Munich, the staff continuously cleaned the toilets and it was super clean even after a three-hour concert,\" says Ishika Goon, a Bengaluru-based lawyer. \"If I have to spend so much money, I might as well go for the full experience.\"",
      "Organisers and promoters acknowledge the problems but say they too are hobbled by wider infrastructural challenges.",
      "That's because India does not have enough venues dedicated to live concerts, forcing them to opt for suboptimal spaces or simply avoid certain cities altogether, all of which prevents the industry from scaling up, says Anmol Kukreja, the co-founder of Skillbox, a live entertainment company that has organised more than 300 concerts.",
      "Unlike a lot of western countries where concert venues are plenty, he says that events in India have to be held in places like malls, sports stadiums or on public land - all of which come with their own limitations and many variables.",
      "A mall might have better toilets and designated parking areas, but it won't necessarily be able to accommodate huge crowds the way a large barren ground located in a far-flung corner of the city with bad connectivity might.",
      "Nowadays, a lot of music events are held inside public stadiums to minimise some of the inconveniences - but that comes with its own challenges, such as poor sound quality, crowd management issues and lots of red tape.",
      "Government-owned venues are more suitable for big events, but the process of booking them can often be a complex \"web of permissions and licences, making them less attractive\", Mr Kukreja says.",
      "To address these gaps, organisers end up spending thousands of dollars on building temporary infrastructure at venues - the stage, temporary bathrooms and parking spaces - before each concert which could incur serious losses, adds Tej Brar, founder of Mumbai-based Third Culture and the director of NH7, one of India's biggest music festivals.",
      "And it's not just business that suffers, the live music scene is impacted too, as a whole segment of smaller and independent artists are left out because they are not \"big enough\" to make people want to pay an exorbitant price to watch them.",
      "\"If they can't pull crowds of more than 10,000 people or more, they usually won't get shows because the economics won't work for the organisers.\"",
      "But of late, even major international music festivals with star-studded line-ups and million-dollar budgets have left fans disappointed.",
      "\"Everything is fine but why can't you have clean toilets?\" asks Sreoshi Mukherjee, a Delhi-based journalist.",
      "Ms Mukherjee, who attends music concerts around the country, was particularly aghast by the lack of washrooms at Lollapalooza and Backstreet Boys, tickets for which cost anywhere between 5,000 ($59; \u00a347) and 10,000 ($118; \u00a394) rupees.",
      "\"There was a point when the loos ran out of both toilet paper and water. We had to actually buy water bottles to relieve ourselves,\" she says.",
      "Criticism against inflated ticket prices turning these events into highbrow cultural experiences meant for only a few has been mounting, but there are other accessibility concerns as well.",
      "Most venues have little to no arrangements for people with disabilities - such as wheelchair access and audio description. At Dosanjh's Chandigarh concert, Ms Kaur said they had to carry their wheelchair-using friend into the venue as there was no ramp or accessibility lane.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the organisers of all the events mentioned in the story for comment.",
      "Others in the business say there can't be a one-size-fits all solution for the problems, but they worry about its longer impact on business. Right now, people are still willing to pay. But persistently poor facilities might change their minds.",
      "\"Word-of-mouth plays a crucial role in event attendance, and negative feedback can be damaging to an organiser's reputation,\" Mr Brar says.",
      "But the onus to fix that, he adds, needs to be shared. \"While the company takes charge of choosing the location and setting ticket prices, the venue should provide fundamental amenities. Adequate washroom facilities and dedicated cleaning staff should be a venue standard.\"",
      "As the country gears up to host big names like Sheeran and Green Day, fans are hoping for a better experience.",
      "And for some, huge crowds and the risk of a potential infection still feels like a small price for seeing their favourite star.",
      "\"There's a thrill to the mess and chaos,\" says Mohammad Sami, a student.",
      "\"It's like you're stuck on an island with hundreds of strangers, united by their determination to survive the night.\""

      "She told the BBC her husband remains \"strong and persevering\" in a \"tiny little room\" behind six prison gates, but she was worried that he could be \"harmed\".",
      "\"I'm not leaving Besigye's food at the gate [as directed]. I will go there and see my husband because I don't trust them with him even for a single day,\" Ms Byanyima said.",

    "summary": "The mosaics in Monreale cathedral, in Sicily, span over 6,400 sq m and contain 2.2 kilos of solid gold.",
    "story": [
      "On a hill overlooking the city of Palermo, in Sicily, sits a lesser-known gem of Italian art: the cathedral of Monreale.",
      "Built in the 12th century under Norman rule, it boasts Italy's largest Byzantine-style mosaics, second in the world only to those of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.",
      "Now, this Unesco World Heritage site has undergone an extensive restoration to bring it back to its former glory.",
      "The Monreale mosaics were meant to impress, humble and inspire the visitor who walked down the central nave, following the fashion of Constantinople, the capital of the surviving Roman empire in the east.",
      "They span over 6,400 sq m and contain about 2.2kg of solid gold.",
      "The restoration lasted over a year, and in that time the cathedral was turned into a bit of a building site, with a maze of scaffolds set up on the altar and transept.",
      "Local experts from the Italian Ministry of Culture led a series of interventions, starting with the removal of a thick layer of dust that had accumulated on the mosaics over the years.",
      "Then they repaired some of the tiles that had lost their enamel and gold leaf, making them look like black spots from down below.",
      "Finally, they intervened in the areas where the tiles were peeling off the wall and secured them.",
      "Working on the mosaics was a challenge and a big responsibility, says Father Nicola Gaglio.",
      "He has been a priest here for 17 years and has followed the restoration closely, not unlike an apprehensive dad.",
      "\"The team approached this work almost on their tiptoes,\" he tells me.",
      "\"At times, there were some unforeseen issues and they had to pause the operations while they found a solution.",
      "\"For example, when they got to the ceiling, they realised that in the past it had been covered with a layer of varnish that had turned yellowish. They had to peel it off, quite literally, like cling film.\"",
      "The mosaics were last partly restored in 1978 , but this time the intervention had a much wider scope and it included replacing the old lighting system.",
      "\"There was a very old system. The light was low, the energy costs were through the roof and in no way it made justice to the beauty of the mosaics,\" says Matteo Cundari.",
      "He's the Country Manager of Zumtobel, the firm that was tasked with installing the new lights.",
      "\"The main challenge was to make sure we'd highlight the mosaics and we'd create something that answers to the various needs of the cathedral,\" he adds.",
      "\"We also wanted to create a completely reversible system, something that could be replaced in 10 or 15 years without damaging the building.\"",
      "This first tranche of works cost 1.1 million euros. A second one, focussing on the central nave, is being planned next.",
      "I ask Fr Gaglio what it was like to see the scaffolding finally come off and the mosaics shine in their new light. He laughs and shrugs.",
      "\"When you see it, you're overwhelmed with awe and you can't really think of anything. It's pure beauty,\" he says.",
      "\"It's a responsibility to be the keeper of such world heritage. This world needs beauty, because it reminds us of what's good in humanity, of what it means to be men and women.\""

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:20:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The feud between Lively and Baldoni is alleged to have started during filming of It Ends With Us.",
    "story": [
      "From the moment Justin Baldoni announced in 2019 that he was adapting the best-selling book It Ends With Us into a film, there was a widespread frenzy.",
      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 08:46:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Through sources and footage, the BBC pieces together how China cracked down on the protests.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of Tibetans protesting against a Chinese dam were rounded up in a harsh crackdown earlier this year, with some beaten and seriously injured, the BBC has learnt from sources and verified footage.",
      "Such protests are extremely rare in Tibet, which China has tightly controlled since it annexed the region in the 1950s. That they still happened highlights China's controversial push to build dams in what has long been a sensitive area.",
      "Claims of the arrests and beatings began trickling out shortly after the events in February. In the following days authorities further tightened restrictions, making it difficult for anyone to verify the story, especially journalists who cannot freely travel to Tibet.",
      "But the BBC has spent months tracking down Tibetan sources whose family and friends were detained and beaten. BBC Verify has also examined satellite imagery and verified leaked videos which show mass protests and monks begging the authorities for mercy.",
      "The sources live outside of China and are not associated with activist groups. But they did not wish to be named for safety reasons.",
      "In response to our queries, the Chinese embassy in the UK did not confirm nor deny the protests or the ensuing crackdown.",
      "But it said: \"China is a country governed by the rule of law, and strictly safeguards citizens' rights to lawfully express their concerns and provide opinions or suggestions.\"",
      "The protests, followed by the crackdown, took place in a territory home to Tibetans in Sichuan province. For years, Chinese authorities have been planning to build the massive Gangtuo dam and hydropower plant, also known as Kamtok in Tibetan, in the valley straddling the Dege (Derge) and Jiangda (Jomda) counties.",
      "Once built, the dam's reservoir would submerge an area that is culturally and religiously significant to Tibetans, and home to several villages and ancient monasteries containing sacred relics.",
      "One of them, the 700-year-old Wangdui (Wontoe) Monastery, has particular historical value as its walls feature rare Buddhist murals.",
      "The Gangtuo dam would also displace thousands of Tibetans. The BBC has seen what appears to be a public tender document for the relocation of 4,287 residents to make way for the dam.",
      "The BBC contacted an official listed on the tender document as well as Huadian, the state-owned enterprise reportedly building the dam. Neither have responded.",
      "Plans to build the dam were first approved in 2012, according to a United Nations special rapporteurs letter to the Chinese government. The letter, which is from July 2024, raised concerns about the dam's \"irreversible impact\" on thousands of people and the environment.",
      "From the start, residents were not \"consulted in a meaningful way\" about the dam, according to the letter. For instance, they were given information that was inadequate and not in the Tibetan language.",
      "They were also promised by the government that the project would only go ahead if 80% of them agreed to it, but \"there is no evidence this consent was ever given,\" the letter goes on to say, adding that residents tried to raise concerns about the dam several times.",
      "Chinese authorities, however, denied this in their response to the UN. \"The relocation of the villages in question was carried out only after full consultation of the opinions of the local residents,\" the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations office said in a letter from September 2024.",
      "It added: \"Local government and project developers funded the construction of new homes and provided subsidies for grazing, herding and farming. As for any cultural relics, they were relocated in their entirety.\"",
      "But the BBC understands from two Tibetan sources that, in February, officials had told them they would be evicted imminently, while giving them little information about resettlement options and compensation.",
      "This triggered such deep anxiety that villagers and Buddhist monks decided to stage protests, despite knowing the risks of a crackdown.",
      "'They didn't know what was going to happen to them'",
      "The largest one saw hundreds gathering outside a government building in Dege. In a video clip obtained and verified by the BBC, protesters can be heard calling on authorities to stop the evictions and let them stay.",
      "Separately, a group of residents approached visiting officials and pleaded with them to cancel plans to build the dam. The BBC has obtained footage which appears to show this incident, and verified it took place in the village of Xiba.",
      "The clip shows red-robed monks and villagers kneeling on a dusty road and showing a thumbs-up, a traditional Tibetan way of begging for mercy.",
      "In the past the Chinese government has been quick to stamp out resistance to authority, especially in Tibetan territory where it is sensitive to anything that could potentially feed separatist sentiment.",
      "It was no different this time. Authorities swiftly launched their crackdown, arresting hundreds of people at protests while also raiding homes across the valley, according to one of our sources.",
      "One unverified but widely shared clip appears to show Chinese policemen shoving a group of monks on a road, in what is thought to be an arrest operation.",
      "Many were detained for weeks and some were beaten badly, according to our Tibetan sources whose family and friends were targeted in the crackdown.",
      "One source shared fresh details of the interrogations. He told the BBC that a childhood friend was detained and interrogated over several days.",
      "\"He was asked questions and treated nicely at first. They asked him 'who asked you to participate, who is behind this'.",
      "\"Then, when he couldn't give them [the] answers they wanted, he was beaten by six or seven different security personnel over several days.\"",
      "His friend sustained only minor injuries, and was freed within a few days. But others were not so lucky.",
      "Another source told the BBC that more than 20 of his relatives and friends were detained for participating in the protests, including an elderly person who was more than 70 years old.",
      "\"Some of them sustained injuries all over their body, including in their ribs and kidneys, from being kicked and beaten\u2026 some of them were sick because of their injuries,\" he said.",
      "Similar claims of physical abuse and beatings during the arrests have surfaced in overseas Tibetan media reports.",
      "The UN letter also notes reports of detentions and use of force on hundreds of protesters, stating they were \"severely beaten by the Chinese police, resulting in injuries that required hospitalisation\".",
      "After the crackdown, Tibetans in the area encountered even tighter restrictions, the BBC understands. Communication with the outside world was further limited and there was increased surveillance. Those who are still contactable have been unwilling to talk as they fear another crackdown, according to sources.",
      "The first source said while some released protesters were eventually allowed to travel elsewhere in Tibetan territory, others have been slapped with orders restricting their movement.",
      "This has caused problems for those who need to go to hospital for medical treatment and nomadic tribespeople who need to roam across pastures with their herds, he said.",
      "The second source said he last heard from his relatives and friends at the end of February: \"When I got through, they said not to call any more as they would get arrested. They were very scared, they would hang up on me.",
      "\"We used to talk over WeChat, but now that is not possible. I'm totally blocked from contacting all of them,\" he said.",
      "\"The last person I spoke to was a younger female cousin. She said, 'It's very dangerous, a lot of us have been arrested, there's a lot of trouble, they have hit a lot of us'\u2026 They didn't know what was going to happen to them next.\"",
      "The BBC has been unable to find any mention of the protests and crackdown in Chinese state media. But shortly after the protests, a Chinese Communist Party official visited the area to \"explain the necessity\" of building the dam and called for \"stability maintenance measures\", according to one report.",
      "A few months later, a tender was awarded for the construction of a Dege \"public security post\", according to documents posted online.",
      "The letter from Chinese authorities to the UN suggests villagers have already been relocated and relics moved, but it is unclear how far the project has progressed.",
      "The BBC has been monitoring the valley via satellite imagery for months. For now, there is no sign of the dam's construction nor demolition of the villages and monasteries.",
      "The Chinese embassy told us authorities were still conducting geological surveys and specialised studies to build the dam. They added the local government is \"actively and thoroughly understanding the demands and aspirations\" of residents.",
      "Development or exploitation?",
      "China is no stranger to controversy when it comes to dams.",
      "When the government constructed the world's biggest dam in the 90s - the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River - it saw protests and criticism over its handling of relocation and compensation for thousands of villagers.",
      "In more recent years, as China has accelerated its pivot from coal to clean energy sources, such moves have become especially sensitive in Tibetan territories.",
      "Beijing has been eyeing the steep valleys and mighty rivers here, in the rural west, to build mega-dams and hydropower stations that can sustain China's electricity-hungry eastern metropolises. President Xi Jinping has personally pushed for this, a policy called \"xidiandongsong\", or \"sending western electricity eastwards\".",
      "Like Gangtuo, many of these dams are on the Jinsha (Dri Chu) river, which runs through Tibetan territories. It forms the upper reaches of the Yangtze river and is part of what China calls the world's largest clean energy corridor.",
      "Gangtuo is in fact the latest in a series of 13 dams planned for this valley, five of which are already in operation or under construction.",
      "The Chinese government and state media have presented these dams as a win-win solution that cuts pollution and generates clean energy, while uplifting rural Tibetans.",
      "In its statement to the BBC, the Chinese embassy said clean energy projects focus on \"promoting high-quality economic development\" and \"enhancing the sense of gain and happiness among people of all ethnic groups\".",
      "But the Chinese government has long been accused of violating Tibetans' rights. Activists say the dams are the latest example of Beijing's exploitation of Tibetans and their land.",
      "\"What we are seeing is the accelerated destruction of Tibetan religious, cultural and linguistic heritage,\" said Tenzin Choekyi, a researcher with rights group Tibet Watch. \"This is the 'high-quality development' and 'ecological civilisation' that the Chinese government is implementing in Tibet.\"",
      "One key issue is China's relocation policy that evicts Tibetans from their homes to make way for development - it is what drove the protests by villagers and monks living near the Gangtuo dam. More than 930,000 rural Tibetans are estimated to have been relocated since 2000, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).",
      "Beijing has always maintained that these relocations happen only with the consent of Tibetans, and that they are given housing, compensation and new job opportunities. State media often portrays it as an improvement in their living conditions.",
      "But rights groups paint a different picture, with reports detailing evidence of coercion, complaints of inadequate compensation, cramped living conditions, and lack of jobs. They also point out that relocation severs the deep, centuries-old connection that rural Tibetans share with their land.",
      "\"These people will essentially lose everything they own, their livelihoods and community heritage,\" said Maya Wang, interim China director at HRW.",
      "There are also environmental concerns over the flooding of Tibetan valleys renowned for their biodiversity, and the possible dangers of building dams in a region rife with earthquake fault lines.",
      "Some Chinese academics have found the pressure from accumulated water in dam reservoirs could potentially increase the risk of quakes, including in the Jinsha river. This could cause catastrophic flooding and destruction, as seen in 2018, when rain-induced landslides occurred at a village situated between two dam construction sites on Jinsha.",
      "The Chinese embassy told us that the implementation of any clean energy project \"will go through scientific planning and rigorous demonstration, and will be subject to relevant supervision\".",
      "In recent years, China has passed laws safeguarding the environment surrounding the Yangtze River and the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. President Xi has personally stressed the need to protect the Yangtze's upper reaches.",
      "About 424 million yuan (\u00a345.5m, $60m) has been spent on environmental conservation along Jinsha, according to state media. Reports have also highlighted efforts to quake-proof dam projects.",
      "Multiple Tibetan rights groups, however, argue that any large-scale development in Tibetan territory, including dams such as Gangtuo, should be halted.",
      "They have staged protests overseas and called for an international moratorium, arguing that companies participating in such projects would be \"allowing the Chinese government to profit from the occupation and oppression of Tibetans\".",
      "\"I really hope that this [dam-building] stops,\" one of our sources said. \"Our ancestors were here, our temples are here. We have been here for generations. It is very painful to move. What kind of life would we have if we leave?\"",
      "Additional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown of BBC Verify",
      "UPDATE: This story has been updated to include China's response to the UN about the Gangtuo dam in a letter dated 12 September 2024."

      "Buildings are rundown and in need of repairs.",
      "This area is dominated by people from Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of Syria's biggest religious minorities.",
      "Alawites controlled power in the predominantly Sunni Muslim country for the 50 years of the Assad family's rule, holding top positions in the government, military and intelligence services.",
      "Now, many from the community fear reprisals following the overthrow of the Assad regime by rebels led by HTS, a Sunni Islamist group that was once al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.",
      "Dozens of Alawites who we had contacted by phone had refused to speak to us, with many saying they were scared.",
      "In Mezzeh 86, the presence of HTS fighters at a checkpoint did not appear to be a source of anxiety.",
      "Many Alawites did come up and speak with us - keen to distance themselves from Assad's regime.",
      "\"During the Assad regime, the stereotype about the Alawites is that they got all the work opportunities and that they are wealthy. But, in fact, most Alawites are poor and you'll only find one among a thousand who is rich,\" said Mohammad Shaheen, a 26-year-old pharmacy student.",
      "\"Even when HTS went to Alawite villages near the coast, they found all villages were poor. Only the Assad family amassed wealth,\" he added, referring to the Alawite heartland in the country's west.",
      "Hasan Dawood, a shopkeeper, chimed in: \"We were slaves for him - drivers, cooks and cleaners.\"",
      "There's also a sense of betrayal.",
      "\"Bashar was a traitor. And the way he fled was cowardly. He should have at least addressed people and told us what was happening. He left without a word, which made the situation chaotic,\" said Mohammad.",
      "But people from the Alawite community, and indeed from this neighbourhood, did serve in Assad's brutal security forces. Do they fear reprisals against them, we asked.",
      "\"Those who were in the military and did bad things have fled. No-one knows where they are. They are afraid of revenge,\" said Thaier Shaheen, a construction worker.",
      "\"But people who don't have blood on their hands, they are not scared, and have stayed back.\"",
      "There have been reports of a few reprisal killings in parts of the country, but so far there is no evidence to suggest they were carried out by HTS.",
      "\"Until now, we are OK. We are talking to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and they are respectful. But there are people who aren't from HTS but pretend to be them who are making threats. They want our society to fail and they are the ones we are scared of,\" said Mohammad.",
      "After taking control of Damascus, HTS and its allies said those from the deposed regime who had been involved in torture and killings would be held to account, although it is unclear so far what form that justice will take.",
      "HTS also said that the rights and freedoms of religious and ethnic minorities would be protected.",
      "The group has a jihadist past which it has distanced itself from. But it has an Islamist present, and many are asking what that will mean for Syria's plural society.",
      "\"I'm so happy because the Assad regime fell. This is like a dream come true. No-one wants to live under dictatorship. But there is concern. I have to be realistic,\" said Youssef Sabbagh, a Christian lawyer.",
      "\"HTS are here now, and they are an Islamic militia. That's what they are. I wish, I pray they will be a modern Islamic militia.\"",
      "\"I speak not just as a Christian, a lot of Syrians, Muslims and everyone, we don't want Syria to become another Afghanistan, we don't want to become a new Libya. We have already suffered a lot.\"",
      "Syria's Christian community is one of the oldest in the world, with the country home to some renowned holy sites.",
      "When the uprising against Assad began in 2011, Christians were initially cautious about taking sides, but eventually members from the community fought on both sides of the conflict.",
      "In the past week, the Archbishop of Homs, Jacques Murad, told the BBC there had already been three meetings with HTS, and they had been able to express their views and concerns honestly.",
      "So far, the signs are re-assuring for many Christians.",
      "Bars and restaurants serving alcohol are open in the Christian quarter of Old Damascus and in other parts of the city. Christmas decorations are also up in many places.",
      "At a restaurant in the Old City, we met lawyer Ouday al-Khayat, who is a Shia Muslim.",
      "\"There's no doubt that there's anticipation and anxiety. The signs that come from HTS are good, but we must wait and watch,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not possible to know the opinions of all Shia but there is a concern about a scenario similar to Libya or Iraq. I believe, though, that Syria is different. Syrian society has been diverse for a very long time.\"",
      "We drove around 110km (70 miles) south-east of Damascus, through black volcanic hills, to the city of Suweida, which is home to most of Syria's Druze population.",
      "The Druze faith is another offshoot of Shia Islam, but has its own unique identity and beliefs.",
      "Many Druze were loyal to the Assad regime, who they believed would protect minorities.",
      "But opposition grew steadily during the war, and there were frequent protests in recent years.",
      "The latest started in Suweida's central square in August 2023 and continued until the day the regime fell.",
      "Activist Wajiha al-Hajjar believes that the protests were not brutally cracked down on like others in Syria, because Assad wanted to show the world and his foreign allies that he was protecting minorities.",
      "\"They did try to suppress our protest but in a different way - not through weapons or shelling, but by depriving us of passports and civil rights, and access to official documents. It became difficult to leave Suweida and a kind of siege was imposed,\" she said.",
      "Hundreds still gather at the square every day. When we visited, there was an air of celebration. Songs were blaring on a loudspeaker, and young girls and boys were doing a gymnastics performance, their families clapping and cheering for them.",
      "\"We are celebrating the fall of the regime, but this gathering is also a show of strength. In the event that there is an extreme regime with extreme laws, we are prepared to stay in this square and demand our rights and demand equality,\" Wajiha said.",
      "Suweida had a quasi-autonomous status under Assad, and the Druze want that to continue.",
      "It is just one example of the diversity and complexity of Syrian society, and the challenges facing the country's new government.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:00:24 GMT",
    "summary": "As the longest serving G7 leader, the Canadian prime minister has weathered many storms. But this time might be different.",
    "story": [
      "It was one of the worst weeks of his political career, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ringing in the season.",
      "At the Liberal Party's annual holiday gathering, Trudeau put on his party face, despite being blindsided the day before by the snap resignation of one of his most trusted allies, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, just hours before she was due to deliver an economic statement in Parliament.",
      "But even as some members of his own party were calling on him to leave, the prime minister struck a resolute, defiant tone as he addressed the party faithful in his dark blue suit and tie.",
      "He alluded to his \"difficult\" week, comparing it to a family fight.",
      "He discussed being \"audacious\" and \"ambitious\" in the face of adversity, and made pointed digs at his political rival, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada.",
      "Pundits remarked afterwards that it sounded a lot like a campaign speech, and that despite the latest political turmoil, Trudeau appears to be digging in.",
      "That stance did not change on Friday, even after the leader of the country's progressive New Democrat Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh said he would introduce a motion to topple Trudeau's government in the new year. It was the support of the NDP that had kept the Liberals in power. An election now appears imminent.",
      "Yet Trudeau has so far given no indication that he will resign soon, though he reportedly told fellow party members that he would take time over the winter holiday to think about what to do.",
      "Political observers say Trudeau has often shown a streak of defiance when he is under pressure, something that has helped him weather a number of controversies in his nine years in power.",
      "And he has often been underestimated, such as when he won a majority government in 2015 at the age of 44, despite being portrayed by his political opponents as something of a dilettante.",
      "But as pressure mounts on him to resign, some of those same experts say he may need a new strategy.",
      "Proving his doubters wrong",
      "When Trudeau first ran for prime minister, three words followed him around: Just not ready.",
      "That phrase was the tagline of an attack ad played repeatedly throughout the country as he tried to unseat the incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative who had been in power since 2006.",
      "It conveyed common criticisms he faced at the time about his young age, his relative lack of experience and his winding path to politics.",
      "Trudeau \"sort of meandered around\" in his early life before becoming a drama teacher in Vancouver, said Canadian historian Raymond Blake, seemingly insulated as the well-known and wealthy son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.",
      "But not long after entering politics, Trudeau adopted a fighting stance.",
      "It is a trait that some say he learned from his father, who was known for his charismatic yet combative leadership style, and who is famous for his catchphrase of \"just watch me,\" which he glibly told a reporter at the height of a political crisis.",
      "\"His father had an image of really being a resilient, very tough politician,\" said Lawrence Martin, a long-time Canadian political columnist based in Washington DC.",
      "The younger Trudeau went on to defy the odds himself by pulling off a historic win for his Liberal party, taking them from third-place in parliament to a majority mandate in his first federal election.",
      "\"This kind of makes him feel that he can overcome big obstacles,\" said Mr Martin, adding that, politically, Trudeau operates with \"a hyper amount of self-confidence\".",
      "Trudeau's path to power turned bumpy once he had assumed office, after he became involved in a number of political scandals.",
      "In his first term, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould - the first indigenous woman to hold the job - quit over what she described as attempts at interference and \"veiled threats\" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.",
      "As he vied for a second term in 2019, Trudeau's re-election campaign was rocked by images that were released showing him as a younger man donning brown face on at least three occasions.",
      "And a year later, in 2020, Trudeau faced yet another ethics scandal involving a potentially large government contract for a youth charity that had worked with Trudeau family members.",
      "But in the face of every setback, Trudeau held on to power. He won re-election twice, making him the longest-serving leader of his G7 peers.",
      "\"Trudeau has survived so much,\" Prof Blake said, noting that his political successes and leadership have won the loyalty of many in his party despite the scandals.",
      "Is Freeland's exit a turning point?",
      "While Trudeau has weathered many storms, there are signs that his time may be up.",
      "For one, history is not on his side. Only two Canadian prime ministers - Sir John A MacDonald and Wilfrid Laurier - served four consecutive terms.",
      "Trudeau is also working against a sinking popularity. A September poll from Ipsos suggested around two-thirds of Canadians disapprove of him. Just 26% of respondents said Trudeau was their top pick for prime minister, putting him 19 points behind Conservative leader Poilievre.",
      "And then there's the slowly dwindling support within Trudeau's own party. So far, at least 18 Liberal MPs have called for their leader to step down.",
      "\"He's delusional if he thinks we can continue like this,\" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told reporters this week.",
      "\"It's unfair to us MPs, it's unfair to the ministers and most importantly it's unfair to the country. We need to move on with a new direction and we need to reboot.\"",
      "According to Long, who has driven the push to remove Trudeau, as many as 50 of the 153 Liberal MPs want him to quit immediately. Roughly the same number are Trudeau loyalists, he said, and the rest are on the fence.",
      "\"There's still some party loyalists who like him and, you know, want to still support him,\" said Mr Martin, the DC-based columnist. \"But if you had a secret vote of Liberal caucus about whether he should stay on or not, he would be defeated handily.\"",
      "The prime minister is also seemingly driven to stay by his disdain for his political opponent Poilievre, Mr Martin observed.",
      "\"He does not want to back down, and he does want to take on Pierre Poilievre, whom he detests,\" he said.",
      "Trudeau's stubborn perseverance in the face of a dismal political forecast has drawn  comparisons to outgoing US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his candidacy months before the November election only after mounting internal pressure.",
      "Prof Blake said that Trudeau's legacy, like Biden's, will hinge on how he exits. Fighting a losing battle, he said, could give Trudeau \"a lasting scar\". But the prime minister has a remarkable ability to survive, he noted.",
      "\"He's been a survivor, and he hasn't done what's normal. Will normal - whatever it is - fall into place this time? Perhaps, but I'm not convinced.\"",
      "Trudeau's dilemma is also similar to one faced by his father, who won three elections in a row, and went on to win a fourth after leaving power for less than a year.",
      "But by 1984, more than 15 years after first becoming prime minister, the elder Trudeau - like his son now - faced dire polls. It seemed clear he would not win the next election if he stayed on. He decided to step down, telling the public that he made the decision after taking a walk in an Ottawa snowstorm.",
      "Since then, the term \"walk in the snow\" has become synonymous with political resignation in Canada. This Christmas, it remains to be seen whether Trudeau will take his own walk.",

      "In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted - ending Japan's longest running legal saga.",
      "Mr Hakamata's case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japan's justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.",
      "Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners' risk of developing a serious mental illness.",
      "And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didn't commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.",
      "Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hideko's close care.",
      "When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in \"his own world\" for years.",

      "\"We had no idea what was going on,\" Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.",
      "The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.",
      "He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.",
      "Two years after his arrest, Mr\u202fHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.",
      "One prison visit in particular stands out.",
      "\"He told me, 'there was an execution yesterday - it was a person in the next cell',\" she recalls. \"He told me to take care - and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.\"",

      "\"Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution,\" Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.",
      "\"You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you don't know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.\"",
      "James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that \"the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading\". The report concluded that inmates were at risk of \"significant mental health issues\".",
      "Hideko could only watch as her own brother's mental health deteriorated as the years went by.",
      "\"Once he asked me 'Do you know who I am?' I said, 'Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata'. 'No,' he said, 'you must be here to see a different person'. And he just went back [to his cell].\"",
      "Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasn't until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.",
      "A key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.",
      "They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamata's defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his - and alleged that the evidence was planted.",
      "In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.",
      "Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hideko\u202fwho appeared in court, pleading for her brother's life.",
      "Mr Hakamata's fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.",
      "The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered - but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.",
      "That was enough to convince presiding judge\u202fKoshi Kunii, who declared that \"the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place\".",
      "Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.",
      "Hideko's first reaction was to cry.",
      "\"When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears,\" she says. \"I am not a tearful person, but my\u202ftears\u202fjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.\"",
      "Hostage justice",
      "The court's conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.",
      "Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called \"hostage justice\" which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, \"denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning\".",
      "\"These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions,\" Ms Doi noted in 2023.",
      "David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.",
      "He said one reason it dragged on is that \"critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010\".",
      "The failure was \"egregious and inexcusable\", Mr Johnson told the BBC. \"Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.\"",
      "Hideko\u202fsays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.",
      "But Mr Johnson says false accusations don't happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels - from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.",
      "\"Judges have the last word,\" he added. \"When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.\"",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamata's acquittal was a watershed - a rare moment of retrospective justice.",
      "After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised to\u202fHideko\u202ffor how long it took to achieve justice.",
      "A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visited\u202fher\u202fhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.",
      "\"For the past 58 years\u2026 we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden,\" Mr Tsuda said. \"We are truly sorry.\"",
      "Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.",
      "\"We believe that everything that happened was our destiny,\" she said. \"We will not complain about anything now.\"",
      "The pink door",
      "After nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwao\u202falongside family friends and supporters.",
      "Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her \"cute\" little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.",
      "The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.",
      "\"We were always together when we were children,\" she explains. \"I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.\u202f And so, it continues.\"",
      "She walks into Mr Hakamata's room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.",
      "\"He wanted to become a champion,\" she says. \"Then the incident happened.\"",
      "After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.",
      "\"I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.\"",
      "It's the first thing one notices when visiting Hideko's apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.",
      "It's unclear whether it has worked \u2013 Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.",
      "But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.",
      "When asked who she blames for her brother's suffering, she replies: \"no-one\".",
      "\"Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.\"",
      "Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.",
      "Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brother's freedom, says this was their fate.",
      "\"I don't want to think about the past. I don't know how long I'm going to live,\" she says. \"I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 01:13:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Brazilian narco gangs say they are taking territory for Jesus, and are barring other faiths from the favelas.",
    "story": [
      "When police in Rio de Janeiro seize blocks of cocaine and bundles of marijuana they may well find them branded with a religious symbol \u2013 the Star of David. This is not a reference to the Jewish faith, but to the belief of some Pentecostal Christians that the return of Jews to Israel will lead to the Second Coming of Christ.",
      "The gang selling these branded drugs is the Pure Third Command, one of Rio's most powerful criminal groups, with a reputation both for making its opponents disappear, and for fanatical evangelical Christianity.",
      "They took control of a group of five favelas in the north of the city \u2013 now known as the Israel Complex \u2013 after one of their leaders had what he believed was a revelation from God, says theologian Vivian Costa, author of the book, Evangelical Drug Dealers.",
      "She says the gangsters see themselves as \"soldiers of crime\", with Jesus as \"the owner\" of the territory they dominate.",
      "Controversially, some have dubbed them \"Narco-Pentecostals\".",
      "A rifle and the Bible",
      "One man who has experience of crime and religion \u2013 though in his case, not at the same time \u2013 is Pastor Diego Nascimento, who became a Christian after hearing the gospel from a gangster holding a gun.",
      "Looking at him, it's hard to believe that this boyish looking 42-year-old Wesleyan Methodist minister with a ready smile and dimples, was once a member of Rio's notorious Red Command crime gang and managed its activities in the city's Vila Kennedy favela.",
      "Four years in prison for drug dealing weren't enough to make him give up crime. But when he became addicted to crack cocaine his standing in the gang plummeted.",
      "\"I lost my family. I practically lived on the street for almost a year. I went so far as to sell things from my house to buy crack,\" he says.",
      "It was at that point, when he was at rock bottom, that a well-known drug dealer in the favela summoned him.",
      "\"He started preaching to me, saying there was a way out, that there was a solution for me, which was to accept Jesus,\" he recalls.",
      "The young addict took this advice and began his journey to the pulpit.",
      "Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself.",
      "Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms.",
      "\"I don't see them as evangelical believers,\" he says.",
      "\"I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives.",
      "\"There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer.\"",
      "'Living under siege'",
      "Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade.",
      "As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power.",
      "One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths.",
      "Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living \"under siege\" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion.",
      "\"In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory.\"",
      "Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as \"Jesus is the Lord of this place.\"",
      "Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them.",
      "But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact.",
      "\"These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates.\"",
      "She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela.",
      "'Neo-crusade'",
      "While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has \"increased dramatically\" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall.",
      "Jagun, who is a babalorix\u00e1 (high priest) of the Candombl\u00e9 religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities.",
      "\"This is a form of neo-Crusade,\" he says. \"The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God.\"",
      "But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints.",
      "\"If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] \u00d2g\u00fan, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings.",
      "\"That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'.\"",
      "Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution \u2013 that of religious freedom.",
      "And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule."

    "title": "Five unanswered questions from the Pelicot trial",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 01:49:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Although the Pelicot trial is over, some questions remain over the case that shook France.",
    "story": [
      "French rape survivor Gis\u00e8le Pelicot walked out of a court in southern France for  the last time on Thursday after her ex-husband was  jailed for 20 years for drugging and raping her, and inviting dozens of strangers to also abuse her over nearly a decade.",
      "Dominique Pelicot, 72, was found guilty of all charges by a judge in Avignon. He was on trial with 50 other men, all of whom were found guilty of at least one charge, although their jail terms were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Although the trial is over, there are still questions lingering over the Pelicot case and what happens next.",
      "1. What will Gis\u00e8le Pelicot do now?",
      "When she climbed the steps of the Avignon courthouse for the first time in September, no one knew Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's name. Over the course of the next 15 weeks, her fame as a rape victim who refused to be ashamed of what had been done to her grew vertiginously.",
      "By the time she left the tribunal on Thursday, crowds of hundreds were chanting her name and her picture was on the front pages of newspapers worldwide.",
      "She is now perhaps one of the best-known women in France. This means that although she has stopped using her husband's surname, it will be impossible for her to return to the anonymity that served her so well as she tried to rebuild a life following the revelation of her husband's crimes.",
      "Gis\u00e8le is not the first person whose unimaginable suffering has turned her into an icon. At great personal cost, she has become the symbol of a fight she never chose. It seems unlikely, then, that she will want to become an outspoken activist against gender violence, or a prominent feminist figure. Rather, she may go back to what she has said has always given her solace: music, long walks and chocolate \u2013 as well as her seven grandchildren.",
      "\"At the start of the trial she said: 'If I last two weeks, that will be a lot.' In the end, she made it to three and a half months,\" her lawyer Stephane Babonneau said. \"Now, she is at peace, and relieved it's all over.\"",
      "2. What really happened to Caroline?",
      "Days after Dominique Pelicot's crimes came to light, his daughter Caroline Darian was summoned to the police station and shown photos of an apparently unconscious woman dressed in unfamiliar lingerie. Later, she said her life had \"stopped\" when she realised she was looking at photos of herself.",
      "Her father has always denied touching her, but Caroline \u2013 whose anguish and devastation were apparent in many court sessions \u2013 has said she would never believe him and accused him of looking at her \"with incestuous eyes\".",
      "But the lack of proof of the abuse Caroline is convinced was inflicted on her has led her to say she is \"the forgotten victim\" of the trial. That notion has visibly seeped into her relationship with her mother. In her memoir \u2013 published after her father's arrest \u2013 she accused Gis\u00e8le of not showing her enough support, implicitly choosing to side with her rapist ex-husband over her daughter.",
      "Although Gis\u00e8le and her children have always sat next to one another in court, often whispering huddled together, there have been signs of the toll the trial has taken on their relationship.",
      "On Friday, Caroline's brother David highlighted \u2013 as he has done before \u2013 that the trial had not just been about Gis\u00e8le but about their whole \"annihilated family\".",
      "\"Us children felt forgotten,\" he said. \"Very honestly I feel that while our lawyers did a remarkable job on the defence of our mother, we were a little bit less taken into account.\"",
      "In her memoir, Caroline lamented Gis\u00e8le's \"denial as a coping mechanism\".",
      "\"Because of my father,\" she wrote, \"I am now losing my mother.\"",
      "3. How many defendants will appeal?",
      "Apart from Dominique, all of the jail terms handed down to the defendants were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Several defence lawyers were visibly satisfied, meaning it is unlikely they will encourage their clients to appeal against their sentences. A man called Jean-Pierre Mar\u00e9chal got 12 years \u2013 five less than prosecutors had asked \u2013 and his lawyer Patrick Gontard told the BBC it was \"out of the question\" he would appeal.",
      "The months or years the men spent in pre-trial detention will count towards their total sentences, meaning that some may be freed soon if they have served their minimum term.",
      "One man who was facing 17 years ended up being sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, and his lawyer Roland Marmillot told the BBC that because he had already spent several years in jail it was likely he would be released relatively soon.",
      "Still, by the morning after the trial closed, two men each jailed for eight years had already appealed. More are expected to follow over the next ten days \u2013 the period of time appeals can be lodged for.",
      "4. What else could Dominique Pelicot be guilty of?",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted to assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris in 1999. A cloth imbued with ether was put over her mouth but she managed to fight the attacker off and he fled. It was only in 2021, after he was arrested for the crimes he inflicted on his wife Gis\u00e8le, that Pelicot's DNA was cross-checked with a speck of blood found on Marion's shoe, and he admitted to his guilt.",
      "He has, however, denied any responsibility in another cold case \u2013 the 1991 rape and murder of another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, for which there is no DNA. Investigators have argued that the two cases present too many similarities to be coincidental.",
      "Other cold cases where similar modi operandi were used are also being looked at again.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "5. Will the trial be a turning point?",
      "\"There will be a 'before' and there will be an 'after' the Pelicot trial,\" one Parisian man told the BBC in the early days of the trial.",
      "For many, this sentiment has only grown over the last few months during which the intense media coverage of the Pelicot trial generated countless conversations around rape, consent and gender violence.",
      "\"What we need to do is have much, much harsher sentences,\" Nicolas and Mehdi, two residents of Mazan - the village where the Pelicots lived - told the BBC. They said they were \"disgusted\" when they found out one of the defendants was a man they had played football with.",
      "\"With longer sentences they'll at least they'll think twice before doing stuff like this,\" they said, adding that it was \"crazy unfair\" that some of the men could come out of jail in the next few months.",
      "It is worth noting, however, that the risk of incurring a 20-year prison sentence for aggravated rape did not deter Dominique Pelicot from offering his unconscious wife to be raped by strangers he met online.",
      "There have been calls to reform French legislation on rape to include consent, but that has stalled in the past and would take considerable work in the current divided French parliament.",
      "Some have argued that schools have a responsibility to better teach new generations about sex, love and consent. B\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, has said she believes \"change will not come from the ministry of justice but from the ministry of education\".",
      "Fran\u00e7oise, a resident of the area where Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot used to live, told the BBC she thinks a way must be found to bridge the gap between what children are taught in schools and the type of material they have access to online.",
      "\"Young people are so exposed to sex on the internet and at the same time schools are very prudish,\" she said. \"They should be much more open and frank to match and explain what kids see.\"",
      "What these exchanges show is that, while it will take time before any changes become tangible, a conversation has now started. It will continue until there are no more unanswered questions.",

    "summary": "Army defectors say units sent to fight against Ukraine will have high morale but won't be battle hardened.",
    "story": [
      "What Haneul remembers most about his time in the North Korean military is the gnawing, continuous hunger. He lost 10kg in his first month of service, due to a diet of cracked corn and mouldy cabbage.",
      "Three months into training, he says almost his entire battalion was severely malnourished and needed to be sent to a recovery centre to gain weight.",
      "When they were later deployed as front-line guards to the border with South Korea, rice replaced corn. But by the time it reached their bowls, much had been siphoned off by rear units, and the remainder had been cut with sand.",
      "Haneul says his unit was among the best-fed, a tactic to stop them defecting to South Korea. But it failed to prevent Haneul.",
      "In 2012, he made a death-defying dash across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) \u2013 the strip of land dividing the North from the South.",
      "His experience and that of other military defectors helps shed light on the condition of thousands of North Korean troops deployed to the front line in Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Pyongyang has reportedly sent around 11,000 troops to help Russian forces reclaim part of its Kursk region taken by Ukraine in a surprise summer offensive.",
      "Earlier this week, Seoul, Washington and Kyiv said the soldiers had now entered the fight \"in significant numbers\", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed.",
      "However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, most belong to the elite Storm Corps unit, and have \"high morale\", but \"lack an understanding of contemporary warfare\".",
      "Only the taller, sportier men are selected for the Storm Corps, says defector Lee Hyun Seung, who trained North Korea's special forces in the early 2000s before defecting in 2014.",
      "He taught them martial arts, how to throw knives and make weapons out of cutlery and other kitchen utensils.",
      "But even though the Storm Corps' training is more advanced than that of regular North Korean units, the soldiers are still underfed and even malnourished.",
      "Online videos, reportedly of the troops in Russia, show younger, \"frail\" soldiers, Haneul says. They are a stark contrast to Pyongyang's propaganda videos, where men are seen bursting out of iron chains and smashing blocks of ice with their bare hands.",
      "During his entire time in the army, Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session.",
      "The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables. Haneul says he ignored instructions to \"shoot any intruders\" and let the man go with a warning.",
      "It is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea. It appears that the country's leader Kim Jong Un has directed much of his limited resources into missiles and nuclear weapons rather than his standing army.",
      "But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are \"incredibly tough\", even for the special forces. The 28-year-old, who worked as a driver in the air force for seven years, says that during his service, conditions deteriorated and rice gradually disappeared from meals.",
      "\"The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.\"",
      "Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk.",
      "Crucially, the Storm Corps are not a front-line unit. \"Their mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and create chaos deep within enemy territory,\" Ryu says.",
      "But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood.",
      "\"Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.\"",
      "The language barrier seems to have created an additional hurdle. On Sunday, Ukraine's defence intelligence unit said communication issues had resulted in North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight.",
      "With these assessments, it could be easy to dismiss the troops as \"cannon fodder\" and a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's desperation. But that would be a mistake, the defectors say. Their loyalty to the regime and fighting spirit will count for a lot.",
      "\"Most of the soldiers in the Storm Corps come from working-class or farming families, who are highly obedient to the party and will follow orders unquestionably,\" says Haneul, whose father and cousin were in the special forces.",
      "Intense, ideological \"brainwashing\" sessions, held every morning, will further ensure they are mentally ready, Lee adds.  He believes the North Korean troops \"will become accustomed to the battlefield, learn how to fight the enemy, and find ways to survive\".",
      "At least 100 North Koreans dead in Ukraine war, says South",
      "What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's war",
      "Although the soldiers will not have been given a choice over whether to be deployed, Ryu thinks many will have wanted to go. The ambitious will see it as an opportunity to advance their careers, he says.",
      "And given how tough it is to serve in North Korea, some will have relished the chance to experience life abroad for the first time.",
      "\"I think they'll be more willing to fight than Russian troops,\" he adds, admitting that in their situation, he too would have wanted to be sent.",
      "Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces, agrees with the defectors' appraisals. \"Just because they lack food and training, does not mean they are incapable. They will acclimatise quickly. We should not underestimate them.\"",
      "While 11,000 troops are unlikely to turn the tide of such an attritional war \u2013 it is estimated Russia is suffering more than a thousand casualties a day \u2013 experts and officials believe this could be just the first tranche, with Pyongyang potentially able to send up to 60,000 or even 100,000 if they are rotated.",
      "In these numbers, Mr Chun believes they could end up being effective.",
      "Also, Kim Jong Un will be able to shoulder big losses without affecting the stability of his regime, the former soldiers say.",

    "title": "Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:56:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-husband - who is under investigation for other attacks - has a divided personality, a doctor finds.",
    "story": [
      "It was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his \"\u00e9lan\" - as the French might put it - that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd.",
      "There he stood. A 68-year-old pensioner who had already spent several months inside one of France's most notorious prisons, Les Baumettes in Marseilles. The prison was a grim, intimidating place, crowded with members of the port city's warring drug gangs.",
      "And yet the man in the visiting room who rose to greet Dr Laurent Layet on a cold day in February 2021 seemed \"clean, polished\u2026 He had just cut his own hair. He came towards me with this assertive attitude.\" Dr Layet was surprised, to put it mildly.",
      "The psychiatrist was the first of many people to scrutinise Dominique Pelicot. Each expert was looking for clues to explain how this apparently genial pensioner could have committed such grotesque crimes and deceived his unsuspecting victim for so long.",
      "In all his years interviewing hundreds of rapists and suspected rapists on behalf of French police and prosecutors, Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom.",
      "\"Something didn't fit. I had never encountered such an exceptional case,\" Dr Layet remembers thinking at the time.",
      "At the end of a gruelling, four-month trial that has enraged people across France and far beyond - even as they were inspired by the dignity and courage of Gisele - Dominique Pelicot's confident demeanour, a grandiose presence in the courtroom in Avignon, remained intact.",
      "One might expect a man in Pelicot's position - a globally reviled sexual predator, and rapist, facing the near-certain prospect of dying in prison - to cut a wretched figure. And there have been a handful of brief moments when he wept, openly, in court - usually for himself.",
      "But for the most part, he struck an imperious pose, courtroom microphone in one hand, his body slouched in a throne-like chair (to accommodate the accused's health issues), sometimes looking bored, occasionally interjecting like a ringmaster seeking to keep an unruly circus - the 50 other men on trial beside him - in their place.",
      "\"I am a rapist, like the others in this room. They knew everything,\" he intoned, speaking with the confidence of a man who assumed his words would put an end to all further discussion.",
      "But what are we to make of that domineering performance? And what have we really learned of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife?",
      "Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket. Called in to assess Pelicot, Dr Layet noted how breezily he dismissed his crime, like a genteel grandfather caught pocketing a few cigarettes.",
      "Dr Layet detected a \"dissonance\" in the man's behaviour, and the strong implication that he was hiding something more serious. He told the police that this one was worth closer inspection.",
      "In court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges.",
      "A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness. He could not be dismissed as a \"monster\". Nor was he psychotic - unable to tell reality from fiction.",
      "And yet. There was a \"fissure\", a split, in Pelicot's personality.",
      "A showier witness might have borrowed from popular culture to compare him to a tormented Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or perhaps to Hannibal Lecter, stiff-backed in his prison cell in The Silence of the Lambs.",
      "Instead, Dr Layet reached for a mundane image.",
      "\"Almost like a hard drive,\" he suggested. A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Later, in an interview with the BBC at his office in Carpentras, Dr Layet explained that Pelicot's mind had become divided, over time, like a partitioned computer disk, into two entirely separate \"water-tight parts\u2026 with no leakage between them. His split personality is very effective and very solid. We either have the 'normal Mr Pelicot' or the other Mr Pelicot at night, in the bedroom.\"",
      "Asked in court to explain that \"other\" Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities. They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC:",
      "\"Egocentrisme, fragilite narcissique, perturbations emotionnelles\u2026 une deviance paraphilique melant candaulisme, voyeurism et somnophilie.\"",
      "\"Egomania, narcissistic fragility, emotional disorders... an abnormal sexual deviancy combining candaulism [exposing your female partner to others for sexual enjoyment], voyeurism and somnophilia.\"",
      "Pelicot's own defence lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, enthusiastically embraced the \"split\" personality theory in her closing arguments at the trial. She suggested that the charming young man Gisele Pelicot had fallen in love with and quickly married back in 1973 \"was not the man that had harmed her\".",
      "But that is not what Dr Layet - or the other psychiatrists we have consulted for this article - meant.",
      "There may be two sides to Pelicot's behaviour, but there is - to stick with Dr Layet's computing metaphor - only one operating system that controls his cruel, private urges and his public demeanour.",
      "A simpler way of putting it is that Pelicot has an antisocial personality disorder - a term preferred by psychiatrists these days to words such as psychopath or sociopath. Several experts have concluded it is a reasonable diagnosis to use in the context of Pelicot's warped mind.",
      "He is not \"mad\" - he cannot claim diminished responsibility for his actions. But he does show well-established traits of a personality disorder characterised by a lack of empathy towards other humans. Those traits may have been sharpened by the sexual abuse he experienced as a child.",
      "Which brings us to another key question. Did Pelicot only become a rapist in retirement, or was he preying on women long before he began drugging his wife?",
      "Sitting towards the back of the courtroom one Tuesday afternoon late in the trial, surrounded by journalists tapping away on their laptops, Florence Rault looked at Dominique Pelicot with a particularly well-informed sense of disgust.",
      "\"It can be assumed that what happened in Mazan\u2026 is only the culmination of a long process,\" she said later, in a BBC interview.",
      "Ms Rault, a lawyer specialising in criminal cases, knew something deeply troubling about Pelicot - allegations of appalling crimes arguably more disturbing than those for which he was about to be convicted.",
      "For many years, she had been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.",
      "More than 20 years before the rapes for which he has now been sentenced - in 1999 - Pelicot is accused of assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris. She fought the attacker off.",
      "He eventually admitted to being present at the scene in 2021 after DNA - a spot of blood on the victim's shoe - was finally found to match Pelicot's. But he continues to deny he attempted to rape her and the investigation continues.",
      "\"Once he was told that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said 'Yes, it's me,'\" Ms Rault remembered.",
      "And that discovery quickly led to a link to an even older cold case. In 1991, another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, had been raped and murdered. Although crucial DNA evidence had gone missing, the similarities between the scenes were so striking that Pelicot is under investigation for the crime, which he denies. The search for other potential links to older crimes is also ongoing.",
      "If you've been affected by issues of sexual abuse, information and support is available at BBC Action Line.",
      "Ms Rault is not expecting any more confessions from Pelicot in relation to the cold cases.",
      "\"Until he's confronted with indisputable proof, he will deny [everything],\" said Ms Rault, who once sat beside Pelicot at a hearing and was struck, like Dr Layet, by his \"relaxed, rather serene\" demeanour.",
      "Ms Rault now watched him in the Avignon courtroom and saw the same behaviour. She also noted how Pelicot emphatically and tearfully denied drugging and raping his own daughter, Caroline, despite having taken deeply troubling photos of her, asleep, and without her knowledge.",
      "\"She's convinced that he sexually abused her too. But since we don't have any formal evidence like DNA to put in front of him, of course he will continue to deny it,\" said Rault, arguing that, for Caroline, the agony of uncertainty was as cruel and traumatic as the suffering of a victim who knew exactly what had happened to her.",
      "Pelicot's attitude towards his family in court was often revealing. The psychiatrist, Dr Layet, pointed out that the accused narcissistically focused on the love his wife and children once felt for him, not his betrayal of their trust.",
      "For Pelicot, this \"started out as a love story\" and he \"doesn't want this to be ignored\", said Dr Layet.",
      "But Ms Rault had come to court to look for other signs. Above all, she wanted to shore up her sense that Pelicot's crimes were highly premeditated.",
      "\"Serial rapists\u2026 usually have an impulse. They commit rape. They leave, and then they forget. This is not the case with [Pelicot] at all,\" she said.",
      "Ms Rault recalled the methodical actions of Marion's attacker inside an estate agent's office in 1999. The way he had made an excuse to return to his car - almost certainly to collect a rope and a bottle of ether to drug her. Then Ms Rault noted that the man in the glass cage in Avignon demonstrated a similar self-possession and saw it as further evidence that this was a deeply calculating criminal.",
      "\"When he says he has urges and acts on impulse, it's nothing like that. He is very calm.\"",
      "On the same day that Ms Rault was in the Avignon courtroom, I was sitting nearby. Gisele Pelicot was a few metres to our right. Dozens of the accused sat in front of us. Dominique Pelicot was over to the left side of the room.",
      "During a break in proceedings, I walked over to him. According to French law, journalists are not allowed to talk to the accused. Instead, I stood for a while and watched him as he sat in his chair, behind his glass wall, one hand on his stick. Then his head turned towards me, and he held my gaze for what must have been 20 seconds - although it felt much longer.",
      "His expression did not change. He did not seem to blink. And then, like a bored man switching between equally boring television channels, he looked away."

    "summary": "The BBC hears how roofs flew off homes as people sheltered inside in the cyclone-hit French territory.",
    "story": [
      "On the night Cyclone Chido hit the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, Zinedine was in his home, a small house made of corrugated iron and wood where he lives with eight of his relatives.",
      "Zinedine had received a warning from the authorities about the cyclone, but he didn't take it too seriously.",
      "\"I thought it was like in previous years when they warned that a cyclone was coming but it would just be a bit of rain. So we stayed home.\"",
      "This time however the island was about to be hit by winds of more than 124mph (200km/h) - the strongest cyclone to hit the island in almost a century",
      "So far 31 people are known to have died, according to French officials, and thousands more feared missing.",
      "When another, more urgent cyclone warning came through, Zinedine swung into action.",
      "\"I told my mum it's never happened before that they send a message like this so I think this time it's serious.\"",
      "He suggested they go to their neighbours' place, a bricks and mortar house not far from his, in a poor neighbourhood high up in the hills of Mayotte's Petite Terre, the smaller of its two islands.",
      "But his mum didn't want to go, and he felt he had to stay home with his family. The 20-year-old tourism student is the eldest boy in his family and feels responsible for them.",
      "When the storm started, he and his mum hid his younger siblings under a table. Then there was a loud noise.",
      "\"The iron roofing of our house flew off. We panicked and looked for shelter. There were iron sheets, wood and other big objects flying everywhere.\"",
      "He took his siblings to the neighbour's hut when he turned around he noticed his mum hadn't followed.",
      "\"I decided to go back outside to get my mother even though it was dangerous with the wind and everything. I'd rather die than leave my mum to die.\"",
      "His mother stood in the middle of their damaged house holding a one-year-old baby. She was terrified and wouldn't let the baby go. Zinedine snatched him from her arms and ran to give him to the neighbours. He eventually had to carry his mother out of the house.",
      "\"Luckily we're all safe but we've lost everything. The only things we were able to save were our papers and diplomas.\"",
      "Now he's trying to rebuild his family's home. Finding new building materials is incredibly difficult in Mayotte at the moment due to high demand, and he couldn't afford new roofing for his house so he tracked down some of the corrugated iron sheets that were blown off by the storm and plans to re-use them.",
      "\"I'm trying to do what I can. Even though I'm not a builder, I want to do it myself because I don't know if the authorities will help us.\"",
      "All across Mayotte, others like Zinedine are attempting to do the same, the sound of hammers ringing late into the night.",
      "But as resourceful as the people of Mayotte are, they're also angry at the lack of support they say they've received from the government.",
      "During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the islands on Thursday, he was booed whilst trying to make a speech. As he visited a hospital, frustrated staff complained of being overwhelmed.",
      "Most of the people we spoke to when in Mayotte were yet to receive any state aid, five days after the cyclone.",
      "\"We've only received food donations from volunteers who've also given us clothes and water. The mayor's office tried to help a bit but that's it\" says 18-year-old mother-of-three Yasmine Moussa.",
      "She took her three boys, the youngest of whom is just three months old, to the closest shelter, a secondary school in the neighbourhood of Labattoir, shortly after receiving the storm warning on Friday afternoon.",
      "\"On the day of the cyclone my children were crying because of the noise. When we  looked outside we saw corrugated iron roofs flying everywhere. They kept asking me what was happening, why everything was breaking,\" she said.",
      "\"I said to them it's just wind and rain but the next day when they saw everything was destroyed. They couldn't sleep that night.\"",
      "When she headed back home, she could hardly recognise her own neighbourhood.",
      "\"Mango trees had fallen during the storm and were blocking the roads. My neighbour had to point my house out to me because I couldn't even spot it. There was water everywhere, the toilet was broken, my TV, everything was ruined. I tried to save what I could.",
      "\"I was in tears, I never imagined this would happen.\"",
      "Now she has nowhere else to go. She says the conditions in the shelter are decent but she needs a house to take her children to. They now sleep on mattresses in one of the school's classrooms with a dozen other families.",
      "\"It's not normal to sleep like this. The doors don't lock and sometimes strangers walk in. I worry for my children's safety and that they will try to steal from us.\"",
      "The Red Cross told the BBC there are at least 100,000 people in shelters around Mayotte.",

      "The chaos since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad is \"paving the way\" for the so-called Islamic State (IS) to make a comeback, according to a leading Kurdish commander who helped defeat the jihadist group in Syria in 2019. He says the comeback has already begun.",
      "\"Activity by Daesh [IS] has increased significantly, and the danger of a resurgence had doubled', according to General Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mainly Kurdish militia alliance backed by the US. \"They now have more capabilities and more opportunities.\"",
      "He says that IS militants have seized some arms and ammunition left behind by Syrian regime troops, according to intelligence reports.",
      "And he warns there is \"a real threat\" that the militants will try to break into SDF-run prisons here in north-east Syria, which are holding about 10,000 of their men. The SDF is also holding about 50,000 of their family members in camps.",
      "Our interview with the general was late at night, at a location we can't disclose.",
      "He welcomed the fall of the Assad regime - which detained him four times. But he looked weary and admitted to frustration at the prospect of fighting old battles once again.",
      "\"We fought against them [IS] and paid 12,000 souls,\" he said, referring to the SDF's losses. \"I think at some level we will have to go back to where we were before.\"",
      "The risk of an IS resurgence is heightened, he says, because the SDF is coming under increasing attacks from neighbouring Turkey - and rebel factions it supports - and must divert some fighters to that battle.   He tells us the SDF has had to stop counter terrorism operations against IS, and hundreds of prison guards - from a force of thousands - have returned home to defend their villages.",
      "Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the PKK - banned Kurdish separatists who have waged an insurgency for decades, and are classed as terrorists by the US, and the EU. Turkey has long wanted a 30km \"buffer zone\" in the Kurdish region in northeastern Syria. Since Assad's fall, it is pushing harder to get it.",
      "\"The number one threat is now Turkey because its airstrikes are killing our forces,\" said General Abdi. \"These attacks must stop, because they are distracting us from focusing on the security of the detention centres,\" he said, \"though we will always do our best.\"",
      "Inside Al-Sina, the largest prison for IS detainees, we saw the layers of security and felt the tension among the staff.",
      "The former educational institute in the city of Al-Hasakah holds about 5,000 men - suspected fighters or supporters of IS.",

      "Kurdish security sources say most of the prisoners in Al-Sina were with IS until its last stand and were deeply committed to its ideology.",
      "We were taken to meet a 28-year-old detainee - thin and softly spoken - who did not want to be named. He said he was speaking freely, though on the key issues he wouldn't say much.",
      "He told us he left his native Australia at the age of 19, to visit his grandmother in Cyprus.",
      "\"From there, one thing led to another,\" he said, \"and I ended up in Aleppo.\" He claimed he was working with an NGO in the city of Raqqa when IS took over.",

      "\"The new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa [the head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] made an address, saying he will give everyone their freedom. We also want freedom. We want to leave, most likely for Russia. It's the only country that will take us.\"",
      "The camp manager tells us that others believe IS will come to their rescue and break them out. She asked us not to use her name as she fears for her safety.",
      "\"Since the fall of Assad, the camp is calm. Typically, when it's this quiet, it means the women are organising themselves,\" she said. \"They have packed their bags ready to go. They say: 'We will get out of this camp soon and renew ourselves. We will come back again as IS.'\"",
      "She says there's a visible change, even in the children, who chant slogans and swear at passersby. \"They say: 'We will come back and get you. It [IS] is coming soon.'\"",

To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women.",

      "HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.",
      "The group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions.",
      "In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia.",
      "His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.",
      "Significant unease",
      "It is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda.",
      "But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.",
      "Even if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision.",
      "However this is not a new challenge for HTS.",
      "From IS to al-Qaeda to HTS",
      "For a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving.",
      "HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction.",
      "It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions.",
      "This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.",
      "While its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom.",
      "Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman.",
      "However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.",
      "How rebels won hearts and minds",
      "HTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies.",
      "The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.",
      "The civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa.",
      "The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches.",
      "But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth.",
      "Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.",
      "The group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers.",
      "During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia.",
      "However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.",
      "Hardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions",
      "Although some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo.",
      "Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib.",
      "Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".",
      "Despite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future.",
      "For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024.",
      "These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces.",
      "And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.",
      "Other rebel rivalries",
      "Until recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology.",
      "For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad.",
      "The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.",
      "HTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders.",
      "Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership.",
      "IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces.",
      "With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.",
      "To consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority.",
      "Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria.",
      "In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.",
      "'Power grab'",
      "When asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\"",
      "This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form.",
      "But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.",
      "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "HTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge.",
      "Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone.",
      "Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny.",
      "Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.",
      "Some viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria.",
      "Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives.",
      "Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key.",
      "A week ago the young woman wanting a photo was asked to cover her hair.",
      "This week al-Sharaa was photographed with two British diplomats, one of whom was Ann Snow, the UK's special representative for Syria. Her hair was uncovered.",

    "summary": "Leaked intelligence from military spies is helping turn the civil war in the resistance\u2019s favour, BBC finds.",
    "story": [
      "The once formidable Myanmar military is cracking from within - riddled with spies secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels, the BBC has found.",
      "The military only has full control of less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a BBC World Service investigation reveals.",
      "The junta still controls the major cities and remains \"extremely dangerous\" according to the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar. But it has lost significant territory over the past 12 months - see map below.",
      "The soldier spies are known as \"Watermelons\" - green on the outside, rebel red within. Outwardly loyal to the military but secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels whose symbolic colour is red.",
      "A major based in central Myanmar says it was the military's brutality that prompted him to switch sides.",
      "\"I saw the bodies of tortured civilians. I shed tears,\" says Kyaw [not his real name]. \"How can they be so cruel against our own people? We are meant to protect civilians, but now we're killing people. It's no longer an army, it's a force that terrorises.\"",
      "More than 20,000 people have been detained and thousands killed, the UN says, since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021 - triggering an uprising.",
      "Kyaw initially thought about defecting from the army, but decided with his wife that becoming a spy was \"the best way to serve the revolution\".",
      "When he judges it safe to do so, he leaks internal military information to the People's Defense Forces [PDF] - a network of civilian militia groups. The rebels use the intelligence to mount ambushes on the military or to avoid attacks. Kyaw also sends them some of his wage, so they can buy weapons.",
      "Spies like him are helping the resistance achieve what was once unthinkable.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November this year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "The investigation reveals that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass. Much of the remaining area is contested.",
      "The military now controls less than at any time since they first took control of the country in 1962, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled).",
      "Co-ordinated operations between ethnic armies and civilian militia groups have put the military on the back foot.",
      "After heavy territorial losses earlier this year Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing made a rare admission that his forces were under pressure.",
      "The leaked Watermelon intelligence from within the military is helping to tip the balance. Two years ago, the resistance set up a specialised unit to manage the growing network of spies and to recruit more.",
      "Agents like Win Aung [not his real name] collect the Watermelon leaks, verify them where possible, and then pass them on to the rebel leaders in the relevant area.",
      "He is a former intelligence officer who defected to the resistance after the coup. He says they are now getting new Watermelons every week and social media is a key recruitment tool.",
      "Their spies, he says, range from low-ranking soldiers to high-ranking officers. They also claim to have Watermelons in the military government - \"from the ministries down to village heads\".",
      "They are put through a strict verification process to ensure they are not double agents.",
      "Motivations for becoming a spy vary. While in Kyaw's case it was anger, for a man we are calling \"Moe\" - a corporal in the navy - it was simply a desire to survive for his young family.",
      "His wife, pregnant at the time, pushed him to do so, convinced the military was losing and he would die in battle.",
      "He began leaking information to the Watermelon unit about weapons and troop movements.",
      "This kind of intelligence is crucial, says pro-democracy rebel leader Daeva.",
      "The ultimate goal of his resistance unit is to take control of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city and his former home. But they are a long way off.",
      "The military retains the majority of major urban areas - home to crucial infrastructure and revenue.",
      "\"It's easier said than done to attack and occupy [Yangon], Daeva says. \"The enemy will not give up on [it] easily.\"",
      "Unable to physically penetrate the city, Daeva from his jungle base directs targeted attacks by underground cells in Yangon using Watermelon intelligence.",
      "In August, we witnessed him making one such call. We were not given the details but were told it was to direct an assassination attempt on a colonel.",
      "\"We will do it inside the enemy's security parameters,\" he told them. \"Be careful, the enemy is losing in every direction,\" he added, telling them that this meant they were more likely to be on alert for infiltrators and spies.",
      "Daeva says several major attacks by his unit have been the result of tip-offs.",
      "\"We started with nothing and now look at our success,\" says Daeva.",
      "But it comes at a cost. Watermelons have to live in fear of both sides, as navy corporal-turned spy Moe discovered.",
      "Deployed from Yangon to Rakhine - a border region where the military is fighting an ethnic group siding with the resistance - he had to live with the terror that his intelligence could mean he himself was attacked.",
      "In March this year, his anchored ship was hit with a projectile missile, followed by open fire. \"There was no place to run. We were like rats in a cage.\" Seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in the rebel attack.",
      "\"Our ability to protect [the moles] is very limited,\" admits Win Aung. \"We can't publicly announce that they are Watermelons. And we can't stop our forces from attacking any particular military convoy.\"",
      "He says that when this is explained to the Watermelons, however, they do not falter. Some have even responded: \"When it comes to that moment, don't hesitate, shoot.\"",
      "Outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "But there are times when the spies can no longer bear the danger.",
      "When Moe was set to be sent to another dangerous front line, he asked the Watermelon unit to smuggle him out into a resistance-controlled area. They do this using an underground network of monasteries and safe houses.",
      "He left in the dead of night. The next morning, when he did not show up for duty, soldiers came round to the house. They interrogated his wife Cho, but she remained tight-lipped.",
      "After days on the run Moe arrived at one of Daeva's bases. Daeva thanked him over video call, before asking him what role he wanted to play now. Moe replied that, given his young family, he would like a non-combat role and would instead share his knowledge of military training.",
      "A few weeks later he crossed into Thailand. Cho and the children fled their home too and hope to eventually join him and build a new life there.",
      "The military is aggressively trying to reclaim lost territory, carrying out a wave of deadly bombings. With Chinese- and Russian-made fighter jets, it is in the air that it has the upper hand. It knows that the resistance is far from being one homogenous group and is seeking to exploit divisions between them.",
      "\"As the junta loses control, their brutality increases. It's getting worse. The loss of life\u2026 the brutality, the torture as they lose ground, literally and figuratively,\" says UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews.",
      "The military is also conducting sweeps for Watermelons.",
      "\"When I heard about the sweeps, I stopped for a while,\" says Kyaw. He says he always acts like a staunch supporter of the military to avoid unwanted attention.",
      "But he is scared and doesn't know how long he can stay hidden. Defecting is not an option, as he worries about abandoning his ageing parents, so for now, he will keep acting as a military spy, hoping to see a day when the revolution is over.",
      "If and when that day comes, Watermelons like Kyaw and Moe will not be forgotten, Win Aung vows.",
      "\"We will treat them with honor, and allow them to choose what they want to do next in their lives.\"",
      "The military did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "About the data:",
      "Researchers commissioned by the BBC questioned multiple sources from 12 February to 13 November 2024 for each of more than 14,000 village groups to assess the level of military control in their area.",
      "The names and boundaries of village groups were sourced from the Myanmar Information Management Unit, or MIMU, which is hosted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).",

    "summary": "The lawsuit lays out Blake Lively's allegations against Justin Baldoni during their time working on \"It Ends with Us.\"",
    "story": [
      "Actress Blake Lively is suing her \"It Ends with Us\" co-star Justin Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "For months, rumors swirled of an onset of discord between the two actors that appears to have culminated with a lawsuit by Lively in which she alleges Baldoni \u2013 who was also the film's director \u2013 caused her \"severe emotional distress.\"",
      "The complaint, which was obtained by CBS News, names Baldoni, the studio behind \"It Ends With Us\" and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0first reported the complaint, which was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "The complaint also says Baldoni \"abruptly pivoted away from\" the movie's marketing plan and \"used domestic violence 'survivor content' to protect his public image.\"",
      "\"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\" attorney Bryan Freedman told the AP in a statement. Freedman represents Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.",
      "Freedman pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio \"proactively\" hired a crisis manager \"due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\" He said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film \"if her demands were not met.\" Those demands were not specified in the statement.",
      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" while promoting the film, Baldoni said he hoped the movie would help to create a safer world through compassion and empathy. He said he wanted men to go see the romance movie and take accountability in their lives after watching it.",
      "\"I want men to go to the theater and in some ways see a version of themselves. You have two very different characters. Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",
      "A spokesperson for SAG-AFTRA, the union for TV and movie actors, told CBS News in a statement that Lively's allegations are \"startling and troubling\" and that \"retaliation for reporting misconduct or inappropriate behavior is illegal and wrong.\"",
      "\"We applaud Blake Lively's courage in speaking out on issues of retaliation and harassment and for her request to have an intimacy coordinator for all scenes with nudity or sexual content. This is an important step that helps ensure a safe set,\" the statement said. \"We all have a right to be treated with dignity and respect on the job and to work in an environment free of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.\"",
      "In the statement, the union's spokesperson urged anyone who may be experiencing abusive conduct to report violations on its SAG-AFTRA Safe Place app and to their employer.",

      "NEW YORK -- Just shy of his 70th birthday, Denzel Washington has a new line to add to an already impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.",
      "The legendary actor was recently given a minister's license at a church ceremony in Harlem where he was also baptized.",
      "\"It took a while, but I am here\"",
      "There is fame and there is faith, and Washington has an abundance of both. It was an emotional moment for the 69-year-old star when he received his license Saturday at the Kelly Temple Church of God in Christ.",
      "\"It took a while, but I'm here,\" Washington said.",
      "In his remarks, Washington remembered a prediction made about him when he was just 20 years old.",
      "\"Ms. Ruth Green was known to have the gift of prophecy \u2014 some of you have heard this story. And she prophesied and said, 'Boy, you are going to travel the world and preach to millions of people.' If He can do this for me, there's nothing he can't do for you,\" Washington said.",
      "At the ceremony Washington was joined by his wife, Pauletta. They married in 1983. The minister's license will allow him to become ordained at a future date.",
      "\"He's like a brother to me\"",
      "Church deacon Arthur Dean told CBS News New York he is proud.",

      "Local fans were equally moved.",

      "And now, Washington's influence has grown, fanning out from the Theater District and movie screens, Uptown and beyond.",
      "\"When you become a minister you have words for the public, words for everybody. You have to reach out to people even more than being in Hollywood,\" Dean said.",

      "As the holiday season lights up New York City, few traditions shine brighter than the iconic holiday windows at Bergdorf Goodman. The luxury department store's displays are more than just decorations \u2014 they are works of art.",
      "And the mastermind behind the art is David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman. He has been with the store for more than 20 years and oversees the design of the windows each year.",
      "He noted that there's no school for making window displays, and that it seems no one in the field sets out to do the job \"on purpose.\"",
      "\"We just kind of happened into it,\" he said. \"And we wouldn't wanna do anything else because we're doing a little of everything. We're doing a little theater, a little storytelling, a little advertising, a little fashion.\"",
      "This year's theme is \"Toast of the Town,\" a nod to the 200th anniversary of Fifth Avenue's retail strip.

Hoey's team used a variety of materials, including actual taxi parts, to create scenes that celebrate New York.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

      "I asked if \"A Very Potter Musical\" was the first musical to go viral. \"I don't know; I guess we'll let the YouTube historians sort of decide the validity of that,\" Criss said.",
      "But Criss took a detour on his way to Broadway, by becoming a TV star. \"'Glee' was happening at the time,\" he said. \"And I went out for it, like hundreds of thousands of other people in my situation at that time. And I happened to book it.\"",
      "He played Blaine Anderson, and quickly became a fan favorite. \"I owe my tenure on that show to the sub-cultural fan base army that we had gathered from the Potter stuff,\" he said.",

      "Criss said, \"This show begins with a song which is the question the show posits: Why love? Why do we do it? If we know that loving something enters you in a contract that has an inexorable back end \u2013 which is the loss of something \u2013 why do we do that, if we know that that's gonna happen?\"",
      "According to Criss, this show came along at the perfect time. He and his wife, Mia, have a two-and-a-half year-old daughter, and earlier this year they welcomed a baby son.",
      "I asked, \"Does this feel like the best year of your life?\"",
      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",
      "He's had some hard years, too. In 2020, his father, Bill, died at 78 from a heart condition. In 2022, his brother, Chuck, died at 36 by suicide.",
      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",

      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",

      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",

      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",

      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said.

      "Americans are being urged not to buy or use liquid-burning portable firepits sold for tabletops and other uses following the deaths of two people and dozens of injuries.",
      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",

      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",
      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",
      "The Congolese government had sent a rapid intervention team to the Kwango province, 435 miles southeast of capital city Kinshasa, consisting of epidemiologists and other medical experts. Their objective was to identify the disease and mount a suitable response.

    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, appears to have been given new life after an appeals court on Monday determined its rules can be enforced as the case proceeds. The law requires small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of the Jan. 1, 2025 deadline, although businesses that started in 2024 were given 90 days to register.",
      "Some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's reporting rule?",
      "The reporting rule is the CTA's Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirement, which mandates small businesses to register the following with FinCEN, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

      "What happens if I don't register under the CTA?",
      "The penalties are up to $591 per day for failure to file, according to FinCEN.",
      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",
      "There are 23 types of businesses that are exempt from the beneficial ownership information filing, according to the Chamber of Commerce. These include many publicly traded companies and nonprofits, as well as some large operating companies.",
      "Many types of banks and other financial services businesses don't need to file, according to FinCEN. Some other types of businesses, such as many sole proprietorships, are also exempt, it noted. (A list and Q&A on exemptions can be seen here.)",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 3 million Americans will receive full Social Security benefits under legislation passed in the waning hours of the current Congress and now headed to President Biden, who is expected to sign into law.",
      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Democrats uniformly voted for the measure, while Republicans in the Senate were split, with 20 voting to pass it and 20 voting against it. Four senators did not vote, including California's Adam Schiff, a Democrat; Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia; and two Republicans \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance of Ohio.",
      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill.\u00a0Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",

      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",

      "\"Walmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a news release. \"Companies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\"",
      "Both Walmart and Branch vowed a vigorous defense.",
      "\"The CFPB's rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law. The CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation,\" the retailing giant said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Branch echoed Walmart's stance, accusing the CFPB of misstating \"the law and facts.\" The CFPB's suit \"includes intentional omissions\" to cover what the company called the bureau's \"overreach, it said in an email.",
      "\"Branch has provided Walmart and their driver partners valuable services allowing quick and easy access to funds via their business accounts \u2014 a key fact the bureau's press release omits,\" it said.",
      "The CFPB alleges in its suit that the two firms violated federal law for two years starting in 2021. The company and Branch are accused of using drivers' information, including their Social Security numbers, to open accounts without permission. Drivers' pay was then deposited into the accounts without their authorization, resulting in drivers paying more than $10 million in fees to Branch to instantly transfer their earnings into accounts of their choosing, the agency alleges.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:15:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "summary": "Starbucks baristas and Amazon delivery drivers are on strike in handful of U.S. cities as they seek wage increases.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years. Other publicly traded retailers, including Macy's and Kohl's, have faced pressure from major investors in order to provide bigger returns to investors, while also attempting to fend off competition from lower-cost rivals such as Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool. They will likely run the business as a retailer rather than as some kind of financial play thing which, in our view, is a very positive thing for the long term health of the brand.\"",

      "Nordstrom's board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company \u2014 recusing themselves from that vote.",

      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker.

      "Update, 12:45 a.m. Saturday:\u00a0The U.S. government avoided a prolonged government shutdown after the House and Senate approved a short-term\u00a0funding bill,\u00a0sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "As the fight over a federal spending bill went down to the wire, the U.S. faced a looming deadline for a government shutdown that could have began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. That raised questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted if funding lapsed just days before the holidays.",
      "The threat of a shutdown stemmed from controversy over a spending bill to extended funding through March 14, but which fell apart after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill. A revised version also failed on Thursday before another attempt on Friday finally passed.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Could a shutdown hurt the U.S. economy?",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers, among other impacts, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "\"A government shutdown could leave a visible mark on the economy,\" he wrote. \"Apart from the direct macroeconomic consequences of a shutdown, financial markets and private sector confidence could also be affected.\"",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

      "Workers at Starbucks stores began a five-day strike Friday to protest lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "The strikes by baristas and other workers were scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle and could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve. Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks' baristas, said at least 10 locations were closed down as of midday Friday.",
      "In Los Angeles, striking Starbucks barista Cassie Pritchard told CBS News Friday that workers are looking for \"fair wages that are livable\u2026You should be able to afford rent, food and healthcare.\"",
      "Pritchard said Starbucks' offer of a 1.5% yearly raise won't even keep up with inflation.",
      "\"It's a pay cut in reality,\" Pritchard said. \"It's a nominal pay raise, but it's only in name.\"",
      "The walkouts came a day after the Teamsters union announced strikes at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Starbucks said early Friday there was \"no significant impact\" to its store operations.",
      "\"We are aware of disruption at a small handful of stores, but the overwhelming majority of our U.S. stores remain open and serving customers as normal,\" the Seattle-based coffee giant said in a statement.",
      "Workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize, but Starbucks has nearly 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores",
      "Starbucks Workers United, which began the unionization effort in 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The union noted that Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But it said the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years.",
      "\"Our CEO is the face of corporate greed in America right now,\" Pritchard told CBS News.",
      "\"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners,\" Starbucks Workers United President Lynne Fox said.",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week.",
      "\"We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations are currently focused on pay raises. Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of at least 1.5% for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",
      "Starbucks said the union wants to increase the minimum wage for hourly workers by 64% immediately and 77% over the life of a three-year contract.",
      "Starbucks said it already pays an average of $18 per hour. With benefits \u2014 including health care, free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 Starbucks' pay package is worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "The strikes won't be the first for Starbucks during the busy holiday season. In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",
      "The union and the company struck a different tone early this year, when they returned to the bargaining table and pledged to reach an agreement. Starbucks said it has held nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and has reached more than 30 agreements with the union.",
      "But Starbucks has struggled with falling sales and lower customer traffic in the U.S. and abroad this year, and the CEO who promised to work for a labor agreement, Laxman Narasimhan, was forced out this summer. Niccol quashed a unionization campaign at Chipotle when he was the CEO there, but he pledged to work constructively with the union in a September letter.",
      "Now, Starbucks and the union appear to be at an impasse.",

      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S., as the House appeared to have averted a government shutdown late Friday.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",

Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",

The bill is expected to pass in the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",

      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",

      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to spend more money heating their homes this winter than on holiday gifts, according to new research.",
      "The elevated cost of staying warm indoors amid cold outdoor temperatures comes after an unusually hot summer, that led to households spending bigger shares of their budgets on cooling costs, compared with previous years, according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:46:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

      "Senators on Wednesday voted 73-27 to approve a motion to move forward with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, and then on Thursday voted 73-23 to proceed to the bill, with both tallies clearing the 60-vote fillibuster threshold. Only a simple majority is needed for final passage in the Senate in order to pass the bill to President Biden's desk.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure on Wednesday. Vance and fellow Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Joe Manchin, an independent and outgoing senator from West Virginia, did not participate in Thursday's vote.",
      "The Senate was scheduled to reconvene on Friday, and is expected to resume consideration of the measure after votes related to confirming two judges to serve in California.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Wednesday. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",

      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.

      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost.

    "story": [
      "Although 2024 is winding down, the U.S. housing crisis\u00a0lives on. But even as steep home prices and elevated mortgage rates sideline many would-be homebuyers, some real estate markets around the country continue to attract them.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) this month released a list of 10 local housing markets it expects to be hot spots in 2025, outperforming the rest of the country in sales. The locations have been chosen by NAR based on their current individual strengths across 10 key economic, demographic and housing factors that are considered predictors of future market activity.",
      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "\"It's really the launch on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms that allow these characters or animals to blow up like crazy,\" said Richard Derr, who has owned a Learning Express Toys franchise in Lake Zurich, Ill., for nearly 30 years and is also a regional manager for the specialty toy store chain.",

Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",

      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you broadly about the environment we are in. It's a pretty significant one. Your potential successor, Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's pick to run Homeland Security, has no law enforcement experience and has never worked at an agency like this. Have you spoken to her yet? And what do you think her biggest challenge will be?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I have. I have spoken with the governor. We had a very positive conversation. We are both perfectly aligned on our dedication to a smooth and effective transition. I care very deeply about the well-being of this department, dedicating so many years to public service, she expressed her dedication to the well-being of this department. She is a governor, so she knows how to lead, and I am optimistic and hopeful and dedicated to her success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been hiccups with transition so far, in terms of even just the information that is being shared because of these lack of signing off on paperwork at certain government agencies. What is it going like? How smooth is it here?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Here, the transition team has landed at the Department of Homeland Security. We have begun to produce documents and provide information to the transition team. I happened to run into the transition team leader yesterday here at DHS headquarters and- and we are working well together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a sense yet of what things will be like? You said you're worried about the department. There's a vow to cut back on bureaucrats. Do you think a lot of these workers that you say you're dedicated to won't have jobs in a few months?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh, I hope that's not the case. We are, quite frankly, a perennially under-resourced department. You know, people take a look at our budget and, and think about how big it is, but one has to measure how big it is compared to what the mission demands are, and those mission demands are incredibly vast. Our department is a sprawling one. Our mission is extraordinarily diverse. Of course, the border receives a great deal of attention, but the cyber security challenges, the criminal investigative work that we perform, the disaster response that we execute, maritime security, our United States Coast Guard, our protective mission by United States Secret Service. We were speaking earlier of TSA and so much more. Our department- the challenge for the governor coming in is to address such a diverse set of missions, but fortunately, she will be able to rely on extraordinarily dedicated and talented experts in this department. We cannot afford to lose any.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a heightened threat environment on the foreign front, on the domestic front, we recently saw that killing of the United HealthCare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan. Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, Margaret, it's not for me to comment on a pending criminal case, I will not do that. First of all, let us take a step back and note the tremendous tragedy. A father of two children, a family man was murdered in New York City in cold blood, first and foremost. Secondly, you spoke of the heightened threat environment, the rhetoric on social media following that, that murder is extraordinarily alarming. It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter. Of course, there's also the threat of foreign terrorism, as well as the actions of adverse nation states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I- look we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And that's against CEOs, that's against the government, that's against leadership.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances in the language of violence, accompanying or being a part of those narratives, is something that we're very concerned about, that, that is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the the the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the healthcare industry and what that company was doing, it's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: And and the victim is a person\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you about a trend, because often these things are discussed in purely political terms, as political violence, but it seems like you're saying it's almost broader.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh it is. It is. It is not purely a political rhetoric. We see a wide range of narratives that's- that really drive some individuals to violence, and we have a responsibility to know the threat landscape and see what we can do working with communities to prevent that violence from actually occurring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean there were reports during the hurricane aftermath in North Carolina about militias looking for FEMA workers, for federal response workers.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: So we had to pull FEMA workers out of the field who were responding to victims' needs because of false information that was deliberately disseminated on social media, such as, 'the FEMA worker is coming to take your land.' Absolutely false. They are there at great personal sacrifice to help others. That's who they are. And we had to pull them from the field by reason of that threat environment, temporarily, albeit, but nevertheless impactfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That just shows a massive not just distrust- but you were worried about the threat of violence against them",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We most certainly were. And I have to tell you, the FEMA employee who is engaged in a search and rescue mission does not ask about the political party of the individual whom that FEMA employee is rescuing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, should not.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is- and does not, and that is a rescue operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We mentioned how broad your portfolio is. So I want to move to another part of that, the US border. 'Face the Nation' has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers. And I don't think- I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents. Why is it so hard to reunite families, and how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force, a multi-agency effort that I led here in the Department of Homeland Security. But there's more work to be done. Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find. Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma. So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It is unclear, because the- we were not left with good records, data was not kept, and so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome. We could not have done our work, what we accomplished, without the partnership of groups in the community that had other connections to separated families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-government agencies. ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023 according to the report we read. The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, we\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are. That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. What we do is we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children. Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking, but there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian, and they move and sometimes the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise, I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized. There are a number of reasons why we might lose track of an individual that is not necessarily specific to this administration. That has been a long standing challenge in the immigration system, one example of why that system is so broken, why the duration of time in proceedings is unacceptably long and has to be remedied. Remember, we're dealing with a system that was last reformed in 1996.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what more can you do to combat the trafficking that is happening of some of these children, or the exploitation of some of these children, is that up to Congress as well, or can Homeland do more well?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We have done more. As a matter of fact, our entire worksite enforcement strategy has been to focus our criminal investigators and our other officers on employers who exploit vulnerable individuals, including underage individuals, and take advantage of the fact they that they are migrants seeking work in the United States and pay them substandard wages, have them employed in substandard working conditions and the like. And so that is where we have, I would submit correctly, focused our energies, and we've been unprecedented in that focus and in the success of that focus. We need more resources. The problem of the-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a money problem?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: We need more personnel. We certainly do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the exploitation of them, are you limited in your authorities at this point, when the Trump administration promises they will change it? Can they change it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: This was a- this has been a problem that has been decades long. This is not a new problem. I wish them tremendous success. I will support them in their efforts to end the scourge of human exploitation and human trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So at this point last year, in December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration. How much of that drop off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is critically one element of it. It is not the only element of it. The President took decisive action after politics killed what would have been an extraordinarily enduring solution to what is a broken immigration system, that bipartisan legislation that I was very proud to be a part of would have- would have really delivered a solution. Because politics killed it, the President took executive action in June of this year, we began to execute very successfully and very rapidly that executive action. And that has been a key driver of the- the low number of encounters at our border we are now delivering to the incoming administration, a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019 the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the US since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Oh, it is Margaret. It is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War Two. This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States. It- it is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world. When I speak to our partners from the Five Eyes, our closest allies, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, they raise immigration as the first issue of concern to them. This is something not unique to the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not and it has tremendous political impact.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It has a tremendous political impact, and that is why we need Congress to act in the- in the- in the wake of Congress's failure to act, the President took executive action, and therefore we're delivering to the incoming administration a border that is more secure than it was in 2019.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Biden administration, and I think you have said to me, one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days, and then fast forward, you had this bipartisan near miss on a border bill all that time passed, why wait until five months before the US election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow? That ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret remember where we were when the President took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prior administration had imposed title 42 which is a public health authority, and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done. There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42 which we did. Remember- and that was pressure to maintain Title 42 a bipartisan pressure that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Which was pinned on the CDC as a health measure. But sure, yes.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That held until May of 2023 and we ended the workings of Title 42 because this country had escaped the throes of COVID 19 more rapidly and more successfully than any country in the hemisphere and, quite frankly, the world. We then turned to Congress and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better. We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding. Denied, despite a desperate need for it. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics. Looking back now in hindsight, in 20/20 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Republicans argue in this back and forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis, starting at day one, when Trump-era immigration policy was peeled back. Remain in Mexico, the 100 day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction. Did those measures, and I know you weren't yet in office, personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Remember something, Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea. In 2018, and I will be approximate in my numbers Margaret, in 2018 there were approximately 550- 560,000 individuals encountered at the southern border. Remain in Mexico was implemented in January of 2019. In 2019 there were approximately 960- 970,000 individuals encountered at the southern border. The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019 and that is reflected worldwide. And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Remember something also about the executive action that the President took in May- in- in June of this year. We also, over time, built capabilities that we did not previously have. Not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world. We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four. And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case. We have been removing Chinese nationals who have no lawful basis to remain in the United States back to the People's Republic of China for the first time since 2018 and we have run a number of removal flights to that country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, on that data. So, President Obama was referred to by activists as the deporter in chief, because of the large number of deportations on his watch. But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10 year high under President Biden. A 10 year high. So what shifted at DHS that- that prompted this deportation of more than what 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year. That- that's one of the highest numbers in recent years--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS:-- Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- If Congress didn't give you the power, how did you do it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we did it with skill, with strategy, and with unflinching dedication to that mission, and let me share with you, I am an immigrant to this country, and what this country gave me drove me to public service. I spent my first 12 years in government service as a federal prosecutor, and the conclusion that I have lived and the conclusion that defines this country is the following, that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, and if individuals do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States, we will remove them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would also suggest that there is the ability to do it without Congress acting, right? That's the downside of showing you can make it work.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes- but Margaret, we made those very impressive statistics happen. But there is much more work to do, and what we have to do is to ensure that the problem does not continue. This broken system needs to be fixed. And it's not just to ensure that individuals who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States are removed, but it's also to ensure that we are providing humanitarian relief to those who qualify one of our proudest traditions, and that we are also fueling the economy. Our need for skilled labor is something that we hear from companies and public officials, regardless of party affiliation, and yet we are capped at the number of skilled workers that we can introduce into the United States economy. By figures, by ceiling set in 1996.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about H-1b visas and skilled worker visas, things like that.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the enforcement actions here, Goldman Sachs estimates more than half of the migrants since 2021 entered illegally. Does that sound right to you? Roughly 5 million people entered the US illegally?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Remember, a certain number were encountered at the border. But we have, as you cited earlier, we have removed, returned and expelled, given the operation of Title 42 during the COVID-19 pandemic, an extraordinary number, and we continue to return or remove individuals. But there is no question, there is no question, and this is a sign of a broken immigration system- that individuals who were encountered at the border are in the United States, but they are in immigration enforcement proceedings. One of the problems is that those proceedings take seven to ten years before they're resolved, because our immigration court system is so backlogged, and that backlog has been increasing year, over year, over year, ever since I can remember and I entered the Department of Homeland Security for the first time in 2009.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Donald Trump says within the first 100 days, they're going to have a surge of resources through Congress to carry out what he is calling mass deportations. The former ICE chief Tom Homan, who used to work with you.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We went back and looked. He's praised you. He said, \"Me and Ali didn't always agree on immigration, but he listened. He's a great American, and he loves this country.\"",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is, that is true. That is-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- A lot has changed--",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I love- I love this country. I've worked very closely with Tom Homan, and I'm very proud of the work that he and I performed together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he said you had a where he told Tucker Carlson, you two had a falling out over transgender policy and ICE detention facilities, and he was forced to sign something that provided medical care to them. Is that how you remember things and- and this is the person who will be part of carrying out the policies you say need to be fixed?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I was disappointed to learn of that statement that's not true.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That wasn't a falling out between the two of you?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: No, I didn't have a falling out with- with Tom Homan. We worked very well together throughout my tenure as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I was disappointed to hear that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that just politics?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: I- I can tell you this, it's not true. Whatever it is, is not true.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been the recipient of a lot of upset over the immigration policy because of your job. You are the face of it, right? And the Republican House impeached you. I wonder when you leave this office, are you concerned about your personal security?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, I'm incredibly proud of the work that this department has done over the past four years as I've been privileged to serve as its secretary. I'm very sad to leave the department, and it mirrors the sadness I have felt each time. I have left the federal government as a political appointee. I started as a career appointee. I have- I have faith in the American people. That faith is when we see a cold-blooded murder of a United Health Care executive, it's- it's rattled, but that's the actions of a- of an individual not reflective of the American public and of the democracy in which we live. I am the face- I am the face of it, and that is a responsibility I willingly assumed when I agreed to take this position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, it's a question. And you know why I had to ask it because of the environment we're in. I want to ask you about China, if I could, before we go. You said recently that this massive Chinese hacking known as Salt Typhoon, the hacking of eight telecom companies that siphoned up this metadata, the phone call records, logs and information for millions, potentially of Americans, was accessed. Why hasn't the US government stopped it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, first of all, the intrusion is a very significant one and an extraordinarily impactful one and an absolutely unacceptable one. And the President has demonstrated a strong response to the People's Republic of China. It is very sophisticated--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Rhetorically?--",
      "SEC. MAYORKAS: I'm sorry,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Rhetorically? When he met with Xi Jinping?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Well, just recently, the United States Department of Commerce proposed\u00a0 an action against China Telecom. So this is an ongoing situation. It is not static. The intrusion is a very sophisticated one. The telecommunications companies are working very vigorously to remediate it. They are working in partnership with us, with the cyber security and infrastructure security agency within the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the federal government. So this is a partnership in an effort to remediate the situation. It is very complicated, and we're very dedicated to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the largest intelligence compromise, potentially in US history.",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: It is a very serious compromise, and requires very serious action to remediate and recover from it, and also very serious response to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you find it?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: That is not something I can- I can speak to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The incoming national security advisor to Donald Trump, Mike Waltz was on Face the Nation last Sunday and said the US needs to go on offense, start imposing higher costs and consequences to people and entities like countries stealing data, but also to those who spy on us they are, \"literally, putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.\" A cyber time bomb. Is that what's happening?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: You- we started our discussion speaking about a heightened threat environment, and I identified three vectors, three primary vectors, the threat of foreign terrorism. And obviously we're keenly focused on the instability in Syria, and whether that can create some space for the reemergence of ISIS there. And foreign terrorism is, of course, the founding reason for our Department of Homeland Security, the threat of domestic violent extremism. And we've talked about that and I mentioned the actions of adverse nation states. It is really an extraordinary time now. Adverse nation states have exhibited a willingness to use the cyber domain in an effort to. To threaten our homeland security and our national security. The infiltration, the hack of the telecommunications companies is one example. We've seen critical infrastructure hacked as well, and it does require a response, and I am confident that the incoming administration will be vigilant in executing that response.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you put that at the top of the list for the incoming Secretary?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Would put that at the top of the list. Whether it's at the very top, I'd want to think through, but it is at the top of the list most certainly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, as you come to the time, as you come to the end of your time here, what is the thing that keeps you up at night?",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Margaret, we- it's not singular. It's not singular. Our mission space is so vast. Our mission is so diverse. There are challenges in each area of this department. If you asked me for an embracing concern, it is the safety and security of the American people that is our commitment, and ensuring that that is preserved and not in any way encroached upon, is our highest obligation, and I'm incredibly proud to serve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time. Thank you,",
      "SECRETARY MAYORKAS: Thank you, Margaret."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: A potential government shutdown is averted in the 11th hour, but president-elect Trump and first pal Elon Musk show they will disrupt the way Washington works.",
      "Nudging Congress to do their work is technically still President Biden's job, but it was Trump and Musk calling the shots by social media last week. They didn't get all of what they wanted, but will the drama prove to be a preview of what's to come within the GOP in 2025?",
      "We will talk with two House Republicans, Arkansan French Hill and Texan Tony Gonzales.",
      "Then, outgoing Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas weighs in on extremism and the immigration crisis.",
      "And West Virginia independent Joe Manchin reflects on his 14 years in the Senate as he leaves office, with advice for both parties going forward.",
      "Finally, an update on the new efforts to locate journalist Austin Tice, who's been missing in Syria for 12 years.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025?",
      "Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after president-elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line.",
      "Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid- March. You are one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's pretty simple. My constituents were against the C.R. just as much as I was against the C.R.",
      "It's been a tough week, though. It started with the tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I have worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I have been working with others to get that done. I think that's important.",
      "And then, in the House, of course, we had this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1,500-page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in D.C., and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills.",
      "You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though. He was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is, I think C.R.s are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Right.",
      "That's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job. We have ran that play before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We're \u2013 in my eyes, you use Christmas. You use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, let's get it done now.",
      "There's also a bigger danger to this, too, is, if we're not funding the government long term\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: \u2026 now all of a sudden, you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well.",
      "So, basically, it was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the C.R.",
      "But I want to ask you about the dynamic here because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the speaker of the House. What role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president. We have a vice president. We have a speaker. And it feels like - - as if Elon Musk is our prime minister.",
      "And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unelected.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Well, unelected.",
      "But, I mean, he has a voice. And I think a lot of \u2013 large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these \u2013 a 1,500-page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order.",
      "The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over this spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: They were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united. And it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal.",
      "Do you support him if \u2013 he's standing for reelection. Should he still lead the party, if you're saying he was leading in the wrong direction with a 15-page (sic) initial funding deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. And I do. I do support Speaker Johnson. I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats on the House, right?",
      "So that's a tough job to begin with. But the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with \u2013 with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members to find a solution just goes to prove that he's found a way.",
      "But there also \u2013 this can't be the norm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the C.R. is, this cannot be the norm. We have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills.",
      "Homeland security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But, right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention.",
      "Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July. And there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81-year-old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public.",
      "Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I wasn't aware.",
      "I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining in age, like a lot of members do. And, sadly, some of these members wait until it's too long \u2013 too \u2013 too \u2013 things have gone too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think it's maybe \u2013 I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it.",
      "I'd say, on the other side of the aisle, it's the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think this goes \u2013 gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there. And, apparently, it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows.",
      "I need to get to the border, because that is \u2013 you have, what, 800 miles of the border in your district.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Border Patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low.",
      "Does that mean, coming into office, that essentially the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Oh, no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has started to do some things right, the Trump administration is going to do everything right, in this manner.",
      "And I will tell you why. This is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat \u2013 the worldwide threats to homeland \u2013 to our homeland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I will share some of the open-source stuff in Syria. A lot of us are rooting for a free Syria.",
      "A free Syria brings a lot of opportunities for first ability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy. He imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going?",
      "Well, let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Of course not.",
      "But do we know who these people are and who are \u2013 and are they coming into our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about? You want to block travel from Muslim-majority countries, like the Trump team is talking about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want \u2013 I want the president \u2013 I want the president to enforce the laws that we have on the books, that simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no? Those aren't laws on the books.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Refugees are accepted in the United States of America.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And they should be, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want us to follow our laws, right? And if \u2013 and if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We want people to come and live the American dream, those that are fleeing political persecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: But we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to get his thoughts on the homeland security challenges facing the new next administration.",
      "Here's part of our conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We recently saw that killing of the UnitedHealthcare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): The rhetoric on social media following that \u2013 that murder is extraordinarily alarming.",
      "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country. And, unfortunately, we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I \u2013 look, we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's against CEOs? That's against the government? That's against leadership?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances.",
      "And the language of violence accompanying or being a part of those narratives is something that we're very concerned about that. That is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the health care industry and what that company was doing. It's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And \u2013 and the victim is a person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers.",
      "And I don't think \u2013 I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents.",
      "Why is it so hard to reunite families? And how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force. But there's more work to be done.",
      "Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma.",
      "So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is unclear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 because the \u2013 we were not left with good records. Data was not kept. And so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.",
      "The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, we certainly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.",
      "That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: What we do is, we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.",
      "Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking. But there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian. And they move, and, sometimes, the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.",
      "I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration.",
      "How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is, critically, one element of it. It is not the only element of it.",
      "The president took executive action in June of this year. That has been a key driver of the \u2013 the low number of encounters at our border. We are now delivering\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the U.S. since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, it is \u2013 Margaret, it is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War II.",
      "This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you have said to me one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then, fast forward, you had this bipartisan near- miss on a border bill. All that time passed.",
      "Why wait until five months before the U.S. election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow, that ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, remember where \u2013 Margaret, remember where we were when the president took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The prior administration had imposed Title 42, which is a public health authority\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42, which we did. That held until May of 2023.",
      "We then turned to Congress, and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding.",
      "Denied. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics.",
      "Looking back now in hindsight, in 20/20, if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "Because Republicans argue in this back-and-forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis starting at day one, when Trump era immigration policy was peeled back, remain in Mexico, the 100-day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction.",
      "Did those measures \u2013 and I know you weren't yet in office personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Remember something. Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea.",
      "The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019. And that is reflected worldwide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",

We also over time built capabilities that we did not previously have, not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world.",
      "We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But that data you just cited shows deportation of migrants is at a 10-year high under President Biden, a 10-year high. So what shifted at DHS that \u2013 that prompted this deportation of more than, what, 200,000 unauthorized migrants from the United States this year?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you.",
      "This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did.",
      "Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines? I mean won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the president's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page because with narrow majorities we've got to work together. And that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Mark Short, who was the director of legislative affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025.",
      "What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and, again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, wanted to use the budget reconciliation process. That's still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of The Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business having access to capital.",
      "So, I think we're on the same page. And I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that last year when we - last year, in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security for an all of the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on. We are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor, as well, as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on U.S. investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies.",
      "Your Democrat colleague, Rosa DeLauro, insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation were - was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the - America's - America's national security. But striking that balance has been difficult. But I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people - a majority of members clearly wanted a simple, straightforward, continuing resolution and not what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR.",
      "So, I think president - I mean Speaker Johnson did a good job coming back around from that, focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with Majority Leader Thune on how we would tackle reconciliation to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. That's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing chair of House Financial Services, was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have a strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica De La Cru of Texas. And we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan, our conference chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from south Florida, joining our committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: They will be active leaders in Financial Services policymaking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, I know you've been trying to restrict Captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, first, we need the United States to be very active, work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime as it relates to all the people murdered, killed, imprisoned, tortured, in the - from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing Captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that. But it needs to be stopped.",
      "But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict Captagon and cut off the funding because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime. And that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that.",
      "Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well, a source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former Congressman Matt Gaetz's alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. Last month, on this program, you said it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "Do you still object?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And it's not - well, I don't know, but that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are - they have released documents before. But I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution because you open up a pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years, conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (I-WV): January 6th was a bridge too far for me. And I think everyone knows that. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him and we always got along great. We're very friendly. Had - just - we just had disagreements on some things. But you can do that.",
      "When the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray with everything you have that the president will be successful.",
      "This is about our country. And I want him to succeed. And I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I - I have -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I have - I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that won't (ph) let that happen. They have the chance (ph). They have the power. And I think there's enough Republican senators, and Democrat senators too. That are not going to let the filibuster blow apart, they're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to. It takes four Republican senators, just four. And I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That will protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around. And in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's the power of the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans, \"a once in a generation investment in border security,\" but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So, with 51 votes, not the 60, you - you're saying right now that this is - this is not how the system's supposed to work.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Hold on, Margaret. If - he's going to have to show the financial connotation and the cost it's causing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then step two is tax reform. That's the plant.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Yes. Well, here, I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically, when you've given up, that you can't work with the other side, they come out of the box that way. So, this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting. That was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. We wrote that bill in my committee. And I guarantee you, I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I feel - no, I feel horrible about that we had to do it in reconciliation. I feel horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. We didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3 percent. We brought down gas prices from $5 to $3. We did all of that. But the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic. The prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort, made it almost unbearable for people to - for the burden they were carrying.",
      "The IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president-elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. When you pass a piece of legislation, and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it.",
      "If the White House says, I want this type of interpretation, that makes it very, very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. I said, you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way. In spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals, we're still depending on China when we were supposed to be weaning ourself off of China. He can fix that immediately.",
      "President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He - and change - change the bill. It will be his - it will be his energy bill. But, you know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Reprograming, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there, tax credits for nuclear biofuels. Do you think parts - you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I think it almost has to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: The investments are made. And most of the investments - the majority of the investments are made in what you would consider red states. Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: They couldn't talk about it. He was tongue tied.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, can't you just exact - tell what the bill did. They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. The only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything with renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running.",
      "Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So, I said, we're going to produce what we need, and we do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So, the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil, you wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill, then he can change it, change the name, it will be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. OK? My Democrat friends are so far off the rail. OK, I love them all, but they're - I said, guys. But a lot of them really understand it. They just can't speak it because the base has gone so far. And that's - I just - I couldn't take it anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, she is a Republican, but she's also known for being pretty independent.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Thank God for rank choice voting. Without - without rank choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the Democrat and Republican Party control the primaries, they can control you up here. So, they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry, you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So, I'm going to find somebody else that I can control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who else is going to stand up to the president-elect when they disagree and be willing to say so out loud? Are there other senators up here who will do it?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I would hope - you know, you - my father used to tell me, if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're OK. If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I never did say, oh, you're wrong. You don't go - you can't start out a conversation that's going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ambassador charged by the Biden administration with freeing Americans held overseas, Roger Carstens, traveled to Syria late last week to make the first known contact with that country's caretaker government following the ouster of dictator Bashar al Assad two weeks ago. Carstens sought help finding American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago.",
      "We spoke with Carstens on Friday about why it was important to be on the ground in Syria.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told reporters that you were amazed at the number of secret prisons that Bashar al Assad had, more than 40 of them. Have those prisons been searched yet, and do you know if journalist Austin Tice was held in them?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS (U.S. Special Presidential Envoy For Hostage Affairs): So, it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean you would almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have, like, 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing and yet in a way fascinating.",
      "But really the bottom line is that we have to help and - or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search has been exhausted.",
      "Now, in a perfect world, we're going to find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president, not long ago, said that he believes Austin's alive.",
      "Our job, in the U.S. government, is to keep pressing and pressing and pressing to find out Austin's location, his disposition, his status and to bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to them as interim authorities. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammed al-Golani, was described by State Department officials as being very pragmatic in those meetings today. But his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorist under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with al Qaeda.",
      "Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we thought - we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So, I understand, of course, their past. What I can tell you right - is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: We came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long - the - I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. With the time that we had on the ground, it seemed to be our best shot. So, we gave it a good, hard look. We're going to review all the information and evidence that we collected, and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability. But really our job is to just to keep searching.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: So, we've had a chance to find various documents or I would even say file folders holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with the interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's going to have to be brought back. It's going to have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints. They may have traces of DNA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with. But I will tell you this, I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. People that are experts at looking at crime scenes. And they did a wonderful job of sweeping it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know back in 2020 you went there at the direction of then President Donald Trump along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: The regime, when we talked to them in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They want - they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL as we call it.",
      "I would say that at some point we came across information and that is highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken that led us to believe that at one point the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they - did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through.

      "A retired Washington, D.C., police officer\u00a0was convicted Monday of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the far-right Proud Boys.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson convicted former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond, who used to supervise the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau, of obstructing justice and making false statements after a trial without a jury.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond was convicted on all four counts. He was charged with leaking information to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "At his bench trial, Lamond testified that he had never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio testified as a witness for Lamond's defense and said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn't receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find the testimony of either Lamond or Tarrio to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the banner burning.",
      "\"It was the other way around,\" she said.",
      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",
      "After the verdict, defense attorney Mark Schamel said it was premature to say if there would be an appeal.",
      "\"It's unbelievably disappointing to see every single thing that Lt. Lamond did viewed through a lens to make it appear to be something other than it was,\" Schamel said outside the courtroom. \"There is nothing disloyal about him at all, and it's a sad day for him.\"",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \"real-time updates\" on the police investigation of the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, was charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. He retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A report by the House Ethics Committee found former Rep. Matt Gaetz paid multiple women, including a 17-year-old girl, for sex.",
    "story": [
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.",

But the remaining three on death row whose sentences are untouched are: Robert Bowers, convicted for the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue; Dylann Roof, convicted of the shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for the Boston Marathon bombing.",
      "While Mr. Biden campaigned on ending capital punishment and the Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions, prosecutors still sought the death penalty in some cases.",
      "Robert Bowers",
      "Bowers, 51, received the death penalty in August 2023 after he was convicted of 63 federal counts for the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Bowers shot and killed 11 worshipers and wounded seven people in the deadliest antisemetic attack in U.S. history.",
      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers. Federal prosecutors said he turned the synagogue into a \"killing ground,\" and police said Bowers told them \"all Jews need to die.\"",
      "The Justice Department said Bowers \"meticulously planned\" the attack based on his antisemitic beliefs.",
      "Dylann Roof",
      "A jury sentenced Roof to death in 2017 for the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, making him the first person ordered to be executed for a federal hate crime. Nine Black parishioners were killed and three were wounded in the attack, which took place during a Bible study.",
      "Prosecutors said before Roof mounted the racially-motivated assault, he posted a manifesto online that used racial slurs and expressed a belief that White people are superior to African Americans. They said Roof wanted to attack Black worshipers to stoke racial conflict.",
      "Roof was convicted of 33 counts in 2016. He appealed his conviction, with his attorneys arguing that Roof was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. But a federal appeals court upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence in 2021.",
      "\"Dylann Roof murdered African Americans at their church, during their Bible-study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered them. He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",

      "Three people were killed and scores more were injured during the attack. Tsarnaev's role in the bombing is not disputed \u2014 his attorneys acknowledged he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two homemade explosive devices near the finish line of the marathon. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",
      "The two brothers attempted to flee Massachusetts following the attack, sparking a four-day manhunt that put Boston and the surrounding areas on lockdown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested by police after he was discovered hiding out in a boat behind a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police during their pursuit of the two brothers.",
      "After appealing his convictions, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld nearly all of them in 2020, with the exception of three, and it invalidated those capital sentences and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the 1st Circuit's decision, arguing a new sentencing proceeding would impose significant burdens on the victims of the 2013 bombing. The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.",

      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",
      "Following the legislation's failure, the Biden administration instituted asylum restrictions that dramatically cut off the flow of immigration. When asked about the timing amid criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration possessed the authority without Congress to act on the border, Mayorkas acknowledged that the administration may have taken the action more quickly if they knew the border deal would be torpedoed.",
      "\"Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly,\" Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "\"We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four, and we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case,\" Mayorkas said.",

      "\"I'm going to be involved,\" Manchin told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The boat's staying here.\"",

After's Musk's criticism, Trump ultimately delievered the final blow.",
      "Musk, who spent $277 million to help Trump win the election and has since become a key member of the president-elect's brain trust, posted dozens of times on his social media platform X opposing the initial government funding measure following its release. Hours later, after Trump intervened, the deal was dead.",

Thomas Massie of Kentucky, said he wouldn't support Johnson for speaker in the new Congress, while questions swirled about his ability to retain enough support to hold onto the gavel.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Roger Carstens, special presidential envoy for hostage affairs,\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens is the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and he joins us now from Amman, Jordan. This was a high risk visit to Damascus, the first since the Assad regime fell. Why was it important to be face to face and go there?",
      "ROGER CARSTENS, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: Margaret, thanks for having me on today. You know, I think it was important because we've been in the area since about the 9th of December, shortly after Damascus fell and the Assad regime left. We flew out to Beirut, later, we restaged to Amman, and our job's been really to cast a wide net to work with partners, allies, NGOs, and even members of the media to try to cast this wide net to search for places that we believe Austin Tice may have been held over the last 12 years. But there's something about getting face to face with the people that have been searching and certainly something about getting face to face with the interim authorities to determine what's seen, to what extent has it- have these sites been cleared, and to maybe find bits of information that you're just not going to get over a phone or over email.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told reporters that you were amazed at the number of secret prisons that Bashar al-Assad had, more than 40 of them. Have those prisons been searched yet, and do you know if journalist Austin Tice was held in them?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I think obviously a lot of them have been, not only by members of the general public, but also by members of this conglomerate of people that are on the hunt and search for not only Austin Tice, but people like Majd Kamalmaz, and other Americans that have gone missing. So if another, I would say, underground prison compound's discovered even tomorrow or three days from now or three weeks from now, at this point, I'm not gonna be shocked. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating. But really the bottom line is that we have to help, and- or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure that we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search been- has been exhaustive. Now in a perfect world, we're gonna find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president not long ago said that he believes Austin's alive. Our job in the U.S. government is to keep pressing and pressing and pressing to find out Austin's location, his disposition, his status, and to bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to them as interim authorities. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammad al-Jolani, was described by State Department officials as being \"very pragmatic\" in those meetings today, but his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorists under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with Al Qaeda. Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So Margaret, I'm- I'm not one of the policy people that render some of these decisions, that's done by people that spend years perfecting this. They're- most of them are lawyers, and I wasn't smart enough to get a law degree. But what I can tell you is that they've treated us well in terms of our search. I've been talking to them for, I wanna say almost, probably nine or 10 days, and they've been helpful in conducting the search. They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we- we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So I understand, of course their- their past. What I can tell you right- is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: You know, Margaret, we had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities. And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites and of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long- the- I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. You know, you can get information from Syria, which to an extent has been a black box in terms of gathering information on Austin, and with all the things, all the, I guess I'd say reports being overlaid, it becomes clear that some places have a higher probability than others. And this, with the time that we had in the ground, seemed to be our best shot. So we- we gave it a good, hard look. We're gonna review all the information and evidence that we collected and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability, but really, our- our job is to just keep searching. You know, it- sometimes it takes a while to determine whether the information is valid or not. And when we g- go to the hard work of crosschecking it, but out of all the sites that we could have looked at, out of the 40 or so prisons that we've identified, and out of the six priority prisons, we went to the one that we felt had the highest chance of giving us some sort of evidence that Austin had been there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prison- prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist? Have you gone through them to look for evidence of Austin and the Virginia doctor you mentioned, Majd Kamalmaz?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So we've had a chance to find various documents, or I would even say file folders, holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's gonna have to be brought back. It's gonna have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints, they may have traces of DNA. So we're still in the, I would say the research phase, but the bottom line is we did find some documents. We're taking a hard look at them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with, but I will tell you this. I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. My office SPEHA is involved because of the diplomatic angle and aspect. So today on the ground, we were working with members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people that are experts at looking at crime scenes, and they did a wonderful job of sweeping it, using all their skills, talents, and capabilities to bear, to- to find the right documents that might make sense to gather the evidence that they felt might give us a- more certainty. But that's- I'll probably just leave it at that. We were with members of the- the law enforcement community, the FBI, and I think they- they were the ones that were able to give us this good look that we otherwise would not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Debra Tice, Austin's mother, sent a letter that became public to the Israeli prime minister, asking him to have his military stop bombing prisons, because she believed her son might be in one of them. Has that bombing complicated the search?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say, to the extent that- of knowledge that I have, no. Now I may not have full- a full picture. You talked earlier about the dis- or the difference between being in Beirut and talking to people on the phones and sending texts, WhatsApp, Signal messages, or being in Amman and doing the same. When you get on the ground and get face to face, you're able to suck in or vacuum in a lot more information. From the information that I've received, the bombing has not really impeded any of the search efforts for Austin. However, I would not want to be too firm about that because there are bits of information that I may not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This wasn't your first trip to Damascus. I know back in 2020, you went there at the direction of then president Donald Trump- Trump, along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then, and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Well, what I can tell you is that the regime, when we talked to them in- in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They- they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL, as we call it. They essentially asked for a lot and said, if we're- the United States were able to deliver everything, they might be willing to have a discussion about this- this person that we're asking about, or to discuss our interests. At that time, they wouldn't even mention his name. So they were not- they were asking for a lot and giving pretty much nothing, and it made for the conversations very frustrating. I would say that at some point we came across information and that's- as highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, that led us to believe that at one point, the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they- did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through. But at one point we- we feel very confident that the regime did detain and have Austin Tice in their custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And before I let you go, the family of Dr. Majd Kamalmaz was told by U.S. intelligence that their father likely died when he was in captivity. Is there a reason for them to continue to hope? Did you discover anything about him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say that if I were in their shoes, I would always want to press to- until I get something that's very conclusive. And my role is- being a part of the U.S. government, my job is to pursue- pursue as rigorously as I can, the truth. And my- I would probably tell the family, and I actually have, I- I've met the family numerous times, I've been in their homes, I've had a chance to- to break bread with them. And I always tell them, no matter what the status is of Majd, we're bringing him home one day. I think if I was in the family's shoes, I'd always have a hope that he was alive. I think the U.S. government's been firm, at least on the information that they've been able to provide about his status. But regardless, we're gonna keep pursuing Majd's case. And one day, at some point, I think we're gonna be able to put that to rest and bring him home.",

      "SEN. MANCHIN: Margaret, it's always good to be with you. You know that, and I enjoy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're always plain spoken, and there's a lot to get to with you. I have to start on this moment of time we are in. There's such uncertainty here on Capitol Hill about whether Congress can come to this new agreement just to keep the lights on and the government funded. After Jan- after- Excuse me, let me start again. There's concern that the government may not come to an agreement to keep the lights on after December 20. This is after Elon Musk and President Elect Trump came out against a bipartisan deal at this 11th hour. Do you think the government's going to shut down?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I don't. I don't think anybody- I think anyone's been here from 2013 remembers- goes back, when it was shut down, all the harm it's done to so many good people, not their fault at all. Innocent people in America, getting harmed because of dysfunction here in Washington. I think what you'll see, Margaret, is, if they're having a hard time getting their legs under them right now, President Trump is out there, but also he wants to hit the ground running. So he's looking, don't put me behind- behind the eight ball, if you will. So they're watching everything very closely. Unfortunately, what you're going to see is a bunch of CRs, probably, you know, right now\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Continuing resolutions.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Continuing resolution, was going to go, okay. That means we're going to continue what we've been doing, and nothing new, nothing different. And that's a very, very poor way of running a government, a very expensive way of running a government, because you should be making some adjustments to make things smoother and better and- and things of that sort. Especially the military. It's very difficult in the military. But they were going to go to March. They wanted to wait. That's what Mike- Mike Johnson, the Speaker, wanted to wait until, I think, after his January 3 election for Speaker, because he's on the thin margin here, and they're just- they're just basically, I mean, just stone cold, they just can't do anything. And that one vote vacate, he's always threatened by just one Republican and say, well, if you don't do what I want, I'm going to go ahead and- and ask for a vacation- a vacate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To oust the speaker.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: To oust the speaker, and he can be threatened with that, and that just shuts everything down. So you only have a two vote threshold over there. I think 20- 220, is what they have, 218. But what gets me- it blows my mind. They won't even think about- I know there'd be moderate centrist Democrats, 10, 15, 20 that would have no problem voting for Mike Johnson to help him, but they're saying, oh no, no, the Democrats will extract too much. Well, if you have 200 Republicans and 10 or 15, or 20 Democrats, I think they'll be more than reasonable just being able to participate, because over there, majority rules.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems, though, the direction is coming not from the elected members, but from the outside. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, was the one who came out against this short term funding deal, and then the President Elect also said, he's- that he's not on board. He's not even in office yet.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think what they looked at as they started getting into the bill, what's- the agreement was made on a continuing resolution, but\u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This 1500 page bill that had other\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, [cross talk] that was agreed upon. There was- that went through all the spending. And you know, Elon's coming in as the new DOGE czar and- and looking at that. So wait a minute, why are you doing that, when it's behind the eight ball before we start? They're- they're looking at all these things here. What they don't\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think these are regional- these are reasonable objections?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No. I can understand where they're coming from. Did I say they're reasonable? No. This Congress, 118th Congress. First of all, Mike Johnson and the Republican leadership in the House has to come to grip that's the worst performing Congress in the history of our country. That means lack of production. And I say that because most of the time there's been about 500 bills that have been passed, and every two year, it's 117th Congress, one of the most productive. 118th was not, they become in charge again. But because of that thing that you went through with Kevin McCarthy, how all that unfolded and what it left them with, they have been just tied in knots and can't get anything through. And they- they will not reach out and work for- with Democrats to continue to have a majority with some bipartisanship. If they can't get over that hump, and if Democrats can't get over that hump, that they've got to work with Republicans, when they're in charge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats did come to a bipartisan agreement on this short term spending deal, and then the President Elect said, no deal.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Right, right. So\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Democrats were working with Republicans on that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, oh no, this last deal that was made here. Mike Johnson shouldn't have done an extension to March, okay, with the CR. We should have finished out. The Senate had all appropriation- 12 appropriation bills done, working with Patty Murray and Susan Collins. Those are two wonderful senators that really worked hard and did their job. And then, boom, nothing happens. And Schumer, for whatever reason, didn't put them on the floor. Should have, we should have had our package altogether. That's all doable. But I would have thought they would have finished out this year, the 118th Congress, and President Trump comes in and starts his new term on the 20th of January. That'll be the 119th Congress. But they're looking at things, they don't want to be strapped with certain things. And they- they- they have a lot of input, let's put it that way, an awful lot of influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- you are an independent and you are independent minded.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Always have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you will object at times to\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014to what the party direction is. Will you support whatever it is that Senate leadership says Democrats should be on board with, if it's to keep the lights on?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Let me make sure you understand. I will never vote to shut down the government. There's no reason. There's- you have no excuse in the world just because it's not the right thing, not perfect enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't that mean that the Senate will just have to swallow whatever it is the House sends up here?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much- pretty much, you're in a situation now, they just want to get out of here and not let the government shutdown and live to fight another day. I can see what's coming now. So my vote, or anybody's vote, right now, I think they're going to come to an agreement. They'll swallow hard, say, let's go home for Christmas. That's what's going to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So whatever it is that gets sent here by the House\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much, whatever it is right now, no matter what they have to do to skinny it down, they're not going to fight. There's not much fight left. Okay? The die has been cast. The election of November pretty much set the die where it's going. So whether you do it now and fight to the death now, it's going to be changing anyway when President Trump brings his new administration in. So they're just trying- President Trump and him are just trying to wield their power right now, and they have that influence with the Republican delegation, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President Elect has now publicly called for the debt ceiling to be dealt with. Not clear if he wants it\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014completely eliminated or lifted. It won't happen? Well, he says it has to be part of this deal before he takes office January 20.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't see the Democrats, basically- and this is going to be from a bipartisan standpoint. You have to have bipartisanship here, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll need 60 votes in the Senate to do this.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's exactly right. And you've got 51 Democrats right now. So if you had all 49 Republicans, you'll need 11 Democrats to raise that debt ceiling. I just don't see getting the votes to do that. My reason for saying that is that's going to have to be, the Republicans do it when they take over with- with the trifecta, if you will. They're saying is, well, this debt we're getting from- from everybody that you've given us to us, and why won't you raise it now so we can go ahead and just do our work? Well, if you're going to do all the thing with DOGE, and you're going to be in charge of all of the rearrangement of government, and trying to look at the waste, fraud and abuse in government, then you shouldn't, maybe have to raise that right now, you know. So- but if you do, you have to justify why you're doing it. I would think that would be their thought process. I'm not sure what they're going to end up with. But I don't see an appetite, and I have not heard an appetite of that being thrown in. Yesterday was the first time we heard about that, and that being thrown in right now to the mix, it's either this or nothing. I don't know how they're going to get over that one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the President Elect understands the political realities that you are talking about, that there aren't the votes?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think he understands- he understands it an awful lot better now than he did in 2016 when he won the first time. So now he's had- he's got- got some experience under him. He understands the process and- but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has with the Republican congregation or delegation, if you will. On the House and the Senate. The Senate has always been more dependent- independent. Senators are independent to a certain extent. The six year term makes you\u00a0 a little bit more independent, so you have that to deal with. But on the house, it's every two years, the whims and wishes of the person that's setting and if they're popular at the White House, makes it almost impossible for them to- to fight back hard, or sit down and work out a really tough agreement that the President wouldn't be on board for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been pushing to make it easier or less burdensome for energy companies to be able to drill, this permitting reform that you've been pushing.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, all types of energy. What I- what we did, Margaret, we did- we did a permitting- we were working on a permitting bill, the John Barrosso, Republican, and I worked together for over a year and a half trying to work through the nuances of trying to say, okay, you have to produce energy that this country needs to operate on our economy, and also be able to defend ourself with our military. That comes from fossil fuels. Renewables is a direction that there's- we'd like to be able to go with technology that will lets- they give us the energy with less carbon emissions. So we looked at everything, and only thing that we said, we came to this permitting bill, how can we produce the energy we need today and continue to invest and not waste money, but invest in technology we- for the energy we want for tomorrow? That's what the bill did. And with that, we had, I mean, a really great bill that came out of our committee, 15 to 4, never happened before. So you would think that it would be a slam dunk. Here we have something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it didn't make it into that short term (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And you would think that President Trump, I was hoping, and I tried everything I could to talk to him and make sure they understood: this bill will allow you to do what you want to do, produce the energy that this country needs. We're producing more energy than anybody in the world. People don't realize that. And you never heard\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Record levels. Record levels of output of oil and natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2014record levels, and you never heard- you never heard President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, and even when she was running for president, until a couple weeks before the election they even acknowledge it. They never did acknowledge that with the IRA, we paid down $230 billion of debt. That was part of the bill. Never talked about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think they were\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: They just couldn't, because it wasn't where they were. They were forced. I wrote the bill, energy portion, and it forced them to have a balanced energy position, and- and then they were just going balls to the wall, to the- with the EVs and everything else. And I told them it was completely wrong. They were way ahead of their skis. We were trying to bring the manufacturing and also the production and- and supply chain with critical minerals back to the United States, or with our free trade agreement countries, there will be reliable supply chains. Right now, they cut everything in half. The rules were absolutely horrible, and I've been fighting them ever since. And I think maybe the President Trump can clean that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't see this latest proposal from you, making it into some 11th hour deal to avoid a government shutdown?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: If the President Trump would- if President Trump would actually say to Mike Johnson, I need that permitting bill. I need that permitting bill to do what I've got to do. If he thinks he wants to raise this- the debt ceiling because he doesn't want to be encumbered about how he wants to operate, I can tell you he's going to be tied in knots wanting to do that, the drill, baby drill, or basically producing more, because you just can't. You have to be able to have leasing permits, and you have to go through a rigmarole thing. And the court systems are so, so onerous, to the point to where it's almost impossible. We cut all that burden out. We basically still are very concerned about the environment, but if you're going to have a problem, tell me up front, don't wait to six years and sue me later. We did judicial reforms, a lot of things that really accelerated us being able to meet the challenges and the energy that we need in the next five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were spotted at that Army-Navy game\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, I was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-speaking to Donald Trump.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I made a point to be there. I was\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking to him about exactly this. Premitting reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I did. Well, he had so much going on. I had a chance just to mention this. I hope you really think about this and- and I'm sure he had so much more- x",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: We'll watch",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: You never know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you reached out to Mr. Trump since last weekend on this?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I haven't, I haven't talked to him. They've got- I think they got a lot on their plate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: This is important though. I hope- I'm going to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were speaking to us on \"Face the Nation\" last January, and we were talking about what was happening and the election cycle, and you were spending time on the campaign trail, you said, 'I love my country too much to vote for Donald Trump\u2026I think it would be very detrimental to my country.' He's the president-elect. Do you think he is detrimental to America?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Here's the thing I've said, you know, I said basically what I had known from the four years before. January 6 was a bridge too far for me and I think everyone knows that. I had a good relationship with him, you know, when he was- when he was the president, and we worked together. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him, and we always got along great, we're very friendly. We used to have disagreements on some things, but you can do that. I've said this, Margaret, I mean it all my- all my heart, when the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray everything you have the president will be successful. And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. Don't worry about well, did you vote or not vote for him? Did you- did- is that in your same party that you're in, or whatever? Forget about that. This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've talked about the need to return to bipartisanship and regular order. Donald Trump is promising to destroy regular order. Upend the system.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I- I have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I have- I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that will not let that happen. They have the chance. They have the power. Here's the thing. We have three branches of government. Bob Byrd used to tell me all the time, he says, Joe, he says, the president's not my boss, he said, and the majority leader is not my boss. The people of West Virginia are my boss. That's who I work for, and for the betterment of our country, as long as you keep that, what's your purpose of being here? And I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart. They're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to and override the parliamentarian and play some rough games. I don't think they will do that. And it only takes five, or it takes four, I'm sorry, it takes four Republican senators, just four, and I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That'll- that'll protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around, and in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's- it's the power of the people. People go to the polls however this thing comes out. So with that being said, they're not going to put themselves in a position. I faulted my Democrat colleagues for always, as soon as they got a chance, they wanted to get rid of the filibuster, and they know I was dead set- I'd do anything I could to stop that from happening, because I thought that was the Holy Grail of keeping democracy. That, and not allowing the reconciliation to be used every day they want to for basically policy-making. That's not what it's for. The reconciliation process was for keeping our finances in check, and we have done a horrible job on finances in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans a once-in-a-generation investment in border security, but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes, using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So with 51 votes, not the 60. You're saying right now, that this is- this is not how the system is supposed to work.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Hold on Margaret, if he's going to have to show the financial connotation, and the cost is- it's costing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And then step two is tax reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds- falls\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah. Well, here I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically when you've given up that you can't work with the other side. They come out of the box that way. So this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the- the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's damaging to the institution.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, it's damaging from the standpoint, if you don't think that you want, you want to do it alone, I'm going to give you a chance to prove to me you won't work with me. I'm not just going to come out the box Margaret. I know you won't work with me, so I'm going to do this. Obviously, I'd put it- put it, and I've said this to President Biden, please put it in the committee of jurisdiction wherever it falls within, whether it's Finance or whether it's",
      "Energy or wherever it may be, and then put the shot clock on us. Say, guys, you got- you got 60 days to make this happen, and if they shut you down, they'll prove to you they don't want to work with you. Then you do what you got to do, but don't come out of the box that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting, that was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. But I guarantee it. We did majority of all that bill. We wrote that bill in my committee, and I guarantee I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I feel, no I feel horrible about that. We had to do it in reconciliation. I felt horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. From the standpoint of more investments, more offshore coming back to the United States for manufacturing, we didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3%, we brought down gas prices from 5 to $3. We did all of that, but the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic, the prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort made this almost unbearable for people to the burden they were carrying. The thing that the IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President Elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. I think there is some things that need to be fixed in it because of how and I've said, you heard me say this many times, when you pass a piece of legislation and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it. So okay, if you're going to put out incentives and tax incentives, it goes to IRS. Well, if the White House says, I want this type of interpretation that makes it very very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. And I have told them many times with President Biden and with Mr. Podesta, these are all good people I know, friendly with very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The energy advisor.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Energy advisor, I said you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way, in spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals we're still depending on China when we're supposed to be weaning ourselves off of China. He can fix that immediately. President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He, and then change, change the bill. It'll be his- it'll be his energy bill, but\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Reprogramming absolutely\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there tax credits for nuclear bio fuels. Do you think parts of- you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think it almost has to. The investments are made, and most of the investments, the majority of the investments, are made in what you would consider red states, Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013They couldn't talk about it, he was talking\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, Can't you just exact- tell what the bill did? They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. Only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything for renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running. Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So I said we're going to produce what we need. We do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now, 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil. You wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill that he can change it. Change the name. It'll be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, just had a memo arguing unfettered U.S. gas exports will harm the U.S. economy.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: What we're talking about unfettered, we don't know where the base is from this standpoint, we are doing about 12 billion cubic feet a day of LNG exports. We've\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Liquefied natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, we've replaced, Margaret, an awful lot of the- this the foreign Russia fuel coming into NATO ally, our country in Europe. We replaced that because of this. But the bottom line is, I don't know where we- the tipping point would be. We're going to be up to about 26 billion cubic feet a day. We're going to double where we are. 2016 we had zero. This is where- how far we come. And with that, we've been able to keep the gas prices fairly reasonable and low in America, there's still two and a half $3 in MCF, million cubic feet of gas, which is extremely, very reasonable. Other countries are paying 12, 13, 14, 15 dollars for the same amount of gas. So we have been awash in gas. I have not seen the final report, and they wanted to start curbing it and say we're going to stop LNG, remember that? A Pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the Biden administration said they were pausing for review\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013So I said, oh no, that doesn't make any sense at all. Give me the report that shows me what the reserves we have left, what the domestic demand is going to be, and if we have the reserve to help our allies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. Okay? My Democrat friends are all so far off the rail. Okay, I love them all. But I say guys- but a lot of them really understand it, they just can't speak it because the base has gone so far, and that's I just I couldn't take it anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in the Senate. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, she is a Republican, but she's also known for being pretty independent\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: She's the best of the best, my dear friend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She said that the next four years are going to be hard. The Trump administration's approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good, or we will primary you.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Thank God for ranked choice voting. Without ranked choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the people of America want to get the best quality, the best character of a human being, they want to represent them so you can continue to enjoy this great domestic, what we call this great democracy ours, which is a representative form. We're still an experimental stage. We're responsible for putting the person that's going to represent us to run this government. You've got to get the best person there. But if the parties shut it down, which they've done, which is Heather, my daughter, we're working on Americans Together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And that Americans Together is basically saying-we're trying to teach every state how you can open your primaries up, how you can look at your districts for gerrymandering, how you can get more people participating. And that's exactly if the democrat and republican party control the primaries, they can control you up here. Because basically you have a hard time winning unless they unless the leadership of both sides, Democrat and Republican, are supporting you, putting their weight and their finances behind you. So they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So I'm going to find somebody else that I can control",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And she's explicitly saying\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013She's telling you exactly the- but they'll not get her because, you know why?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Too many good Alaskans that are Democrats or independents understand the quality of Lisa Murkowski",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who else is going to stand up to the president-elect when they disagree and be willing to say so out loud? Are there other senators up here who will do it?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would hope. You know, my father used to tell me, if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're okay. If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I know it's something, could I work with you and maybe- people have to try a different approach. I mean, I had, I had no problem talking to President Trump when he was, you know, I would just say, I'm not sure that's going to work, and maybe we could try something else. I never just say, Oh, you're wrong. You don't go, you can't start out a conversation that is going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end. If I tell you, that's a pretty good idea, Margaret, could we work on it together, make it a little better?\u00a0 I'm telling you, I can't do what you want me to do. I'll work with you, make it better. You're going to say, Oh no, Joe, it's got to be the way it is. If you're telling me that you're making a political statement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you also serve on armed services. You've said the Afghanistan withdrawal was one of the major failures\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Horrible\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013of the Biden administration. And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he wants the resignation of every single military officer who touched the Afghanistan disaster on his desk by noon on Inauguration Day. Presidents make policy, officers execute it. Do you think there should be retribution, or whatever holding to account means?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I pray to God he doesn't do that. I hope that was just campaign rhetoric. You can't do that. You can't do that, Margaret, basically\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013He says he's going to at noon.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, let's just pray to God he doesn't. You know, things change around here pretty quickly. And the thing I'm saying is this, he's going to be the commander in chief. He's going to give orders, and I guarantee the military will take the orders and take them very well. I am so impressed. And just this amazes me, the military might that we have, but also it's ingrained in them, especially if you ever go through the military academies and people come up through ROTC, and all the people that are really in tune with who we are and the purpose of serving. They're not going to go off it. They do not try to make policy decisions. They will not jump into it. But they're thinking, there are some, well, there's going to be some, you know, that sometimes speak out that maybe shouldn't, but they did, and they've targeted and this and that, and we've had a few generals that have left the ranks because of those reasons. But I can tell you, I can assure you, the military that we have, have followed the private course of what we've dictated our geopolitical course that we're taking, and they've been very good at doing that. The mistakes have been made, even though they see those mistakes. So the people that basically were following orders of the extraction in Afghanistan- first of all, I couldn't believe that we'd just up and leave. I thought we would at least keep Bagram Air Force Base and have that established base, which is an unbelievable value to us, and keeping a little bit of peace in that part of the world. Working with- you can work with the Taliban, whoever you want to over there, but the bottom line, that was a show of force that we had. We could work and help people and do a lot of good from there. We just didn't have to tell them how to live their life and what they should be doing. That's the problem. But when they get out the way they did, that left a mark on us, and it help- it hurt. It reverberated around the world. And the geopolitical unrest that we were kind of on the tinder belt box anyway, it just kind of says, oh, look what's going on. Let's go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken about your friendship with Joe Biden for many, many years. That was tested during this presidency.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When was the last time you spoke with him?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It was before the campaign. It was before the campaign, before he made his decision, before the- probably before, I'm just trying to think, probably before the debate, probably\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: before June.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: His debate, probably it's been a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A consequential debate at the end\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, and I mean, I just, I still think, think he's a very good person. I still like him and Jill and their family just tough. This is a tough situation, okay, but the bottom line is I still, when I spoke, I would still speak to him with respect, and I would do it in a way that I thought would be helpful. I think to be against something means, okay, what do you have better. If I was against what he was doing in energy, I thought I had something better that could help him with. If I was with something of public policy or a policy that they have taken, I'd have to have a better idea. And where I came from had to be more common sense. I had to go home and explain it. And I only think I've told everybody up here. If you want to know, I can tell you exactly. I cannot go home and explain this. And I think you know what that means. I'm not voting for it. I'm telling you up front, so don't be don't be all caught off guard and get excited when you see me get on the floor and vote for something. Oh, Manchin, killed it. No, no. You killed it because you brought it up. You knew you didn't have the votes before you brought it up, but you want to make a show, and you want me to be the bad guy. I know what you're doing, and I've been doing that for far too long, and they should never bring some of the people what they brought for confirmation, which I said, You do not have my vote. Without my vote, you can't pass them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Wall Street Journal has a report about how the White House insulated Joe Biden during his presidency, largely shielding him from the press and not giving him access to lawmakers. They cite you in the article as spending time one on one with President Biden, but in it, you're cited as noticing he lacks stamina and relied on his staff to drive the agenda more than other presidents you had worked with. Do you think that they were concealing the president's decline?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't know how they got that conclusion. I never had a problem sitting and talking with him, and in fact- and the matter of fact, when we start negotiating, he knew that I was against the American rescue plan the way it was coming out, going to reconciliation. And he wanted to talk to me and everything. And when I walked in after he heard that I might be opposing that he's- I said something at 10 o'clock in the morning, by two o'clock, I'm sitting in the Oval Office. And when I came in, hey Jojo, how you doing? We got to talk. So if he says, Hey Jojo, I know things are pretty good. If he's a Joe, come in here. I want to talk to you. I know it's going to be a little bit more- little bit more tense. Depends how he approaches that. Okay, so with that I walked in, you made everybody leave the room, everybody just me and him, and that's when I said, Mr. President, I'm begging you not to do this. You're coming out assuming that Republicans won't work with you, and you were the only one on the stage saying you knew how to make things happen, because you were the deal maker. I know that. I watched it. Now, all of a sudden, you're coming out of the chute, throwing a nuclear bomb. I said, Please don't I said, make them prove they don't work with- with you first. But I said, Let's gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go. I said, Well, okay, and I've always been differential to a president, same as I'm differential to any president that wants to put their staff together. They have someone as long as they're qualified and don't have any nefarious problems that we will find out in a deep dive. That's why you should have FBI reviews. No matter who they are. You need to know. Senators need to know that. I guarantee you they don't want to go into this naked. Democrats and Republicans don't want to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's a mistake for the Trump administration to bypass the FBI background checks.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I can guarantee you one thing, the senators will get their own FBI report. They're not going to let it go. They're not going to make a decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All of them on Armed Services, not just leadership?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN:\u00a0 I would think that everyone- I would think that everyone understands how critical that advise and consent is. That is what you've got, and that's a purpose and a reason for that. But anyway\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind when you say that? Who's background check do you think needs to be reviewed? Who are you concerned about?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I mean, you know Tulsi. I know Tulsi Gabbard. I like Tulsi as a person. I just don't know all the other things have happened over the years. You follow me? But I knew when she was first here in Congress, and I came here as a senator and- and we had, you know, because she was moderate, very modern, centrist, we had a lot in common back then, when we could talk about different things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Pete Hegseth.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pete, I don't know well. I don't know Pete that well. And you want to make sure he has the qualifications, and if the President thinks he does, I would, you know, I don't have a bit of problem. Once the presidents pick their team, I'll tell you the reason why. That's will and pleasure. They come and go with the President. They're not hanging over to another president who has to inherit these people. So you always when I was governor, I used to go tell the state senator you might not know the people I'm bringing on board. Do your- do your do your investigation. If you find nothing that they've not done, they're a good character, might not be somebody you know or you like, but they have the qualifications. I have faith in them. Give me a chance to work with him, if not throw us both out. That's how I look at it. So anytime a president asked me something, I said, so I finally just had to tell President Biden, I said, Are you asking me as your friend and as my president to get on the American rescue plan? And he said, Yes. I'll do it one time. That was it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. How are you going to influence politics from outside the Senate? And do you regret not running for president yourself?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would have loved to have had a platform that I could speak, which I think is pretty centrist common sense, where most people in America are, and maybe I could have done this. Could I have won or not? Who knows? Could I put a team together that I could show that could responsibly govern, taking consideration that you have to be fiscally responsible and you can be socially compassionate, but you can run it- run your household, and you can run your country with compassion, but also being responsible. And right now I'm saying we're throwing caution to the wind on both of those. So with that, I could have brought that to a level in a discussion that maybe bring the extremes back. You know, the extremes have never run the parties, but the extremes are running the parties now and then they're closing and shutting everything down, open the process up. I had to fight when I was secretary of state of West Virginia to have open primaries. I wanted to basically- independents couldn't vote in a Democratic primary in West Virginia when I became Secretary of State, that's because we already had all the Democrats at 75% Democrat state. They said, why do we have to do anything? We don't need those people. I said, You mean you're going to sit back and allow the Republicans open the primary up, to allow an\u00a0 independent come in, says, I'd like to vote, and they're going to say, well, you don't even vote for the Republicans because the Democrats won't allow you. I finally got to change that. But you have to open this process up. If you want a representative form of democracy to work in this experiment of 240 years, then let's do it the right way and let people participate and have some say, and have a better quality of candidate or more selection, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Manchin,",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: There's a lot more. Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more. There's more we can talk about.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I heard that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The boat's gonna stay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you going to use the boat for?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I got on the boat. Everybody wants a boat, so yeah, and we're all gonna come down. I promise you that we'll do that. But here's what. Last night, we had a big dinner with D's and R's, 5 D's and five R's. And I said, guys, the only thing I can tell you is I'm leaving. I'm leaving, but I'm not going that far away, because I want you all to have a place. And we did so many good things in that boat. We got so many discussions. We got through so many problems. And I said, you know, you get four D's, four R's whatever. Only thing I'm going to tell you, the boat will be available to you, but you've got to bring a person from the other party when you come. So if you want to bring five of your D's down, or you'll be five R's, then bring five D's, and we'll take care of the rest. I'll have you down there, and we'll come down. And once I get through the gate and get on the boat, nobody can bother. Nobody hears them, nobody you never heard any conversations or any bills came out of that boat. But a lot did, and we had a lot of good friendships came out that boat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that's going to be possible in this environment?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I'm trying. I'm trying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That it's not too toxic for Democrats to work with Donald Trump?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's never too toxic for people to get together and enjoy a little vibration, vibration and vibration. (laughing) Enjoy, enjoy getting together. And I tell you this on the boat, the most beautiful thing we do, no matter what we do that night, we have, we have some- some- some refreshments. We have some food. But before we leave, we always put Lee Greenwood on, \"Proud to be an American,\" and we all stand up and hug each other, I can tell you that. So if I can keep that alive, I've done something.",

      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you. This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did. Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines. Won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the President's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page. Because with narrow majorities, we've got to work together, and that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Marc Short, who was the Director of Legislative Affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025. What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, want to use the budget reconciliation process that's still -still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of the Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business, having access to capital. So, I think we're on the same page, and I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REP. HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that year when we last year in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security, for an all the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on, we are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor as well as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on US investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies. Your Democrat colleague Rosa DeLauro insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual-use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the America's- America's national security, but striking that balance has been difficult, but I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people, a majority of members, clearly wanted a simple, straightforward continuing resolution, and not of what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR. So, I think President- I mean, Speaker Johnson, did a good job coming back around from that focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast, farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with majority leader Thune, on how we would tackle reconciliation, to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. It's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing Chair of House Financial Services was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders. Take a listen.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "REP. PATRICK MCHENRY: For us to have no women chairs of committees is a huge mistake and really an unfortunate thing, because we have powerful, smart, capable, tenacious Republican women, that are capable of leading big committees and doing major things.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REP. HILL: Well that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica de la Cruz of Texas, and we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan our conference- our conference Chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from South Florida, joining our committee. They will be active leaders in financial services policy making.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly. I know you've been trying to restrict captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "FRENCH HILL: Well, we need the United States to be very active work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime, as it relates to all the people murdered, killed in prison, tortured in the- from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that, but it needs to be stopped. But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict captagon and cut off the funding, because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that. Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well. A source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow, the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former congressman Matt Gaetz alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. last month on this program, you said 'it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.' Do you still object?",
      "FRENCH HILL: That's not- well I don't know that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are- they have released documents before, but I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution, because you open up a Pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025? Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. TONY GONZALES: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after President elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line. Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid March. You were one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's pretty simple, my- my constituents were against the CR just as much as I was against the CR. This- it's been a tough week, though. It started with a tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I've worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I've been working with others to get that done. I think that's important. And then in the house, of course, we have this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1500 page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in DC, and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills. You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though he was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is I think CRs are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Right, that's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, 'Hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job.' We've ran that play before\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Yeah.",
      "REP. GONZALES: In my eyes, you use Christmas, you use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, 'let's get it done now.' There's also a bigger danger to this too, is if we're not funding the government long term, now all of a sudden you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well. So basically, it was- it was a vote on my end to say, 'let's do our job.'",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those, those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the CR, but I want to ask you about the dynamic here, because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the Speaker of the House. At- what role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels like as if Elon Musk is our prime minister. And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -unelected.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Unelected, But I mean, he has a voice, and I think a lot of the large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these- a 1500 page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order. The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over the spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing? They were- they were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united, and it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal. Do you support him if- he's standing for reelection should he still lead the party if you're saying he was leaning in the wrong direction with a 15 page, initial, funding deal?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yeah, and I do, I do support Speaker Johnson, I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats in the house, right? So that's a tough job to begin with, but the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with the, you know, with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members, to find a solution, just goes to prove that he's found a way. But they're also- this can't be the norm. This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the CR is, this cannot be the norm, that we have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills. Homeland Security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention. Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July, and there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81 year old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public. Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I wasn't aware. I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining an age, like a lot of members do. And sadly, you know, some of these members wait until it's too long to things have gone too far\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I think it's- maybe, I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it. I'd say on the other side of the aisle is the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side, you know, with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time. I think this goes- gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job, and if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there, and apparently it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows. I need to get to the border, because that is what 800 miles of the border\u2013",
      "REP. GONZALES: -that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your district. Border patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low. Does that mean coming into office that essentially, the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Oh no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has has started to do some things right. The Trump administration is going to do everything right in this manner. And I'll tell you why, this is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat, the worldwide threats to homeland, to our homeland. I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I'll share some of the open source stuff. In Syria, a lot of us are rooting for a free Syria. Free Syria, it brings a lot of opportunities for- for stability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy, he imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully. Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going? Let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists? Of course not. But do we know who these people are, and who- are they coming to our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about, you want to block travel from Muslim majority countries? Like the Trump team is talking about.",
      "REP. GONZALES: I want the president- I want the President to enforce the laws that we have on the books. That simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, those aren't laws on the books. Refugees are, except in the United States of America.",
      "REP. GONZALES: And they should be right. I want us to follow our laws right. And if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes. And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming. We want people to come and live the dream- those that are fleeing political persecution, but we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",

      "Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he's \"alarmed\" by the \"heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City,\" as the the insurance executive's killing in midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4 has prompted scattered celebration on social media \u2014 and lionizing of the man charged in the deadly shooting.",
      "\"It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspect, faces federal charges including murder. Investigators' working theory of the motive is animosity toward the health care industry. On social media, support for the suspect has materialized surrounding grievances toward perceived inequalities in the insurance and health care systems.",
      "Mayorkas said the department sees a \"wide range of narratives\" that \"drive some individuals to violence.\"",
      "\"We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances in the language of violence, accompanying or being a part of those narratives,\" Mayorkas said. \"it's something that we're very concerned about \u2014 that is a heightened threat environment.\"",

    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",

    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "The ominously nicknamed invasive species was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and verified two reports of the hornet. Efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",
      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

      "World coal use is set to reach an all-time high in 2024, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, in a year all but certain to be the hottest in recorded history.",
      "Despite calls to halt humanity's burning of the filthiest fossil fuel driving climate change, the energy watchdog expects global demand for coal to hit record highs for the third year in a row.",
      "Scientists have warned that planet-warming greenhouse gases will have to be drastically slashed to limit global heating to avoid catastrophic impacts on the Earth and humanity.",
      "Earlier in December, the European Union's climate monitor Copernicus said 2024 was \"effectively certain\" to be the hottest on record \u2014 eclipsing the mark set just last year.",
      "Published on Wednesday, the IEA's \"Coal 2024\" report does, however, predict the world will hit peak coal use in 2027 after topping 8.77 billion tons this year.",
      "But that would be dependent on China, which for the past quarter-century has consumed 30 percent more coal than the rest of the world's countries combined, the IEA said.",
      "China's demand for electricity was the most significant driving force behind the increase, with more than a third of coal burnt worldwide carbonized in that country's power plants.",
      "Though Beijing has sought to diversify its electricity sources, including a massive expansion of solar and wind power, the IEA said China's coal demand in 2024 will still hit 4.9 billion tones \u2014 itself another record.",
      "Increasing coal demand in China, as well as in emerging economies such as India and Indonesia, made up for a continued decline in advanced economies.",
      "However that decline has slowed in the European Union and the United States. Coal use there is set to decline by 12 and five percent respectively, compared with 23 and 17 percent in 2023.",
      "With the imminent return to the White House of Donald Trump \u2014 who has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" \u2014 many scientists fear that a second Trump presidency would water down the climate commitments of the world's largest economy.",
      "Coal mining also hit unprecedented levels by topping nine billion tons in output for the first time, the IEA said, with top producers China, India and Indonesia all posting new production records.",
      "The energy watchdog warned that the explosion in power-hungry data centers powering the emergence of artificial intelligence was likewise likely to drive up demand for power generation, with that trend underpinning electricity demand in coal-guzzling China.",
      "The 2024 report reverses the IEA's prediction last year that coal use would begin declining after peaking in 2023.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate change forum in Dubai last year, nations vowed to transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "But its follow-up this year ended in acrimony, with experts warning that the failure to double down on that landmark pledge at COP29 in Azerbaijan risked jeopardizing efforts to fight climate change.",

    "summary": "New analysis techniques and decades-old research helped NASA scientists identify an unusual black hole in a distant galaxy.",
    "story": [
      "NASA researchers combined years of data and new imaging techniques to learn more about a \"tipped over\" black hole that is moving in an unexpected way.",
      "The black hole is located in a galaxy called NGC 5084. Researchers have been aware of the galaxy for years, NASA said in a news release.",
      "New analysis techniques developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California helped researchers see four long plumes of plasma emanating from the galaxy. Most galaxies don't have plumes, and when they do, only one or two are present. The plumes suggested the galaxy might house a supermassive black hole, NASA said. Spotting both pairs, which formed an \"X\" shape, led researchers to focus more on the area.",
      "Using archived data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Telescope based in Chile, researchers found that the galaxy also had a \"small, dusty inner disk\" rotating at the center of the galaxy, again suggesting a black hole there. Even more surprisingly, both the disk and black hole were rotating at a 90-degree angle relative to the rest of the galaxy, meaning both features are essentially \"lying on their sides,\" NASA said.",
      "\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" said research scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff, who will also publish a paper about the discovery, in the news release. \"Putting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"",
      "It's not clear what caused the change in the galaxy. It may have collided with another galaxy and formed a chimney of superheated gas, creating the X-shaped plasma plumes. Further research will have to be conducted to learn more about the circumstances.",
      "\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" said Pamela Marcum, an astrophysicist at Ames and co-author on the discovery, in the news release. \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are stuck, but not stranded, at the International Space Station after launching into space in June.",
    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station. That won't happen until late March at the earliest so NASA and SpaceX can have more time to finish a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission, NASA said.",
      "Have other astronauts been stuck in the International Space Station before?",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two cosmonauts' six-month stay on the space station was unexpectedly extended to a year after their Soyuz ship became disabled. A replacement had to be launched up to the trio so they could return to Earth in 2023.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:26:37 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says he's optimistic the Trump administration will support the space agency's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",

    "story": [
      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",

      "Last July, panic erupted on an American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Miami after a laptop battery in a carry-on bag ignited.",
      "\"It was absolute chaos. It truly felt like every man for themselves. And it was terrifying,\" said Shilpa Patel, a passenger on the flight. \"I don't know if we're going to explode. All I know is I need to get out and I need to survive.\"",

      "A survey of more than 800 flight attendants conducted by UL found that 87% are concerned about lithium battery risks on airplanes, and more than a third believe airlines should do more to ensure passenger safety. While the FAA requires airlines to include general safety information in preflight announcements, those warnings often don't address the specific risk of\u00a0battery fires.",
      "\"It's a balance we probably need to do a better job striking with the airlines,\" said Ben Supko, who oversees hazardous materials safety for the FAA. \"Passengers don't fully understand how serious the risk is.\"",
      "Supko said passengers need to monitor devices during a flight and immediately notify the crew if a device becomes warm, discolors, or bulges. Passengers are also warned not to pack lithium batteries\u00a0in checked luggage, as fires in the cargo hold are harder to extinguish.",

      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, appears to have been given new life after an appeals court on Monday determined its rules can be enforced as the case proceeds. The law requires small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of the Jan. 1, 2025 deadline, although businesses that started in 2024 were given 90 days to register.",

      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",

      "Prosecutors said in court they have been assured by federal prosecutors that the state case will move forward prior to the federal trial.",

      "\"He is being treated like a human ping pong ball\"",
      "Friedman Agnifilo said Mangione is facing two proceedings, one of them with the possibility of the death penalty, and she told the court she's \"very concerned\" about Mangione's ability to get a fair trial, saying statements made by government officials have been prejudicial.",
      "\"He is a young man and he is being treated like a human ping pong ball, between two warring jurisdictions here. These federal and state prosecutors are coordinating with one another at the expense of him. They have conflicting theories in their indictments, and they are literally treating him like he is some sort of political fodder, like some sort of spectacle,\" Friedman Agnifilo said. \"He was on display for everyone to see in the biggest staged perp walk I've ever seen in my career. It was absolutely unnecessary. He's been cooperative with law enforcement. He had been in custody for over a week. He waived extradition.\"",
      "Friedman Agnifilo also took issue with Mayor Eric Adams' presence when Mangione was returned to New York was \"political.\"",
      "\"There was absolutely no need whatsoever, and frankly the mayor should know more than anyone of the presumption of innocence that he too is afforded when dealing with his own issues, and frankly I submit he was trying to detract from those issues by making a spectacle of Mr Mangione,\" Friedman Agnifilo said. \"He's not a symbol. He's somebody who's afforded the right to a fair trial. He's innocent until proven guilty. And the mayor was talking to jurors, future potential jurors, those are the people that elected him that he is talking to, and calling this man a terrorist... . I just want to make a record of this and put everyone on notice that this has to stop, and my client is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.\"",

Mayor Adams' priority is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 public safety, and he has repeatedly spoken about how social media is fueling the radicalization of our youth. Critics can say all they want, but showing up to support our law enforcement and sending the message to New Yorkers that violence and vitriol have no place in our city is who Mayor Eric Adams is to his core,\" Adams spokesperson Kayla Mamelak Altus said.",

    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond was convicted on all four counts. He was charged with leaking information to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "At his bench trial, Lamond testified that he had never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio testified as a witness for Lamond's defense and said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn't receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find the testimony of either Lamond or Tarrio to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the banner burning.",
      "\"It was the other way around,\" she said.",
      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",

      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \"real-time updates\" on the police investigation of the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, was charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. He retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.",

      "Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they own, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, which is the day before media reports of a potential transaction began to circulate. The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years.

      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool.

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A report by the House Ethics Committee found former Rep. Matt Gaetz paid multiple women, including a 17-year-old girl, for sex.",
    "story": [
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.",

      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers.

He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",

But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",

      "Along with his two older brothers, Juan David and Jorge Luis, Ochoa turned himself in to Colombian authorities in the early 1990s under a deal in which they avoided being extradited to the U.S.",
      "The three brothers were released from prison in 1996, but Ochoa was arrested again three years later for drug trafficking and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 people as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy.",
      "He was the only suspect in that group who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and a 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Ochoa's name has faded from popular memory as Mexican drug traffickers take center stage in the global drug trade.",
      "But the former member of the Medellin cartel was recently depicted in the Netflix series Griselda, where he first fights the plucky businesswoman Griselda Blanco for control of Miami's cocaine market and then makes an alliance with the drug trafficker, played by Sofia Vergara.",
      "Ochoa is also depicted in the Netflix series Narcos, as the youngest son of an elite Medellin family that is into ranching and horse breeding and cuts a sharp contrast with Escobar, who came from more humble roots.",

      "\"Settlers make a security argument, that Israel is safer with the settlements,\" I said.",
      "\"The security argument is completely bogus,\" Sharon replied. \"The settlements are not a security asset; they are a security burden, because defending, protecting scores of civilians, deep in densely populated Palestinian territory, is one hell of a burden for the military.\"",
      "He added, \"The best way to ensure Israel's security is to have partnership with the state or state-like entity that has an interest in preventing precisely this kind of hostile activity.\"",
      "David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \"We have ideologues on both sides of this equation that are determined to thwart any accommodation.\"",
      "In 2013, Makovsky was part of the team trying to negotiate a peace deal. That failed proposal, and two others, would have seen Palestinians keep about 95% of the West Bank.",
      "But today, with the increasing number of settlements \u2013 blue dots on the map, some far from the Green Line \u2013 it may be even more complicated to determine borders in a two-state solution.",
      "The negotiations changed under Donald Trump, said Makovsky: \"Until Trump, all of the U.S. peace approaches were similar. Under Trump, working with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he doesn't want to pick and choose which settlements make it and which don't. So, the prime minister convinced the president that every single settlement is called Israel. Now that creates an impossible situation of Swiss cheese. Any Palestinian entity is now going to be dotted with settlements.\"",
      "Now, settlers may have another ally with sway in President-elect Trump's nominee to be the next ambassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee, who has said he's open to annexing parts of the West Bank.",

      "But there is historical precedent for evacuating settlements. Almost 20 years ago, the Israeli government advocated that leaving Gaza was a path to peace.",
      "According to Makovsky, \"2005 is for the settlers their Waterloo, their defeat.\" That's when Israel removed all 8,000 settlers from Gaza.",
      "Back then, I profiled a 17-year-old who was being forced to leave Gush Katif, her settlement in Gaza. Nineteen years later, settlements are still front-page news. \"Yes, that's how it is in Israel,\" said Rachel Yechieli Gross. Today, she is now a mom with three kids, and no longer lives in a settlement.",
      "I asked, \"The fact that you left your home, your settlement as a teenager, shows that settlements can be closed. Might that be a step toward peace?\"",
      "\"After October 7th, I'm not so sure anymore, because I really believed that there could be change,\" said Gross. \"But I don't feel that anymore.\"",
      "Makovsky blamed the terror group Hamas, which he said \"has really led to the growth of the Israeli right. If people in Israel thought that a Palestinian state was Costa Rica, they would line up to sign, 'cause they want to end the conflict. They just want to be safe. But if they feel a Palestinian state is a mini-Iran, you can't find enough people in the phone booth.\"",

      "\"I wouldn't leave willingly, because I'm raising my family here and I've, you know, built my dream home,\" she said. \"Why does the peace agreement have to be at my expense, to give up my home?\"",

      "Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven't publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy.",
      "Authorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. He described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.",

      "\"He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,\" said the statement.",
      "The group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: \"At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.\"",

      "\"A church community lives in joyful and fraternal harmony to the extent that its members walk in the life of humility, renouncing evil thinking and speaking ill of others,\" Francis said. \"Gossip is an evil that destroys social life, sickens people's hearts and leads to nothing. The people say it very well: Gossip is zero.\"",
      "\"Beware of this,\" he added.",
      "By now Francis' annual Christmas address to the priests, bishops and cardinals who work in the Vatican Curia has become a lesson in humility \u2014 and humiliation \u2014 as Francis offers a public dressing down of some of the sins in the workplace at the headquarters of the Catholic Church.",
      "In the most biting edition, in 2014, Francis listed the \"15 ailments of the Curia,\" in which he accused the prelates of using their Vatican careers to grab power and wealth. He accused them of living \"hypocritical\" double lives and forgetting \u2014 due to \"spiritual Alzheimer's\" \u2014 that they're supposed to be joyful men of God.",

      "France's anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school near Paris four years ago, a horrific death that shocked the country.",
      "Paty, 47, was killed by an Islamic extremist outside his school on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police.",
      "Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November were accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place.",
      "The 540-seat courtroom was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. Heavy surveillance was in place, with more than 50 police officers guarding the proceedings.",
      "Seated in the front row was Paty's 9-year-old son, accompanied by family members. As the lead judge, Franck Zientara, delivered sentences one after the other, emotions in the room ran high.",
      "\"I am moved, and I am relieved,\" said Ga\u00eblle Paty, Samuel Paty's sister, as she addressed a crowd of reporters after the verdict. \"Hearing the word 'guilty' \u2014 that's what I needed.\"",
      "\"I spent this week listening to a lot of rewriting of what happened, and it was hard to hear, but now the judge has stated what really happened, and it feels good,\" she added, her voice breaking as tears filled her eyes.",
      "Families of the accused reacted with gasps, cries, shouts, and ironic clapping, prompting the judge to pause multiple times and call for silence.",
      "\"They lied about my brother,\" shouted one relative. Another woman, sobbing, exclaimed, \"They took my baby from me,\" before being escorted out by police officers.",
      "The seven-judge panel met or went above most of the terms requested by prosecutors, citing \"the exceptional gravity of the facts.\"",
      "Na\u00efm Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, friends of the attacker, were convicted of complicity in murder and sentenced to 16 years in prison each. Neither can be paroled for two thirds of their term, about 10 years. Boudaoud was accused of driving the attacker to the school, while Epsirkhanov helped him procure weapons.",
      "Brahim Chnina, 52, the Muslim father of the schoolgirl whose lies sparked the events leading to Paty's death, was sentenced to 13 years for association with a terrorist enterprise. Prosecutors had sought 10 years for him.",
      "Abdelhakim Sefrioui, a Muslim preacher, was given 15 years for organizing a hate campaign online against Paty.",
      "The shocking death of the 47-year-old teacher left an indelible mark on France, with several schools now named after him.",
      "The trial had begun in late November. The defendants were accused of assisting a perpetrator or organizing a hate campaign online in lead-up to the murder.",
      "At the time of the attack, there were protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists.",
      "The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty's killing reinforced the French state's commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life.",
      "Chnina's daughter, who was 13 at the time, claimed that she had been excluded from Paty's class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020.",
      "Chnina sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that \"this sick man\" needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina's daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question.",
      "Paty was teaching a class mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom.",
      "An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher's head in a post on social media. Police later fatally shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed.",
      "Chnina's daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet.",
      "Sefrioui, the preacher on trial, had presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role. He had filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a \"thug\" multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media.",
      "Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty's family.",
      "\"It's something that really shocks the family,\" lawyer Virginie Le Roy said ahead of the verdicts. \"You get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Apologies are pointless, they won't bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us,\" Le Roy said. \"We haven't had many explanations of the facts.\"",

      "Krish Patel, M.D., is director of lymphoma research at Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee. (Sarah Cannon Research Institute\u00a0)",
      "A: In the field of lymphomas, we see growing momentum for therapies that use the patient's own immune system to fight their cancer, such as CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies.",
      "These are treatments that are now being studied and are making an impact earlier in the disease course, including one now being studied as the very first treatment a patient might receive for their lymphoma.",

      "A: Every year we are improving the curative treatment options we have for specific types of lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is the most common lymphoma we see.",
      "We are also gradually becoming better able to offer these treatments closer to \u2013 or in \u2013 patients\u2019 homes and communities, so they can receive the best care as close to home as possible.",
      "\"Every year, we are improving the curative treatment options we have for specific types of lymphomas.\"",
      "I believe that in 2025, we will continue to see more advancement in immunotherapies, development of more targeted therapies (including oral medicines), and hopefully soon the approval of next generations of immunotherapies that may work for patients who have already received today's immunotherapies but need more treatment options.",
      "A: It has changed and evolved dramatically. A decade ago, care for lymphomas was primarily chemotherapy-based. Now, we are shifting rapidly away from chemotherapies in some types of lymphomas in favor of immunotherapies and targeted oral therapies that lead to excellent long-term outcomes for patients, with fewer side effects than historical treatments.",
      "As 2024 comes to an end, experts are looking back and reflecting on the discoveries and advances that have been made in the field of cancer treatment and prevention. (iStock)",
      "A: We think of lymphomas as diseases of aging for most patients. Some patients may have select risk factors, such as being on specific immunosuppressants or having exposure to very specific industrial chemicals.",

      "A: In 2024, truly personalized medicine is possible, from mutation testing to direct targeted therapy to what a cancer needs to grow \u2014 as well as being able to provide many HR+ breast cancer patients with curative chemotherapy through personalized risk stratification assays.",
      "\"I anticipate seeing more targeted agents in 2025 and the approval of antibody drug conjugates in curative early breast cancer,\" said Hamilton (not pictured). (iStock)",

      "How is beef tallow made?",

      "The fat is harvested, ground and rendered before it is melted down with herb-infused olive oil, and is then whipped, cooled and jarred, she said.",

      "\"It's not the back fat or other types of fat that you might find on your steak,\" Wilmoth said. \"It's a very specific fat \u2026 our ancestors recognized that this fat was special.\"",
      "\"It has a higher amount of nutrients than all the other fats in the animal,\" she went on. \"It's very creamy and white in texture. It doesn't have a weird smell or taste.\"",
      "This specific fat is where nutrients, including vitamins D and A, are stored, according to Wilmoth.",
      "Potential benefits for the skin",
      "\"Our skin is an organ,\" Wilmoth said. \"That's why it's so important that anything we put on our skin should be something we're really thinking about carefully.\"",

      "Dr. Brendan Camp, a New York-based dermatologist, agreed that beef tallow is \"generally well-tolerated\" by most skin types.",

      "For the skeptics who may think using fat on the face can be pore-clogging, one expert noted that tallow's fatty acid profile is \"similar to our own skin\u2019s make-up.\" (Hearth and Homestead)",
      "\"As an emollient,\u00a0beef\u00a0tallow\u00a0fills in cracks and crevices in the skin that contribute to a rough texture,\" he said to Fox News Digital.",

I just reported how a data breach at a physician-led\u00a0vein center exposed almost half a million people\u2019s data to hackers. And now, another health care data breach has come to light and this one affects even more people.

During this time, an unknown hacker gained access to the platform and pulled data from provider-patient communications. ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",
      "Phreesia, which bought ConnectOnCall in October 2023, discovered the breach on May 12 and says it jumped into action right away. The company brought in external cybersecurity pros to lock down the platform and reported the breach to federal law enforcement.",
      "\"On May 12, 2024, ConnectOnCall learned of an issue impacting ConnectOnCall and immediately began an investigation and took steps to secure the product and ensure the overall security of its environment,\" the company\u00a0revealed in a press release.",

Unlike financial breaches, where compromised accounts can be frozen or replaced, health information is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals may exploit this data to commit\u00a0identity theft, including obtaining prescription drugs fraudulently or filing false insurance claims.",
      "Plus, the detailed health information exposed \u2013 such as diagnoses, treatments and medications \u2013 can be used for targeted\u00a0phishing attacks. Scammers could exploit victims\u2019 medical histories to create highly convincing schemes, increasing the likelihood of success.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2) Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats.

Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ConnectOnCall health data breach highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures within the health care sector, where the stakes are often much higher than in other industries. With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud.

      "Unless you go completely off the grid digitally \u2014 no internet, online accounts or smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid leaving a digital footprint. Most companies collect and share your personal information, which ends up in the hands of data brokers and people-search websites that aggregate and sell it to even more third parties.",
      "Data brokerage is a\u00a0$245.8 billion industry that profits off your personal information at the expense of your privacy and security. Some data brokers have even been caught\u00a0intentionally selling information to scammers.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",

But taking just a few minutes to review your security practices can save you from a world of trouble. Don't wait until it\u2019s too late to protect yourself and your loved ones. Neglecting basic security like two-factor authentication, reusing passwords or shopping on untrustworthy websites can leave you exposed. Using finance apps that share your data, like allowing data brokers to profit off your personal information, also increases your risks of experiencing fraud and identity theft. By staying vigilant, you can protect both your finances and your loved ones.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 10:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network can help ensure your information remains security and your privacy remains intact. Kurt the CyberGuy explains.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Have you ever felt a little uneasy while browsing the internet, wondering who might be watching your online activities?",
      "Well, let me introduce you to a handy tool that can put your mind at ease: the virtual private network, or VPN.",
      "Whether you're working from home, streaming your favorite shows or just exploring the web, a VPN can help ensure that your data stays secure and your privacy intact. So, let\u2019s dive into why having a VPN at home is a smart move.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "A VPN on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A virtual private network, or VPN, encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through a server in a different location than your own. VPNs make it appear that you are connecting to the internet from whichever location the server is hosted in rather than your actual location.",
      "When you first connect to a network using a VPN, your device will establish a secure connection with the VPN server, and your device's IP address will appear as the VPN server, meaning that only your internet service provider will see that you're connecting to a VPN server. Normally, when you connect to a website, the website or any online services you visit can see your device's technical information, including location-sensitive data such as IP addresses.",
      "THE BEST VPNS FOR BROWSING THE WEB IN 2024",
      "Why would you want a VPN at home?",
      "While your home internet connection is more secure than a\u00a0public Wi-Fi connection, VPNs still provide a greater sense of privacy and access to content that might be restricted due to location. Here are 10 reasons I have for getting a home VPN.",
      "Online communication can be hit or miss when it comes to security. Some messaging services, such as Whatsapp, use end-to-end device encryption, which helps keep your messages secure, but other messaging services, such as Skype, don't use end-to-end encryption. If you use a VPN with any communication apps, then all your connection and messaging data between your device and the VPN server is fully encrypted.",
      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Online content and services like Netflix are restricted to specific geographic regions. This content can range from news websites to video streaming platforms and social media apps. Using a VPN at home can appear to be using the internet from another location, allowing you to access restricted services.",
      "Sometimes, an internet service provider (ISP) will slow down bandwidth or certain online activities. One of the most common reasons networks do this is to manage network congestion, especially during peak hours. You might notice that your home internet connection slows down at night, when everyone is home from work, or it might slow down when summer vacation starts. Using a VPN will prevent your service provider from identifying the type of web content you are accessing, making it impossible for your ISP to slow down your traffic.",
      "A VPN also keeps your internet activity private from Wi-Fi network admins, who, if technically skilled enough, can figure out which websites you've visited. If you're worried about the Wi-Fi admin of your office, hotel, school or other public place having access to your browsing history, a VPN is the perfect solution for you. When it comes to your own home Wi-Fi network, a VPN will keep your browsing history private from other household members.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers deploy large-scale cyberattacks to observe network activity and steal your information. These attacks are particularly prevalent on public Wi-Fi networks, which often have minimal security measures, but they can also target secured networks. Using a VPN can significantly enhance your security by providing encryption for your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and read your data. This encryption is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi, as it secures your information from potential eavesdroppers.",
      "Additionally, a VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server, helping to protect your identity online and making it harder for attackers to target you directly. However, it is essential to understand that while a VPN adds a layer of security,\u00a0it is not a comprehensive solution against all cyber threats.",
      "A VPN does not prevent malware infections or\u00a0phishing attacks, so you must still employ\u00a0strong antivirus software and exercise caution when clicking on links or downloading files.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Furthermore, not all VPNs are created equal; some may have vulnerabilities or questionable privacy practices. It is crucial to choose a\u00a0reputable provider that uses strong encryption and has a clear no-logging policy.",
      "There's a myriad of reasons, ranging from political to economic, that countries use to justify censoring certain apps and websites. It can be incredibly frustrating for citizens and anyone traveling to that country to lose access to email, social media, news websites and other tools that keep us connected to the world around us. I've used VPNs extensively while traveling to ensure that I can always view my most important websites, no matter where I actually am. As I've mentioned, a VPN can mask your IP address and make it appear as traffic from a different country, allowing you to bypass online geographic restrictions.",
      "One of the best reasons to have a VPN at home is that it can help you save money and find better deals while online shopping. Some online retailers change their prices depending on users' locations. However, when using a VPN while shopping for plane tickets, hotels or gifts, it's possible to\u00a0find cheaper prices just by changing your location.",
      "It's no longer the work of sci-fi. We do know that governments, nearly all of them, surveil their citizens. A VPN will add a layer of privacy, making it significantly more difficult for governments to detect your web traffic. Even if you feel that you have nothing to hide, online privacy is something you should feel free to exercise.",
      "Much like governments, your ISP can surveil your online activity with ease. While most ISPs claim that they don't sell your browsing data, they are often allowed through contracts with marketing agencies to give your data away for free to advertise to you. The simplest way to hide your online activity from your ISP is to use a VPN. When using a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see which websites you visit or which apps you use.",
      "Image of a Google search on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW VPNS SHIELD YOUR IDENTITY AND SECURE YOUR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS FROM THEFT",
      "While it may seem counterintuitive, a VPN can offer faster connection speeds for online gaming. It can also help prevent your ISP from throttling bandwidth directly from gaming servers. By changing your VPN's location, you can connect to a server closer to your gaming server, which will give you better latency. This is also called ping, which determines how fast the server responds to your inputs.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "Tips for maximizing your VPN security",
      "To fully leverage the benefits of your VPN and enhance your online security, consider these important tips that will help protect your personal information and ensure safe browsing.",

      "2. Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on\u00a0public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5. Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up-to-date with the latest security patches.",
      "7. Be cautious of phishing scams while using a VPN:\u00a0Even with a VPN securing your connection, phishing scams remain a significant threat to your online safety. These scams often use deceptive emails or links to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. To protect yourself, combine the use of a VPN with\u00a0strong antivirus software that detects and blocks phishing attempts. Additionally, always scrutinize unsolicited emails, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and never provide personal information without verifying the source.\u00a0For the best protection, check out my expert reviews of the top 2024 antivirus solutions for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Together with a VPN, this approach helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you want to start taking your online privacy seriously, it's worth getting a VPN. There are a wide range of options available. You can pick up a router with a VPN or install a software VPN on your devices. I prefer to have a VPN on my laptop and smartphone, and I especially find it useful when traveling internationally.",

This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",

This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

      "Scammers have become skilled at creating convincing fake websites.",
      "Online financial scams have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting unsuspecting individuals through various deceptive techniques. Cybercriminals exploit trust and create convincing scenarios to steal personal and financial information, often using well-known platforms like PayPal as their hunting ground.",

      "\"I wanted to sign up for PayPal and used Google to get the website.

      "Key takeaways from Paul's experience",
      "Paul's unfortunate encounter with online fraud offers several important lessons. First, scammers have become adept at creating highly convincing fake websites that can easily fool unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate platforms down to the smallest details, making it crucial to verify the authenticity of any site requesting personal information.",
      "Second, fraudulent transactions can occur with alarming speed once scammers obtain sensitive data. In Paul's case, the thieves attempted to make purchases within minutes of acquiring his credit card information.",

      "Protecting your financial information online is crucial. Here are some important steps you can take to safeguard yourself against cyber threats:",
      "Verify the website's authenticity: Before entering any personal information online, always double-check the URL of the website you're visiting. Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the address and a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates a secure connection. To ensure you're on the correct site, type the web address directly into your browser instead of relying on search engine results or clicking on links from emails.",
      "Be wary of unsolicited communications:\u00a0Legitimate companies will never send unsolicited emails asking for sensitive information. Avoid clicking on links in emails claiming to be from financial institutions, as these could be phishing attempts. Hover over the links to see the actual URL before clicking, as this can help you identify suspicious or misleading addresses. If you're unsure about a communication, log in to your account directly through the official website or app to check for any notifications or requests.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Use strong authentication methods:\u00a0Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your financial accounts to add an extra layer of security. Create unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding the temptation to reuse passwords across multiple sites. Consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely.",
      "Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Make it a habit to check your financial accounts frequently for any unauthorized activities or suspicious transactions. Set up alerts for transactions on your credit cards and online payment accounts so you can be immediately notified of any activity on your accounts.",
      "Be cautious with personal information: Never share your passwords or answers to security questions with anyone, no matter how trustworthy they may seem. Be skeptical of any requests for personal information, especially those that create a sense of urgency. Legitimate organizations will not pressure you to provide sensitive data immediately.",
      "Use secure payment methods: When making purchases from unknown sellers, use protected payment options that offer buyer protection. Consider using credit cards for online purchases, as they often provide better fraud protection than debit cards. If a website offers multiple payment options, choose the most secure method available.",
      "Use caution with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks for financial transactions, as these can be easily compromised. If you must access financial accounts while away from home, use a secure VPN connection to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\u00a0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog.

      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down.

      "1. Use reliable security software:\u00a0Keeping your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from fake CAPTCHA scams. A strong antivirus software will detect and block malware like the Lumma info-stealer before it can infect your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable browser protection features:\u00a0Modern browsers offer built-in security features, such as Safe Browsing and phishing protection, which warn you about potentially dangerous sites. Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true. Fake CAPTCHA scams often disguise themselves as legitimate ads, asking you to click to verify you're human. Never interact with pop-up ads or unfamiliar banners, especially those that claim to give you something for free, as they may lead to malicious pages or trigger malware downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no question that fake CAPTCHA scams are a growing threat, putting millions of us at risk of malware infections and financial loss. What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem. The companies involved must take immediate action to improve content moderation, tighten security measures and prevent these scams from thriving. We are seeing a dangerous loophole in the digital advertising ecosystem that could have serious consequences for internet users.",

      "Data breaches happen all the time, and while no data breach should be ignored, those involving health care institutions require special attention.",
      "These breaches can be very damaging and haunt people for life. Recently, hackers leaked the personal data of around 500,000 Americans.",

      "CVR, a clinic headquartered in Maryland, experienced a massive data breach where hackers stole highly sensitive personal information, including lab results and health insurance details, as reported by\u00a0Cybernews. The breach occurred in early October, with the clinic detecting \"unusual activity\" in its systems on Oct. 6.",
      "CVR has more than 110 branches across the country, from Alabama to Alaska. This breach has affected hundreds of thousands of individuals. According to a\u00a0notice filed by CVR with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, more than 445,000 people had their personal information compromised.",
      "As the name suggests, CVR specializes in vein restoration, a very specialized procedure aimed at improving the health and function of veins. This means the clinic keeps a very elaborate record of its patients\u2019 health, and now all that is in the hands of hackers, along with copious amounts of personal information.",
      "The full list of exposed data includes addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical record numbers, diagnoses, lab results, medications, treatment information, health insurance information, provider names, dates of treatment and financial information.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The risks associated with the CVR data breach",
      "The risks of data breaches depend on the type of company affected. For instance, breaches involving companies like Ticketmaster are generally more manageable because they often expose information like contact details, addresses and, in some cases, identification documents. Even if financial data is leaked, it can typically be mitigated by replacing or blocking compromised accounts.",
      "Health care data breaches, however, are far more severe. When companies like CVR are targeted, hackers gain access to sensitive medical records that cannot be altered. Your medical history is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals can use this information to commit identity fraud, such as obtaining prescription drugs through false insurance claims. Plus, detailed knowledge of medical treatments, lab results and medications allows attackers to create highly targeted phishing scams, exploiting victims\u2019 vulnerabilities with alarming precision.",

      "2. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6. Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7. Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it's crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The CVR data breach is deeply troubling, affecting nearly half a million individuals and exposing highly sensitive medical and personal information. What makes this breach particularly concerning is the lasting impact health care data leaks can have on victims, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams.

      "Law enforcement officers don't always wait to find a body before bringing a murder charge, though, like in the cases of missing Texas realtor Suzanne Simpson and missing Massachusetts real estate executive Ana Walshe. Fox News contributor and former Washington, D.C., homicide detective Ted Williams explained why investigators sometimes pursue charges before a body is found.",
      "As authorities continue to search for Simpson, a 51-year-old mom of four who disappeared more than two months ago, her husband, Brad Simpson, remains behind bars, accused of killing his wife of 22 years.

      "Within a week of the discoveries, authorities arrested and charged Scott Peterson with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of his wife and unborn son.",

      "\"Around the world, when there is a crisis of some kind,\" Neuer said that \"you get a whole cluster of U.N. agencies,\" including the World Health Organization, World Food Programme, UNICEF \u2026 and UNDP, which combine forces to \"distribute aid to millions of people.\" Neuer said that \"the notion that is put forward that for some reason a tiny strip of land on the Gaza Strip is the only place in the world where those agencies cannot operate\" is \"absurd and false.\"",

      "UN Watch has raised the ire of UNRWA by beginning to release a 150-page dossier showing URNWA leaders meeting with representatives of terror groups. Though UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini referred to the reports as \"disinformation,\" Neuer explained that UNRWA simply \"cannot handle the truth.\" Neuer said that UN Watch assembled its dossier by screenshotting data and photographs that were \"hidden in plain sight\" on the internet and social media.\" He added that more of UN Watch\u2019s dossier is set to emerge the coming week.",
      "The U.S. was among nine nations to dissent from the General Assembly\u2019s resolution in support of UNRWA.",
      "Ambassador Robert Wood, the alternative representative for special political affairs, explained the dissension on Dec. 11, both noting that while URNWA is a \"critical lifeline,\" the \"resolution on UNRWA operations also has serious flaws.\" Wood cited how the proposal fails \"to create a path forward for restoring trust between Israel and UNRWA,\" and that the resolution \"denigrates Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza without addressing the central reason for them, namely Hamas\u2019 unprovoked October 7 attack and the terrorist group\u2019s deplorable behavior in the interim.\"",
      "Photos released by the Israeli Defense Force show three individuals the Israeli military claims are Hamas combatants inside the UNRWA compound in Rafah. (IDF)",
      "\"More than 14 months into this conflict, some delegations here in New York cannot bring themselves to acknowledge \u2014 let alone condemn \u2014 Hamas\u2019 role in instigating a conflict that has visited so much pain, suffering, and anguish on the people of Gaza,\" Wood wrote, adding that \"we deeply regret that the drafters chose to try to score political points, rather than pursue a resolution which could have provided unanimous support to UNRWA, addressed credible allegations about the activities of some of its personnel, and ultimately bolsters UNRWA\u2019s vital humanitarian mission.\"",

      "The General Assembly also emphasized that it \"strongly warns against any attempts to dismantle or diminish the operations and mandate of the Agency,\" noting the humanitarian consequences that millions of Palestinians would face if its work were interrupted or suspended.",
      "In an effort to assert the primacy of his organization despite snowballing evidence that its members have hindered efforts to create peace in the region, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini penned an op-ed imagining the possibly \"dystopian\" outcome of a decision to dismantle UNRWA. Supposing that a two-state solution hinges on the agency's continued operations, Lazzarini urged that \"we still have a\u00a0window of opportunity to avert a cataclysmic future where firepower and propaganda construct the global order.\"",
      "U.N. Watch's Neuer disagreed, noting \"UNRWA is an arsonist masquerading as a firefighter,\" he said. \"Only by ending this terror-infested agency with the pathological aim of perpetuating hatred, resentment and dependency, can Palestinians move forward to a future of hope and peace.\"",

    "summary": "A new report presented by the National Council of Resistance of Iran claims Tehran has expanded attempts to secretly develop weaponization capabilities for its nuclear program.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Trump responds to a question about whether he is considering a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "The Islamic Republic of Iran has continued its pursuit of obtaining a nuclear weapon by not only stockpiling enriched uranium to near-weapons grade purity, it has expanded its covert actions in developing its weaponization capabilities.",
      "According to information obtained by sources embedded in the Iranian regime and supplied to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition organization based out of D.C. and Paris, there are indications that Tehran has once again renewed efforts to advance its ability to detonate a nuclear weapon.",
      "At the head of Iran\u2019s detonators program is an organization the NCRI has dubbed METFAZ, which is the Farsi acronym for the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies on Explosions and Impact, and its recent movements at a previously deactivated site, known as Sanjarian, has drawn immense speculation.",
      "The Foundation for Defense of Democracies has analyzed where Iran's nuclear infrastructure is located. (Foundation for Defense of Democracies)",
      "IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS",
      "\"Our information shows the METFAZ has expanded its activities, intensified activities, and their main focus is basically the detonation of the nuclear bomb,\" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI in the U.S., told Fox News Digital. \"When you make a bomb, you have the fissile material at the center of it, but you need to be able to trigger it, to detonate it, and that\u2019s a sophisticated process.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to see what METFAZ does and follow their activities because that is sort of like a gauge on figuring out where the whole nuclear weapons program is,\" he added.",
      "Iran has at least a dozen sites across the country dedicated to nuclear development, weaponization, research and heavy water production, but information shared with Fox News Digital suggests that there has been an increase in covert activity in at least two of these locations, including Sanjarian, which was once one of Iran\u2019s top weaponization facilities.",
      "The Sanjarian site, located roughly 25 miles east of Tehran and once central to Iran\u2019s nuclear program under what is known as the Amad Plan, was believed to have been largely inactive between 2009 and late 2020 after stiff international pushback on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "The Sanjarian site in 2017, when the NCRI announced that its activities had moved to Plan 6 in Parchin. (Image provided by the NCRI)",
      "Though by October 2020 renewed activity had returned to the area under the alleged guise of a filming team, first captured through satellite imagery and which the Islamic Republic used to justify why\u00a0vehicles had reportedly been regularly parked outside the formerly top nuclear site.",
      "In 2022, trees were planted along the entrance road to the compound, effectively blocking satellite imagery from monitoring vehicles stationed there, before a security gate was then believed to have been installed in May 2023, according to information also verified by the Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "Sanjarian in 2024 (Image provided by the NCRI)",
      "Now, according to details supplied by on-the-ground sources to the NCRI this month, top nuclear experts have been seen regularly visiting the site since April 2024 and are believed to be operating under the front company known as Arvin Kimia Abzaar, which claims to be affiliated with the oil and gas industry, a sector in which Iran has long attempted to conceal its activities.",
      "ISRAEL EYES IRAN NUKE SITES AMID REPORTS TRUMP MULLS MOVES TO BLOCK TEHRAN ATOMIC PROGRAM",
      "Jafarzadeh said one of the executives of the Arvin Kimia Abzaar company is Saeed Borji, who has been a well-known member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps since 1980 and has long headed METFAZ.",
      "METFAZ falls under Iran\u2019s Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is widely known to security experts as the organization spearheading Iran\u2019s nuclear development and is suspected of using the Sanjarian site for renewed research on exoloding bridgewire (EWB) detonators.",
      "Iran has previously attempted to conceal its EBW detonators program, a system first invented in the 1940s to deploy atomic warheads but which has expanded into non-military sectors, under activities relating to the oil industry.",
      "In a 2015 report, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), noted that Iran\u2019s detonator development was an \"integral part of a program to develop an implosion-type nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "It also highlighted how Iran attempted to conceal its program by alleging during a May 20, 2014, meeting that the detonator program dating back to 2000-2003 was related to Tehran\u2019s aerospace industry and was needed to \"help prevent explosive accidents\" but which the IAEA determined was \"inconsistent with the timeframe and unrelated to the detonator development program.\"",
      "Technicians work at the Arak heavy water reactor's secondary circuit as officials and media visit the site in December 2019. (Atomic Energy Organization of Iran/AP)",

      "The IAEA assessed that while the application of EBW detonators, which are fired within \"sub-microsecond simultaneity,\" are \"not inconsistent with specialized industry practices,\" the detonators that Iran has developed \"have characteristics relevant to a nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "\"The Iranian regime has really basically, over the years, used deceptive tactics \u2013 lies, stalling, playing games, dragging [their feet], wasting time,\" Jafarzadeh said when asked about this report. \"That\u2019s the way they\u2019re dealing with the IAEA, with the goal of moving their own nuclear weapons program forward without being accountable for anything.\"",
      "The IAEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on the NCRI\u2019s most recent findings, which were shared with the nuclear watchdog this week, and it remains unclear what advancements or research Iran continues to pursue in the detonator field.",

      "\"While the international community and the IAEA have mainly focused on the amount and the enrichment level of uranium Tehran possesses, which would provide fissile material for the bomb, the central part, namely the weaponization, has continued with little scrutiny,\" Jafarzadeh told Fox News Digital.",
      "The NCRI also found that METFAZ, which operates out of a military site known as Parchin some 30 miles southeast of Tehran, has expanded its Plan 6 complex where it conducts explosive tests and production.",
      "Parchin, which is made up of several military industrial complexes, was targeted in Israel\u2019s October 2024 strikes. According to the Institute for Science and International Security, the strikes destroyed \"multiple buildings\" within the complex, including a \"high explosive test chamber\" known as Taleghan 2.",

      "Iran\u2019s layered approach to its nuclear program, which relies on networks operating under the guise of privately owned companies, false operations and immense ambiguity, has made tracking Tehran\u2019s nuclear program difficult for even agencies dedicated to nuclear security, like the IAEA, Jafarzadeh said.",
      "\"The regime has used deceptive tactics to prevent any mechanism for verification, and it has yet to provide an opportunity or the means for the IAEA to have a satisfactory answer to the inquiries it has raised,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Our revelation today shows that the regime has no transparency related to its program for building an atomic bomb and is moving towards building the bomb at a rapid pace.\"",
      "The NCRI confirms that neither the Sanjarian site nor Parchin\u2019s Plan 6 have ever been inspected by the IAEA.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 21:14:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Del Bigtree's Informed Consent Action Network, which advocates against polio, measles, hepatitis and Covid vaccines, brought in $23 million last year, tax records show.",
    "story": [
      "Del Bigtree, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement, brought in a record windfall last year for the nonprofit group he founded, according to the latest tax filings.",
      "The Informed Consent Action Network, known as ICAN, reported $23 million in revenue for 2023, a 74% increase from the previous year. The group spent nearly $17 million on efforts including legal battles and anti-vaccine advocacy, an increase of about 25% from the year before.",
      "The tax documents, obtained by NBC News from ICAN, show the increasing prominence and profitability of the anti-vaccine movement in the ongoing fight over vaccine policies and public health. The pandemic supercharged groups like ICAN, which reported about $3.5 million in revenue in 2019, expanding the audience interested in anti-vaccine content and growing the coffers of those who produce it. Numerous studies have found that vaccines are safe and save lives, and are not linked to autism, but that hasn\u2019t stopped misinformation from spreading.",
      "Revenue for Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had been on the rise as well until last year, when it dropped more than 30%, to $16 million. This loss coincided with Kennedy taking a leave from his positions as chairman and chief litigation counsel to launch an unsuccessful presidential bid.",
      "But ICAN\u2019s revenue continued to grow, and Bigtree\u2019s profile has risen. The former television producer and anti-vaccine filmmaker, whose organization was known for attention-grabbing stunts and filing freedom of information requests, became communications director for Kennedy\u2019s third-party presidential campaign and advised Kennedy as he prepared for his potential role as secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "Bigtree and ICAN did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Katie Miller, a spokesperson for Kennedy\u2019s transition team who was recently named to join the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, said Bigtree was never involved in the transition, and his views \u201cdo not represent Mr. Kennedy\u2019s or President Trump\u2019s administration.\u201d",
      "ICAN is not required to disclose individual donors, though tax documents filed last year show large donations from family foundations and donor-advised funds, philanthropic intermediaries that combine and anonymize donations.",
      "The group has celebrated what it characterizes as several big wins last year, including litigation that forced Mississippi to grant religious exemptions from vaccines. The group says it plans to pursue a similar strategy targeting the five other states that don\u2019t allow religious exemptions.",
      "ICAN relies on individual supporters to fund production of anti-vaccine content, including \u201cThe HighWire,\u201d a weekly anti-vaccine and conspiracy-laden internet show hosted by Bigtree that the group describes as its educational arm. Bigtree punctuates the show not with commercials but with impassioned pleas for donations, recently with multimillion-dollar fundraising goals associated with specific legal fights.",
      "ICAN\u2019s largest expenditure last year, $6 million, was to the New York law firm Siri & Glimstad, which pursues public records requests, intervenes in state anti-vaccine fights and petitions the federal government to pause or revoke vaccines, including one for polio. Led by Aaron Siri, an attorney and Kennedy adviser, the firm, aided by dozens of attorneys working on vaccine cases, has been paid some $20 million by ICAN since 2017, according to tax documents.",
      "Siri defended his work in an email to NBC News, saying his petitions sought increased safety for vaccines and that ICAN\u2019s financial support was \u201ctrivial\u201d compared to spending by the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Miller said Siri was no longer involved in the transition and that he does not represent Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "ICAN describes its legal efforts as \u201cadvocating for humanity\u2019s right to informed consent.\u201d Experts have described it as an exploitation of the courts. \u201cAgain and again, this anti-vaccine group misrepresented both the legal and the factual meanings of court decisions, settlements, and other legal actions to create a narrative to galvanize its followers and influence newcomers,\u201d a 2022 article in the Northwestern Journal of Law and Social Policy read. (Siri called the article \u201creplete with categorically false claims.\u201d)",
      "The intent of other spending was less clear. ICAN paid $176,000 for \u201cresearch consulting\u201d to a U.K. company headed by a chiropractor who has lectured on what he claims are dangers from vaccines and 5G technology. The group also paid $152,000 for consulting to Uncover DC, a news website founded and edited by Tracy Diaz, known online as Tracy Beanz, a popular conspiracy theorist and early promoter in the QAnon movement. Diaz, who describes her site as \u201cactual journalism,\u201d posts news releases for ICAN and writes for the nonprofit\u2019s website as a contributor.",
      "Bigtree took home a $234,000 salary from ICAN in 2023, in addition to his income from paid speaking engagements (he says he only charges for ticketed events). Bigtree also earned $350,000 for consulting and communications work on Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign over the past two years through KFP Consulting, a Texas organization registered to Bigtree.",
      "Bigtree now helms a super PAC (MAHA Alliance) and a nonprofit organization (MAHA Action), both short for Make America Healthy Again, a spin on Trump\u2019s MAGA motto adopted by Kennedy after he dropped out of the race and endorsed the ultimately winning candidate.",
      "Bigtree acknowledged his multiple streams of income and endeavors on \u201cThe HighWire\u201d in November. \u201cI feel incredibly blessed by God that I had all these opportunities converging all at once,\u201d he said."

      "As of Dec. 14, 32,000 cases had been recorded, compared with more than 5,100 cases at the same time last year.",
      "Experts attribute the trend to a combination of factors, including a decrease in the vaccination rate.",
      "Whooping cough cases in the U.S. have reached the highest annual total in a decade, with as many cases tallied in the last 12 weeks as in the entire rest of the year.",
      "As of mid-September, about 14,500 cases had been recorded nationwide since the beginning of the year. That number climbed to more than 32,000 as of Dec. 14, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "That's a six-fold increase from the same time in 2023, when more than 5,100 cases had been recorded. The total for 2022 was even lower, at roughly 3,000 cases.",
      "Experts attribute the high case tally to a combination of factors. For one, whooping cough cases dropped to levels far lower than average during the Covid pandemic, so a jump back to pre-pandemic patterns was expected. However, this year\u2019s total is significantly higher than 2019\u2019s, likely due to waning vaccine protection, lower vaccination rates and improved testing, they said.",
      "Also known as pertussis, whooping cough is a bacterial infection that affects the upper respiratory system. Its spread typically follows a seasonal pattern, with a peak in the fall or winter.",
      "Early symptoms can resemble a common cold \u2014 cough, fever and a runny nose \u2014 but after a week or two, patients often develop aggressive cough attacks during which it's difficult to breathe. The term whooping cough is a reference to the high-pitched \u201cwhoop\u201d sound that some infected people make as they inhale after a coughing fit.",
      "\"They don\u2019t have time in between those coughs to take a breath,\" said Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of California, Davis, Children\u2019s Hospital. \"Sometimes, if it\u2019s so severe, the kids end up being intubated or on a ventilator so that they can get oxygen.\"",
      "Infants are the most vulnerable to whooping cough, with the highest risk of getting infected and of serious complications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s most severe in the youngest kids, so certainly those less than a year, and especially those less than 6 months of age,\u201d Blumberg said. \u201cI personally have seen a patient who\u2019s died from pertussis this year, and I\u2019ve seen several that have been in the ICU.\u201d",
      "He added that most of the whooping cough patients he's seen have been unvaccinated and that he\u2019s noticed a decline in vaccine coverage.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more vaccine hesitancy and, unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen more kids who are unimmunized getting pertussis,\u201d Blumberg said.",
      "The CDC recommends whooping cough vaccines, which help protect against\u00a0pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, for everyone in the U.S., starting at 2 months old. Infants should get doses of the DTaP shot, as it's known, at 2, 4 and 6 months, followed by booster shots when they are between 12 and 15 months old and again at 4 to 6 years old.",
      "One dose of a different formulation of the shot, the Tdap vaccine, is also recommended for preteens between 11 and 12 and for adults every 10 years.",
      "Whooping cough vaccination rates in the U.S. remain high, but they have declined over the last five years or so. Whereas more than 94% of children born between 2018 and 2019 had received at least three doses of the DTap vaccine by their second birthdays, the rate fell to around 92.5% for those born between 2020 and 2021, according to a CDC report published in September.",
      "Among kindergarteners, the share who had gotten state-required vaccinations \u2014 including DTap \u2014 fell from 95% in the 2019\u201320 school year to below 93% for the 2023\u201324 school year, the CDC found in October.",
      "Of children under 1 who were hospitalized with whooping cough last year, only around 29% had gotten at least three vaccine doses, according to the CDC.",
      "The vaccine's protection fades over time.",
      "Santina Wheat, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, said most of the whooping cough patients she\u2019s seen have been vaccinated tweens and adults.",
      "\"I think we\u2019re probably seeing some of the impacts of the waning immunity,\" she said.",
      "Wheat added that an improved ability to diagnose whooping cough is probably also contributing to the United States' higher case total.",
      "\"We now have better testing options, so I'm able to run a panel that looks for a variety of different things, and pertussis is one of those,\" she said. \"Numbers are up, but I also think some of it is just us recognizing it more frequently.\"",
      "Nonetheless, Blumberg urged parents to take whooping cough's threat seriously and get children vaccinated or boosted.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Pertussis is just a cough and kids get over it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe need clear and consistent messaging about vaccines. Many people have forgotten about them.\u201d"

      "The toy industry is headed for its second consecutive annual sales decline, but it\u2019s got one thing propping it up: colorful, interlocking plastic bricks.",
      "At a time when toy companies are struggling to match the massive gains of pandemic-era sales, Lego is growing rapidly. The Danish company saw\u00a0revenue jump 13% in the first six months of the year\u00a0and continues to snap up market share.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at toy sales, Lego has just been driving all the growth in the industry this year,\u201d said Eric Handler, managing director at Roth MKM.",
      "After coming to\u00a0the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s, Lego has reshaped its business and diversified its customer base, helping it to elevate sales even in inflationary market conditions.",
      "Lego has posted positive annual revenue growth in each of the past six years.",
      "Its strategy has involved delving into the world of licensing, catering to adults as well as kids, tapping into the digital gaming world, partnering with studios and streamers to bring Lego content to consumers and building manufacturing sites close to distribution hubs to smooth the supply chain.",
      "Recent standouts among its tried-and-true portfolio are newly emphasized \u201cpassion points,\u201d kits that appeal to a wide variety of consumers, from those obsessed with franchises such as Star Wars and Harry Potter to car enthusiasts and animal lovers.",
      "\u201cLego has consistently bucked the trend the past few years,\u201d said James Zahn,\u00a0editor in chief of The Toy Book. \u201cWhen other companies go down, Lego tends to go up.\u201d",
      "Zahn noted that Lego\u2019s ability to be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d has allowed it to be more nimble during times of inflation, as consumers tighten their purse strings, and to navigate upheaval in the theatrical entertainment industry and even looming tariff increases.",
      "\u201cI think, perhaps, the overarching story here is that they really are, it seems, like they\u2019re two to three steps ahead of everybody else,\u201d Zahn said.",
      "License for fun",
      "From miniature models of Emerald City from \u201cWicked\u201d to a version of Wednesday and Enid\u2019s dorm room in the Jenna Ortega-led \u201cWednesday,\u201d Lego has tapped into pop culture to bring fan-favorite stories to life in brick form.",
      "Licensing has long been an important strategy for toy companies. Pulling from existing and upcoming intellectual property from movies and television shows allows brands such as Lego to cater to an already robust and engaged consumer.",
      "Lego\u2019s first licensed partnership was in 1999 when it linked up with Lucasfilm to bring Star Wars sets to the public. Some of these kits were tied to the release of \u201cStar Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace,\u201d while others celebrated vehicles and characters from the original trilogy of films.",
      "\u201cLego embraced adults, long\u00a0before we started saying \u2018kidults,\u2019\u00a0and they\u2019ve managed to continue that in new ways,\u201d said Zahn.",
      "Over the past two decades, Lego has worked with hundreds of other partners to translate the likes of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters, Marvel, DC, Jurassic Park and Pixar into building blocks.",
      "More recently, the company has launched kits such as the Sanderson sisters\u2019 house from \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d and even a \u201cJaws\u201d set featuring the iconic shark taking down Quint\u2019s boat.",
      "\u201cFor the Lego brand, [we\u2019ve seen] tremendous years of growth,\u201d said Julia Goldin, chief product and marketing officer at Lego. \u201cWe made a very deliberate decision to unlock our potential with many new audiences, double down on the audiences that we already had and really ensure that we are very connected.\u201d",
      "Finding new brick builders",
      "Lego isn\u2019t stopping at franchise-based sets.",
      "The company has worked to design different types of sets that cater to new audiences, ones that might not have otherwise bought or built a Lego set, Zahn said. This includes cityscape sets featuring skylines from London to New York, brick versions of famous paintings such as Vincent van Gogh\u2019s \u201cStarry Night\u201d and Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d as well as a line of botanicals.",
      "Goldin noted that Lego is \u201cinvesting in bringing in new audiences to the portfolio\u201d and creating more products for them.",
      "That\u2019s why Lego has partnered with Formula 1 to create a line of F1-inspired sets that range from Duplo kits for preschool children all the way to collectible sets for adults. The partnership will also span Lego\u2019s digital platforms, and the toy company will have a presence at future F1 auto racing events.",
      "Goldin said previous car products, including a McLaren Lego set, performed well at retail, giving Lego confidence to delve deeper into the auto racing space.",
      "\u201cWe always start with the audience,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at, what are kids into? And we saw that F1 was one of the No. 1 most growing passions among younger kids, and also growing globally and attracting a lot of new audiences, especially women and families.\u201d",
      "Attracting new consumers has allowed Lego to drive revenue and helped to counterbalance softness in the theatrical realm.",
      "Much of the toy industry\u2019s current sales woes can be attributed to the disrupted pipeline in Hollywood production. A global pandemic followed by labor strikes left Tinsel town with fewer new releases that could have served as the basis for breakout toys.",
      "The lack of kids movies, in particular, meant toy companies were not producing as many new action figures, roleplay items and other movie tie-ins.",
      "But in 2023, Lego offered 780 products, around 50% of which were new items, on par with recent years.",
      "Delving into digital",
      "At the same time, Lego has expanded beyond its retail shelf space.",
      "The company has launched several theatrical features of its own, partnered with streamers such as Disney+ to bring Marvel and Star Wars content to the small screen and even launched its own vertical within Epic Games\u2019 popular Fortnite game.",
      "The expanding portfolio has kept Lego at the forefront of consumers\u2019 minds, given them alternative ways to engage with the brand and driven incremental retail purchases.",
      "\u201cWe have to remember that kids, they grow up,\u201d said Goldin. \u201cSo there\u2019s a new generation coming all the time. I think the next five years we\u2019ll see even more digitalization and interactivity coming into the different experiences that we can create.\u201d",
      "Goldin said with Fortnite, the company aimed to go beyond sets and create an experience. Within the larger game of Fortnite, players can participate in a Lego-based world where they construct digital Lego buildings, battle against creatures, customize their online mini figure and socialize with other Lego fans.",
      "Lego CEO Niels Christiansen has\u00a0repeatedly touted\u00a0the importance of meeting kids where they are, noting during previous earnings reports that the company is competing for children\u2019s time and attention. Being relevant to them and in spaces that they already occupy has translated back to sales of physical Lego kits.",
      "It is a similar strategy to the one Lego has employed in partnering with Disney+ for several Star Wars and Marvel animated shows and in its recent theatrical release of a feature-length animated documentary about Pharrell Williams called \u201cPiece by Piece.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The first city in the U.S. to approve reparations has given 200 people in cash or assistance. We asked three residents how that money has affected their lives.",
    "story": [
      "EVANSTON, Ill. \u2014 Kenneth Wideman has lived in Evanston his entire life, in a neighborhood bordered by a canal and elevated railroad tracks called the 5th Ward.",
      "His parents moved there from South Carolina, part of an exodus of 6 million Black people fleeing the Jim Crow South over a 60-year period known as the Great Migration. By the time Wideman was born in the 1940s, Evanston was the state\u2019s largest Black suburb, and 95% of the city\u2019s Black population lived in the 5th Ward.",
      "The concentration of Black residents in that neighborhood, however, was no accident.",
      "The city began pushing Black residents out of neighborhoods outside the 5th Ward through targeted zoning in 1919. Later, federal agencies facilitated racially restrictive housing rules and banking discrimination, discouraging lenders from making \u201crisky\u201d loans in predominantly Black neighborhoods such as the 5th Ward.",
      "In 1969, after the federal Fair Housing Act prohibited housing discrimination based on race, Evanston city officials passed local fair housing ordinances. But decades later, the 5th Ward had the lowest property values in the city, median income below the city\u2019s average, and is Evanston\u2019s \u201conly neighborhood with areas classified as food deserts,\u201d according to a 2019 report by the city clerk.",
      "That year, the city set out to create the country\u2019s first reparations program to atone for its history of racial discrimination. Since the program began in 2022, Evanston has awarded $25,000 checks and in-kind financial assistance to more than 200 people.",
      "In May, a conservative legal group sued the city, arguing that the program is unconstitutional, violating the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against applicants based on race.Although reparations payments are still being dispensed, the lawsuit aims to stop the program in its entirety by preventing the city from using race to determine eligibility.",
      "A ruling from a federal judge is forthcoming.",
      "Wideman was part of the first cohort of recipients, selected by age. To be eligible, a person has to be Black and prove they lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2014 the period when state-sponsored segregation and redlining were rampant \u2014 or be a direct descendant of someone who did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate and blessed to receive the reparations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it could have been more. But I\u2019m happy.\u201d",
      "Wideman is one of three Evanston residents who sat down with NBC News to discuss their experience of growing up in the 5th Ward, applying for and receiving reparations.",
      "Ambulances wail down a busy thruway en route to a hospital near Kenneth Wideman\u2019s apartment, where he lives alone.",
      "He is usually coming from or\u00a0going to doctor\u2019s appointments because he has chronic health issues. In 2024, Wideman can go to any hospital in the city, but in 1945, his mother had to go to a segregated hospital to give birth to him.",
      "A husband and wife team of Black doctors, Arthur Butler and Isabella Garnett, ran the hospital out of a converted residential home because the city\u2019s two main hospitals, the Evanston Hospital and St. Francis Hospital, did not take Black patients at the time.",
      "He and his family attended segregated schools, beaches, restaurants, stores, playgrounds and theaters. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what segregation was,\u201d Wideman said. \u201cNow that I know about it, I\u2019m figuring out this was segregated, that was segregated.\u201d",
      "Wideman\u2019s family, like many other Black families at the time, lived in a multigenerational home in the 5th Ward with 14 people. He shared a room with four people, but Wideman said growing up with his grandmother was the best thing that ever happened to him. He recalls sleeping with his head on his grandmother\u2019s stomach. \u201cNothing else compared,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have done a lot of things in my life.\u201d",
      "Wideman\u2019s current apartment is sandwiched between the campus of Northwestern University, where he worked as a facilities manager for three decades, and the community center where he applied for the city\u2019s reparations program after hearing about it through word of mouth.",
      "City employees laid out high school yearbooks and phone books so that applicants could prove they lived in Evanston during the specific period, and they helped seniors fill out the electronic application.",
      "\u201cI think people deserve reparations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI hope that other people will have the opportunity to receive reparations,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I hope they would get more than what I got.\u201d",
      "Despite its history, which Wideman knows well, he loves Evanston. \u201cWherever I go, they ask me where I\u2019m from. And I tell them I\u2019m from Evanston, Illinois,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great town.\u201d",
      "Ron Butler grew up in the 5th Ward, but in 1976 he and his wife, Cheryl, decided to move to south Evanston, to a modest two-story house in a residential neighborhood where they live now.",
      "The afternoon sunlight passes into the living room through bay windows and a stained-glass panel of roses he made by hand.",
      "It was unusual for a Black family to move to this part of town, he said, and even now they are one of just a few Black families on their street. \u201cAs soon as we moved into the house, all the \u2018for sale\u2019 signs started going up down the street.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of neighbors didn\u2019t want us,\u201d he said, especially the older neighbors. \u201cThey asked the people who sold the house to us, \u2018Why did you sell to a Black family?\u2019\u201d",
      "In the 5th Ward things were different. \u201cWe had no keys to unlock the doors, you know, and if you did something wrong, your neighbors always told your parents.\u201d",
      "He went to university in Nebraska, where he played football, and then he served a couple years in the Army, stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. When he moved back to Evanston, he took a job working at the public utility company.",
      "Butler was part of the second cohort of reparations recipients.",
      "The check came \u201cright on time,\u201d he said. His house needed the windows replaced and a new furnace with central air, so he and his wife both pooled their $25,000 checks. \u201cThe money goes fast,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt meant something to me, because, you know, it gave me a little help,\u201d he said deliberately. \u201cYou know, Evanston is a very expensive place to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always said that you can keep the mule, but give me the 40 acres,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me the 40 acres in Evanston.\u201d",
      "Cherylette Hilton moved to Evanston when she was a teenager from a little town in Georgia called Waynesboro. \u201cRight down the neck of the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d she said. Hilton loved horseback riding and taking care of the animals. \u201cI wanted to just stay there and enjoy that type of country lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Her parents moved the family to a house in the 5th Ward because it was predominantly Black. \u201cThey felt it would have been difficult to live in another neighborhood,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she did not let encountering racism and segregation in Evanston bother her. \u201cThat\u2019s them. I let them deal with that,\u201d she said.",
      "She is outgoing and chatty, and living with her extended family means she is often in the middle of multiple conversations at once as people walk in and out of the living room.",
      "She decided to apply to the reparations program when it began offering checks last year.",
      "At first, Evanston\u2019s reparations program offered recipients only in-kind financial assistance, which could be used toward mortgage payments, a down payment for a house, or home improvement projects.",
      "A real estate broker since she was 18, Hilton had been promoting the program to her clients, but because she lives in an apartment, she hadn\u2019t initially been eligible.",
      "Hilton used the money to buy a car and put the rest in the bank, she said, for her grandkids and great-grandkids. She is still a real estate broker but spends most of her time volunteering with children in juvenile detention or formerly incarcerated adults transitioning back into society, as well as taking care of her family.",
      "Evanston is now very expensive, she said, noting that $25,000 is \u201cjust a drop in the bucket\u201d \u2014 a common complaint among interview subjects.",
      "Former city Alderman Robin Rue Simmons orchestrated the city\u2019s reparations push in 2019. She grew up in the 5th Ward and \u201csaw firsthand the disparities between the livability of Black Evanstonians and that of white,\u201d she said, sitting in the lobby of a downtown hotel.\u00a0Securing the political will and passing the reparations proposal was in some sense the easy part. Then came the task of constructing the program from scratch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a model to follow,\u201d she said.",
      "The $20 million program, funded by the city\u2019s cannabis sales tax and real estate tax, is set to continue for another five years, with plans to expand to economic development and education-based initiatives.",
      "Since the end of the Civil War, calls for some form of reparations for slavery have continued unabated.",
      "Federal legislation called H.R. 40, which would create a commission to study reparations for slavery, has been reintroduced every year for the past 35 years.",
      "In the absence of federal legislation, state and municipal reparations programs have taken off. Currently, more than a dozen cities, three counties and four states have passed legislation and are either researching the need for reparations or developing proposals.",
      "Evanston is the first to set up a program and make actual reparations payments.",
      "\u201cWe have a long, long road ahead of us,\u201d said Simmons, who now leads a reparations consultancy organization. \u201cThere is still more to learn. There is far more to achieve.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 21:56:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Immigrant's rights advocates are helping vulnerable families prepare plans of action in case an undocumented relative is suddenly detained or deported.",
    "story": [
      "Immigrant families are spending the holidays having difficult conversations in anticipation of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plan to carry out what he has called \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history\u201d once he's sworn in next month.",
      "\u201cA lot of us are honestly celebrating Christmas together thinking, \u2018Oh my God, is this the last time we get to spend Christmas with our family members?\u2019\u201d said Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet, who leads the Hope CommUnity Center, a nonprofit organization outside of Orlando, Florida, that advocates for immigrants and other underserved communities. \"This is really heart-wrenching.\"",
      "To deliver on Trump's promise to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants, the incoming administration intends to roll back policies that restrict immigration enforcement\u00a0actions in sensitive places like schools, churches and hospitals, as well as their respective surrounding areas, NBC News reported.",
      "\"There\u2019s no way they can deport millions of people if they don\u2019t go for the low-hanging fruit, and this is it,\u201d Sousa-Lazaballet said.",
      "NBC News spoke with nearly a half-dozen immigrants' rights advocates across four states, and they all said they have received an increased number of calls from immigrants asking about their rights. They have also heard questions from community groups, schools and churches about what their roles are in the face of such possibilities.",
      "In response, the advocates and groups are conducting know-your-rights trainings and helping vulnerable families prepare plans of action in case an undocumented relative is suddenly detained or deported.",
      "In Texas, a new law requiring some hospitals to ask patients about their immigration status is starting to \"push folks further into the shadows,\" showing a glimpse into what happens when sensitive locations become targets of immigration enforcement, said Javier Hidalgo, legal director of RAICES, a nonprofit group in San Antonio that advocates for refugees and immigrants.",
      "Texas has become a model for immigration crackdown, Hidalgo said, but that has also motivated advocates and nonprofits to provide tools and resources to affected families to curb the detrimental effects of detentions and deportations. These stand to impact nearly 5.8 million U.S. households, in which at least one relative is undocumented.",
      "Like Texas, Florida will also \"see the brunt\" of Trump's immigration policies sooner than other states, since Gov. Ron DeSantis has shown himself to be an ally in advancing the incoming president\u2019s agenda, Sousa-Lazaballet said.",
      "Similar to what Hidalgo is doing in Texas, Sousa-Lazaballet in Florida has been facilitating thousands of difficult, but necessary, conversations to ensure immigrant families have a \"dignity plan\" in place.",
      "The plan includes redacting power-of-attorney documents or a guardianship that outlines who will take care of the children left behind if an undocumented parent is picked up by immigration authorities. Sousa-Lazaballet said this ensures parents don't lose custody of their children to the Department of Families and Children simply because they never made it home after being detained or deported.",
      "In Phoenix, Arizona, Jose Pati\u00f1o, vice president of education and external affairs at Aliento, an advocacy organization, is doing the same with its \"family packets.\" Pati\u00f1o said it's important for families to sort out legal guardianship over any of their properties and financial accounts to ensure the relatives left behind can access them if the main breadwinner is detained or deported.",
      "In Sousa-Lazaballet\u2019s experience, the first 30 to 45 minutes of these kinds of conversations are \u201cof just crying, sobbing, and us trying to get people back enough to their senses\u201d to craft the plan they need.",
      "While preparing for the worst is important, the process also takes an unmeasurable mental health toll on both adults and children in immigrant families as they attempt to continue living through their daily routines, Pati\u00f1o, Hidalgo and Sousa-Lazaballet said.",
      "RAICES, the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas and a leading refugee resettlement agency, has said it's \"ready to challenge any presidential actions that threaten equitable access to the legal and human right to seek safety in the U.S.\"",
      "If the policy restricting immigration enforcement actions on sensitive locations is rescinded, depending on how the Trump administration executes that, there may be legal ground for a challenge, Hidalgo said. Until then, the organization will remain vigilant.",
      "The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles plans to do the same, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, its director of communications.",
      "Over the past month, the coalition offered 93 know-your-rights presentations at L.A. schools, businesses and organizations that provide community services. As Inauguration Day approaches, Cabrera said he anticipates the demand for these kinds of trainings to increase.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"does not have jurisdiction over our lives, the Constitution does, and we are protected regardless of our immigration status,\" Cabrera said.",
      "On Jan. 20, United We Dream, the nation\u2019s largest immigrant youth-led network, plans to reopen the hotline they launched during Trump's first term as president, said Anabel Mendoza, the organization's interim director of communications.",
      "Mendoza said the hotline will provide support to immigrants and anyone affected by immigration enforcement actions in the coming year.",
      "\"No one will be immune to feeling the ramifications and consequences of mass deportations. It affects everybody,\" she said. That's why United We Dream is also urging elected officials at all government levels to \"stand with immigrants,\" but most importantly to take \"concrete and tangible actions that put up barriers to what we know Trump is planning.\"",
      "That, alongside \"massive public pressure,\" would be key to ensuring that immigration enforcement tactics that \"go against American values\" don't become the new normal, Pati\u00f1o said.",
      "In the meantime, Pati\u00f1o said he is advising undocumented immigrants, especially young ones, to get legal screenings to find out if they are eligible for any kind of relief that may put them on a path to get legal immigration status.",
      "For those who are already in that process, Hidalgo recommends they always have their immigration paperwork up to date and carry the documents with them in case of an encounter with an immigration enforcement officer."

      "President-elect Donald Trump shared his renewed interest Sunday in the U.S. controlling the autonomous territory of Greenland, which is owned by Denmark.",
      "\"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump wrote in a statement announcing that he had chosen Ken Howery to serve as ambassador to Denmark.",
      "Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, has already rejected Trump's remarks, saying in a statement: \u201cGreenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,\" according to Reuters.",
      "Trump floated purchasing Greenland during his first term as president on multiple occasions.",
      "He told reporters in 2019 about the island, \u201cStrategically it\u2019s interesting, and we\u2019d be interested, but we\u2019ll talk to them a little bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst we have to find out whether or not they have any interest,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "At that point, Denmark said that Greenland was not for sale, which caused Trump to cancel a trip he had scheduled to the country. He said in a tweet that Denmark is \"a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time.\u201d",
      "Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration, told MSNBC in 2020 that Trump had asked him and other officials in 2018 whether the\u00a0U.S. could swap Greenland for Puerto Rico\u00a0because, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201cPuerto Rico was dirty and the people were poor.\" He said the conversation occurred before DHS officials traveled to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, to help with the recovery from Hurricane Maria.",
      "Greenland, between the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean, is technically part of North America and is the largest island in the world. While a majority of Greenland is covered in ice, about 57,000 people live there.",
      "The U.S. has considered purchasing Greenland at least twice, including in 1867 and then in 1946, when President Harry S. Truman proposed buying it for $100 million. Denmark rejected the offer."

      "U.S. Judge Amy Berman Jackson returned the verdict on Monday finding Lamond guilty of four counts, including obstruction of justice and three counts of lying to investigators, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said. The verdict followed a bench trial which featured contentious testimony from Tarrio, who insisted that he'd been contemporaneously lying to his fellow Proud Boys about receiving information from a source in the Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "Prosecutors argued during the trial that Lamond had become a \"double agent\" for the Proud Boys, saying he had tipped off Tarrio that there was a warrant out for his arrest in connection with the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner during Tarrio's prior trip to Washington with the Proud Boys.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you I wanted to go to D.C. to get arrested; that sounds weird,\u201d Tarrio said on the stand, but explained he wanted to travel to Washington two days before Jan. 6 to \"get this over with\u201d and to set up a \u201ccircus tent\u201d to use his arrest as a \u201cmarketing ploy.\u201d",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to begin pardoning Jan. 6 defendants when he takes office in less than a month. It is unclear if Tarrio is among the more than 1,500 defendants charged and more than 1,100 defendants convicted who could receive a pardon, and sources in both the Jan. 6 and law enforcement communities told NBC News that it's clear Trump is not read in on the details of the cases.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the NCAA, accusing the college athletic association of misleading fans by allowing transgender athletes to participate in women\u2019s events.",
      "The lawsuit argues that permitting athletes who were assigned male at birth to play in women\u2019s sports confuses and tricks consumers who attend sporting events that the NCAA has advertised as being restricted to female athletes.",
      "\u201cTexas consumers are legally entitled to spend their hard-earned dollars on the competitions that matter to them, without being misled. This Court should enjoin the NCAA from its misleading and unlawful conduct to protect Texas consumers from the NCAA\u2019s false, deceptive, and misleading practices,\u201d reads the lawsuit, which was filed in state district court in Lubbock.",
      "In a news release Sunday announcing the suit, Paxton said he wanted the court to prohibit the NCAA from allowing biological males to compete in women\u2019s sports in Texas or to stop the NCAA from marketing events as \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d when transgender athletes are competing.",
      "\u201cThe NCAA is intentionally and knowingly jeopardizing the safety and wellbeing of women by deceptively changing women\u2019s competitions into co-ed competitions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people watch a women\u2019s volleyball game, for example, they expect to see women playing against other women \u2014 not biological males pretending to be something they are not. Radical \u2018gender theory\u2019 has no place in college sports.\u201d",
      "His statement appeared to refer to the San Jose State University women\u2019s volleyball team, which this year was boycotted by a handful of opponents who refused to compete because they said it had a transgender player. A federal court last month rejected a request to block the team member from playing in the Mountain West Conference tournament.",
      "The NCAA declined to comment Monday on the allegations in Paxton\u2019s legal complaint and reiterated its commitment to enforcing Title IX, the landmark federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities.",
      "\u201cCollege sports are the premier stage for women\u2019s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women\u2019s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,\u201d Communications Director Michelle Brutlag Hosick said in an email.",
      "The NCAA did not answer a question about how many of its athletes are transgender. NCAA President Charlie Baker said at a congressional hearing last week that he is aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes who currently compete out of more than 500,000 NCAA players.",
      "Transgender inclusion in women\u2019s sports has become an increasingly fraught topic. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants \u201ctransgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\u201d including keeping athletes assigned male at birth out of women\u2019s sports teams. Some Democrats have also been critical of transgender athletes\u2019 competing in women\u2019s events.",
      "Since 2010, NCAA policy has required trans athletes who were assigned male at birth to finish at least one year of testosterone-suppression treatment before they can be eligible to compete on women\u2019s teams.",
      "Paxton\u2019s lawsuit called it \u201cunfair and unsafe\u201d for trans athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.",
      "\u201cThe inherent unfairness of men competing against women in women\u2019s sports is a material fact impacting consumer\u2019s decisions about whether to purchase goods and services associated with women\u2019s sporting events,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 23, 2024, 6:35 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when NCAA President Charlie Baker spoke to a congressional committee. It was Dec. 18, not earlier this week."

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 19:00:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Netflix\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, is based on the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields. Here's what to know about the true story.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon MGM Studios' new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, tells the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields and how she overcame all odds to be one of the greatest female boxers alive.",
      "Though Shields accomplished much in her life, including becoming the \"first American boxer (male or female) ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games,\" her road to victory was anything but easy.",
      "She grew up in poverty in Flint, Michigan to a mother who battled alcoholism and a father who was in jail during the early years of her life. At age 11, Shields started boxing with the help of her coach Jason Crutchfield, played by Brian Tyree Henry in the film, and that helped her deal with a lot of anger she had while growing up.",
      "\"I was molested and raped. But I channeled all the anger from that into boxing, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so successful at it,\" she told ESPN of her childhood. \"Boxing really helped with that. It calmed me down a lot and gave me discipline and structure.\"",
      "Thanks to boxing, Shields found a way out of her tumultuous home life and was able to create a name for herself in the sports world.",
      "Scroll below to learn all about Shields and how close the film, \"The Fire Inside,\" is to her real life.",
      "Who is Claressa \u2018T-Rex\u2019 Shields?",
      "Claressa Shields, aka T-Rex, is an American professional boxer from Flint, Michigan. In 2012, Shields headed to the Olympics at 17 years old and became the first American woman to win gold in boxing. Then, four years later at the 2016 Olympics, she did it again when she secured her second gold medal.",
      "Now at age 29, Shields holds the title as being the first American boxer ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games.",
      "Not to mention, she's also a three-time undisputed champ. The only fight that Shields ever lost in her boxing career was against British World Champion Savannah Marshall just months before the 2012 Olympic Games, per the Olympics. However, she avenged herself in 2022 when the two went head-to-head in London for the middleweight champion title.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Shields explained how she got her nickname \"T-Rex.\" She said she got the moniker as a child when she was \"very skinny\" and had \"short arms.\"",
      "What happened to Claressa Shields after the Olympics?",
      "Shields' life did not change much after she brought home a gold medal in boxing at the 2012 Olympics. That was the same year that women\u2019s boxing became an official Olympic sport.",
      "The self-proclaimed GWOAT (Greatest Woman of All Time) returned home to Flint, Michigan, with no endorsement deals whatsoever.",
      "In the movie, it's said that Shields was still living on her coach's couch after she had just made history at the Olympics.",
      "In an interview with NPR, Shields said that the public wasn't comfortable with her image and she was advised to stop boasting about how she likes to beat people up in her interviews.",
      "\u201cThey had this weird definition of what a strong woman was. For some reason, that definition was pretty, non-sweaty and not as muscular. And one, I\u2019m very pretty. I think I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d said with a grin.",
      "\u201cBut the fact of it is,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen [I\u2019m] boxing, I look so strong and I\u2019m punching so hard and I\u2019m punching so fast, and [I] make people feel intimidated. I think that now people are starting to embrace that. The definition of a strong woman is\u00a0Laila Ali.\u00a0Lucia Rijker. Serena Williams. Claressa Shields.\u201d",
      "Shields told Entertainment Weekly that it was hard for her to see other people get brand deals who didn't win gold medals. She explained that it was also difficult to see brands flock to her friends like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky and then offer her nothing.",
      "\"I felt like my gold medal weighed less than theirs. So to be a 17-year-old going through that and also be in Flint where everybody\u2019s saying, 'They played you, they dissed you, your gold medal didn\u2019t mean anything, you\u2019re not getting what you deserve' \u2014 to hear that for so many years and then go back and do it again was like, 'Oh, man,'\" she said.",
      "How accurate is \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "\"The Fire Inside\" is loosely based on Shields' life so all events in the film are not exactly true. For instance, the movie portrays Shields as a fighter who wanted to win gold at the 2012 Olympics. However, in an interview with ESPN, she said she heavily contemplated whether or not she wanted to come in first.",
      "After she lost her fight against Marshall at the 2012 AIBA world championships in China, Shields said she noticed that the dynamic around her started to change from people believing in her to having doubts about her talents. She said they didn't change their tune until she made it all the way to the finals in the 2012 Olympics.",
      "\"I really hated the fake vibes. I felt it from my Olympic teammates, some of the coaches and from people at home also,\" she said.",
      "Shields couldn't help but think about what her life would be like if she took home silver instead of gold.",
      "\"As I was walking to the ring for my final fight at the Olympics, I was telling myself, 'If you get silver, maybe you won\u2019t have so many fakers and doubters and all this weird stuff around that you don\u2019t want. But if you get gold, it\u2019s going to be all of these people that are gonna come into your life. All these new cousins and all this new stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"I had to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to get gold or silver because the power was in my hands,\" Shields continued. \"Then right before I got into the ring, I took a deep breath and I was like, 'You know what? I\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this gold medal, and however my life changes after this, I\u2019m just going to accept it and deal with it the best way I can. There is no way I\u2019m about to miss out on this opportunity because I\u2019m scared of how many fake people will come around.\u201d",
      "Shields added that people still walk up to her to this day and tell her that they lost money betting against her in the finals.",
      "Was Claressa Shields involved in the \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "Yes, Shields served as an executive producer in \"The Fire Inside\" and she told Entertainment Weekly that she had \"a lot of input\" in how the film was made.",
      "\"Before Barry (Jenkins) wrote the script, we met in person and talked for almost five hours. I let him speak first about what he thought my story was, and when he got done talking, I said, 'Well, you had a few key parts, but this is what I want to tell, what I want them to understand about me,\" she said. \"When he wrote his script a few months later and sent it to me, he got it just right.\"",
      "Shields also hailed Destiny's acting in the film and said she did a \"great job\" playing her in \"The Fire Inside.\"",
      "\"I cry every time I watch the movie,\" Shields said.",
      "What is Claressa Shields doing now?",
      "After the 2016 Olympics, Shields went pro and became a five weight world champion. She reminded ESPN of her accolades when it left her off a list of \"trailblazing\" female athletes that aired on the channel.",
      "In response, Shields took to X to share the ESPN graphic along with a picture of herself holding her championship belts.",
      "In the caption, she wrote, \"Wow @espn. Y\u2019all have really lost yall mind!!!!! Do I have to run my resume down to y\u2019all!!! 2x Olympic champ, 3x Undisputed champ, 5 weight world champion, 15x world champ. WOMENS BOXING TRAIL BLAZER.\"",
      "Shields has since gotten involved in the Mixed Martial Arts scene. In 2021, she made her MMA debut in a fight that she won against Brittney Elkin.",
      "When asked why she wanted to do MMA, Shields told Yahoo Sports in 2021 that she felt like she \"never got her just due in boxing.\" At the time, Shields was a 12-time world champion. She is now a 15-time world champ.",
      "\"You think about becoming a 22-time world champion. It's very easy for myself to do, but it was like, 'What would that do for me? Would that make me a bigger star? Would that make me a household name? Or would that make me a millionaire?'\" she said. \"And the truth is no. It wouldn't open up any more doors to me than what has already been opened.\"",
      "\"I would have to keep fighting this war of equal pay and equal opportunity and getting women equal fight time,\" she continued. \"It just got to a place where I was like, you know what, I've been working so hard and boxing for so many years that if I'm going to work hard at something then at least let me reap what I sow.\""

      "\u201cBack when I wrote \u2018It Ends With Us,\u2019 the new adult (genre) was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That\u2019s what I was contracted to do.

Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",
      "Lively said in a statement, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one dessert that\u2019s the talk of Tinseltown around the holidays: the so-called \u201cTom Cruise cake.\u201d",
      "The white chocolate coconut Bundt cake from the family-owned Doan\u2019s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California got its nickname because the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d star famously gifts the dessert to his Hollywood friends at the end of every year.",
      "In 2018, Cruise said on \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201c that he likes to send cakes to people because he doesn\u2019t consume sugar while training.",
      "So, instead of treating himself during the holidays, he treats his costars and colleagues to the coconut cake with chunks of white chocolate covered in cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut shavings.",
      "Who has received the Tom Cruise cake?",
      "Cruise\u2019s gift list reads like an awards show roll call: Renee Zellweger, Graham Norton, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Henry Cavill, Kirsten Dunst, Cobie Smulders, Jimmy Fallon, Jon Hamm and Angela Bassett are just a small selection of folks who have spoken publicly about receiving the cake.",
      "Brooke Shields famously spoke about being removed from the list for reasons unknown to her, and Tom Hanks said his ideal \u201clast meal\u201d would include the cake.",
      "This year is no different: On Dec. 13, Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d costar Glen Powell shared a photo of the cake on his Instagram story, writing, \u201cThe Cruise Cake has arrived.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 19, Mindy Kaling shared a photo of the cake on her Instagram story with the caption \u201cIykyk\u201d (an abbreviation for the phrase \u201cIf you know, you know\u201d).",
      "Singer Victoria Canal also got a Cruise cake this year and tried a bite of it on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rich,\u201d Canal says in the video. \u201cLike Tom Cruise.\u201d",
      "The pastry is so famous, it was immortalized in HBO comedy series \u201cHacks.\u201d\u00a0 In the Season 3 premiere, fictional superstar comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) is lucky enough to be sent one of the cakes, which is immediately clocked by her protege Ava (Hannah Einbinder).",
      "Where does the Tom Cruise cake come from?",
      "The cake was invented by Karen Doan, who established Doan\u2019s Bakery in 1983 by baking desserts for restaurants, coffee houses, caterers and private events. According to the bakery\u2019s website, 25 years ago, Karen, her son Eric and his wife Carrie opened the bakery to the public. Karen died in 2023, and Eric now runs the bakery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing seeing it go from my grandma renting out kitchens, making wholesale cakes for her friend\u2019s restaurant in \u201883 to now,\u201d Alexis Doan, Eric\u2019s daughter, tells TODAY.com. Alexis acts as the store manager and assists during the busy holiday season.",
      "Alexis says that Cruise orders around 300 to 400 cakes from the bakery every year, adding that the bakery doesn\u2019t ship them out, so they\u2019re unaware who in Hollywood is actually receiving them.",
      "How to get the cake for yourself",
      "Doan\u2019s Bakery also sells the dessert through Goldbelly for $129.95 including shipping. Alexis says if you pick it up in person, the cake, which has 12 to 16 servings, costs $59.",
      "The bakery also sells a medium size that serves six to eight people for $39 and an individual portion for $9.",
      "Although there\u2019s a markup on Goldbelly, it\u2019s proven super popular there and is sold out through late-February. The bakery ships out roughly 50 cakes per day, five days a week through the online marketplace.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s not including storefront, which totally varies, depending on the holiday,\u201d Alexis says.",
      "Goldbelly says it\u2019s been working with Doan\u2019s for more than five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most loved cakes on our site and we\u2019re thrilled to bring the magic of their white chocolate coconut cake to the world,\u201d Joe Ariel, founder and CEO of Goldbelly, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNow you no longer need to be a celebrity to order or gift someone the famous \u2018Tom Cruise Cake.\u2019\u201d",
      "If you want a celebrity coconut cake and can\u2019t wait until after Valentine\u2019s Day, Ina Garten has a get-it-sooner alternative on Goldbelly. Her coconut layer cake has a hint of almond and is layered with cream cheese icing and coated in shredded coconut, and will arrive at your door before the ball drops, for $99.95.",
      "Why does Tom Cruise love this cake?",
      "In a 2021 interview with Spectrum News, Karen recounts the story of how Cruise came to order so many cakes from their family-run business. As the story goes, Diane Keaton introduced the cake to Katie Holmes during the filming of \u201cMad Money\u201d in 2008. Holmes was married to Cruise at the time.",
      "\u201cSo when Tom and Katie had a big party at their new home in Beverly Hills, we did all the cakes,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThey loved it.\u201d",
      "Ever since then, Cruise has given the cake out every year \u2014 and word gets around.",
      "\u201cPeople do call it that,\u201d Alexis says, adding that while people come in asking for the Tom Cruise cake, they take special care to not advertise it that way. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what they call it, but out of respect for him, we just call it the White Chocolate Coconut Cake. We don\u2019t want to use him as publicity.\u201d",
      "How does it taste?",
      "On Dec. 13, the TODAY anchors tried the iconic cake for themselves. During PopStart, TODAY cohost Carson Daly served up the treat, which is known to be moist, buttery and coconutty, to the group.",
      "\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Al Roker asked Carson, who replied that he got the cake from Goldbelly \u2014 not from Cruise (this year, at least).",
      "\u201cMmm,\u201d Hoda Kotb says while taking multiple bites of cake. \u201cI love it. Wow.\u201d",
      "The hosts all seemed to enjoy their slices, and Al said, \u201cThat\u2019s good cake.\u201d"

      "Their story is loosely told in \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d or \u201cThe Freaks,\u201d a drama in theaters Dec. 25, starring Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0newcomer Eros de la Puente. Written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \u201cThe Peanut Butter Falcon,\u201d the Spanish-language film begins with the following message:",
      "\u201cIn 1961, Fidel Castro outlawed rock music in Cuba. For decades, only the boldest performers played \u2018the music of the enemy\u2019 in secret. The most extreme members of this movement became known as Los Frikis.\u201d",
      "Inspired by true events, \u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the coming-of-age story of Gustavo (de la Puente), who idolizes his older brother Paco (Medina) and his rock music-loving friends. Poor and starving during a period of scarcity in Cuba, Paco and his friends inject themselves with HIV so they can be sent to a government-run sanitarium where they can have full meals, freedom and listen to and play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "\u201c(There) they experience freedom and joy and a full belly for the first time in their lifetime,\u201d Arjona tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a joyful, beautiful ride of these two brothers coming together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s incredibly, incredibly heartbreaking as well.\u201d",
      "Miller, along with producer Phil Lord and actors Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0Eros de la Puente, break down the incredible story of resilience and endurance told in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "A harrowing time in Cuba",
      "In 1989, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba\u2019s economy took a turn for the worse. The country entered its decadeslong depression known as the \u201cSpecial Period,\u201d when food and fuel shortages affected the population.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d shows the struggles that many people faced at that time and the extreme measures they took to survive. Early on there's a scene where Paco makes his brother catch and kill a cat so they can eat it. Gustavo doesn\u2019t have the stomach to do it.",
      "\u201cYou have to learn how to take care of yourself, OK!\u201d Paco sternly tells his brother. \u201cWake up! We live in Cuba!\u201d",
      "A 1989 New York Times article wrote about \u201cstarvation in Cuba,\u201d where it said \u201ccats and dogs there, and even iguanas and snakes, have been eaten.\u201d",
      "At the same time, as the AIDS epidemic spread in the '80s, HIV testing began in Cuba in 1986, according to The New York Times. Cuba took strict measures to combat the spread by frequently testing people for HIV and offering free basic health care, as well as forcing people who tested positive to quarantine in the sanitariums.",
      "The self-infected Frikis knew that if they were sent to the sanitariums they would be provided with food, shelter and the freedom to listen and play their music.",
      "\u201cThe thing that we were trying to do was make sure that it wasn\u2019t sensationalizing (people injecting themselves with HIV) and presenting what was happening in a matter of fact, letting the story tell you what was going on without trying to push it,\u201d producer Chris Miller tells TODAY.com. \u201cBecause what really happened is so outrageous, you don\u2019t need to do anything extra to make it seem outrageous. So it was really about trying to underplay it as much as possible.\u201d",
      "While the sanitariums kept people infected with the disease away from their families, people formed lifelong friendships and the places kept the spread to a minimum.",
      "According to a 2007 study, Cuba had one of the world\u2019s smallest HIV epidemics. Its infection rate was 0.1 %, the lowest HIV prevalence in the Caribbean, per the study. In 2015, Cuba became the first country to receive validation from the World Health Organization that it had eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.",
      "Who were 'Los Frikis'?",
      "Los Frikis were a group of punk rockers who rejected communist Cuba, loved rock music (which was banned by Fidel Castro) and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll style. They also were outcasts, many of whom were of the LGBTQ community.",
      "Niurka Fuentes' late husband, Papo La Bala, was one of the first Frikis, and injected himself with the virus. She told Vice in 2017, \u201cHe knew that he would meet other people like him in there, the police would leave him alone, and he would be able to live his life in peace.\u201d",
      "Papo La Bala was quoted as saying, per the metal music magazine Metal Hammer, \u201cI gave myself AIDS \u2014 and many others like me \u2014 because we were the most persecuted class in the entire country. The police fell hardest on us. All the laws were against us. It was a level of discrimination completely without democracy.\u201d",
      "Another Friki, Yoandra Cardoso, also told Vice, \u201cYou could hear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u00a0heavy metal coming from every house. When the sanatorium first opened, it was 100\u00a0percent Frikis \u2026 we were all here together.\u201d",
      "At the time, there wasn\u2019t much information about HIV and AIDS. Cuba would seek cures and treatment. Patients at sanitariums could volunteer to be the test subjects, which is depicted in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it was very important for this movie to make sure that people know how desperate you actually have to be in order to make that choice,\u201d de la Puente, who was born in Cuba, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Growing up in Cuba, Medina was very aware of the Frikis and even knew some of them.",
      "\u201cI spoke with a drummer who was in a band in Cuba,\u201d the 35-year-old says in Spanish about his research. \u201cHe told me about his friendships, that period, how they would try to find phone cords to use as guitar strings ... It was very interesting how they would find ways to play music.\u201d",
      "He also spoke with a medical professional who worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium southwest of Havana, who recalled seeing his patient-turned-friends die of AIDS.",
      "The message behind 'Los Frikis'",
      "Producer Phil Lord wanted the movie to speak of the current moment but go beyond politics.",
      "\u201cWe wanted it to be something universal about how you find your freedom, who you find it with, how you stay together under adversity, how families carry on in adverse circumstances,\u201d the Cuban American filmmaker tells TODAY.com. \u201c(It\u2019s) the story of these two brothers... it was going to be funny and warm, even though, ostensibly, the topic is devastating.\u201d",
      "Producer Chris Miller adds that the movie is about \u201cfinding hope in a hopeless situation.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 17:03:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Martin Short and Melissa McCarthy teamed up for an aggressive approach to getting the last parking spot during a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch with Mikey Day and Chloe Fineman.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d brought back a fan favorite sketch, this time with a holiday twist.",
      "Martin Short hosted the late night sketch comedy show on Dec. 21 alongside musical guest, Hozier. The episode featured the sketch \u201cParking Lot Altercation,\u201d which served as a callback to when Quinta Brunson hosted in April 2023.",
      "The \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star and creator appeared in a similar sketch called \u201cTraffic Altercation,\u201d wherein she and Mikey Day engaged in some animated and often inappropriate gesturing while they were stuck in a traffic jam on the highway.",
      "This time, Short competed with Day for a parking lot spot at a mall on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.",
      "At the beginning of their exchange, the men try to reasonably communicate their ownership over the spot, with Day insisting that the spot was his with some simple gesturing, while Short claimed that his blinker was on, as conveyed by his aggressive blinking.",
      "Tensions escalated from there, with Day claiming that he reached the spot first, to which Short accused him of being blind. The sketch continued to take dark and inappropriate turns as their argument over the parking spot continued without resolution. At one point, Day\u2019s daughter, portrayed by Chloe Fineman, got involved, albeit with some NSFW gestures.",
      "Day accused Short of being a liar after sharing that he was handicapped due to his high blood pressure, using his hand to gesture his nose growing \u00e0 la Pinocchio. Short responded by claiming he would never lie because he was a \u201csuper Christian\u201d as represented by him doing his best Superman stance and then holding his arms out as if he were on the cross.",
      "Eventually, Short said that if Day wouldn\u2019t listen to him, then maybe he would listen to his wife, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy. Though Day initially didn\u2019t see Short\u2019s wife, McCarthy came in hot on the scene and started to bang on the passenger side window.",
      "\u201cDrive away right now or I will kill you, now,\u201d she threatened the father-daughter duo. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make your dumb daughter watch.\u201d",
      "After the threats intensified, McCarthy paused to take a sip of an iced coffee before promptly spitting it back out onto the window.",
      "Day and Fineman could barely keep it together as McCarthy used her chest to wipe off the beverage from the window, pausing every few seconds to glare at them before pressing her chest against the window again. At one point, she even licked a line clean off the window so she could get a better look at the duo before creeping away.",
      "That was the final straw in the argument as Day ultimately surrendered the spot to Short who seemed overjoyed by the win.",
      "McCarthy wasn\u2019t the only celebrity cameo during last night\u2019s episode.",
      "The show kicked-off with a star-studded cold open that saw Short being inducted into the Five-Timers Club.",
      "The sketch featured several members of the club, including Tom Hanks, Paul Rudd, Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Wiig, Emma Stone, and John Mulaney.",
      "Though not a member of the club, Jimmy Fallon presented Short with his honorary purple velvet jacket and Colin Jost tried to enter with his wife, Johansson, but she ditched him for the shindig and shut the door in his face.",
      "Rudd appeared in several sketches throughout the night, including during the \u201cS\u00e1bado Gigante Christmas Special\u201d alongside Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez and as himself during the \u201cChristmas Airport Parade.\u201d McCarthy played a gate agent in the sketch, while Hanks appeared not at himself but as Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, a nod to the 2016 film \u201cSully.\u201d"

It\u2019s as horrifying as it is destructive.\u201d",

      "Online, the volume of a single question surrounding the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d rollout has gone steadily up in the week leading up to the release: Why hasn\u2019t star and director Baldoni been pictured with the rest of the cast?",
      "People on social media have dissected cast appearances and events. At the New York movie premiere Aug. 6, Lively was photographed with an ensemble, including her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and his \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d co-star Hugh Jackman. She also posed with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-stars Brandon Sklenar and Jenny Slate. Baldoni appeared only with his wife, Emily Baldoni, or alone.",
      "Fans also noticed that Lively and Hoover do not follow Baldoni on Instagram, but they follow each other and other cast members like Sklenar and Slate.",
      "Since then, fans have began to speculate about possible tension between Baldoni and Lively. Baldoni did not partake in many group engagements with the cast to promote the film, often doing interviews solo, while Lively was paired with one or more other cast members. Fans on TikTok and YouTube were quick to note Baldoni\u2019s noticeable absence from Vanity Fair\u2019s interview with Lively and five other central actors in the film.",
      "This is part of a trend of fans close-reading press tours by analyzing interviews, red carpet interactions, body language and more for insight into cast dynamics. \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d press tour in 2023, for example, was clouded by rumors of a rift between star Taraji P. Henson and executive producer Oprah Winfrey, which they both denied. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d from 2022, was similarly overshadowed by a rumored feud between the cast and the relationship between a star (Harry Styles) and director (Olivia Wilde).",
      "What have \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 cast members said about an alleged feud?",
      "On Aug. 20, Sklenar became the first cast member to address any perceived iciness.",
      "\u201cColleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in part. \u201cVilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strong in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point. What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film. It\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni have not commented, though Baldoni has spoken highly about Lively and the contributions she made on the film.",
      "During a TODAY appearance Aug. 8, Baldoni said of the movie star: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know how smart and creative she really is. I think she\u2019s best known as an actress and of course she\u2019s a fashion icon, but she\u2019s so much more than that. She\u2019s dynamic, creative. She had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched, she made better.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com that took place after his broadcast appearance, Baldoni spoke to the extent of Lively impact on the movie, along with her husband\u2019s.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t summarize Blake\u2019s contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cRyan (Reynolds) was so generous ... he\u2019s a creative genius, that guy. So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in heading the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "As for Lively, she has not mentioned Baldoni in interviews, though she has been open about her creative touches seen in \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d In an interview with Hits Radio UK on Aug. 11, said she and people involved in the film disagreed over featuring Lana Del Ray\u2019s song \u201cCherry.\u201d Lively was strongly for it, while others were against it \u2014 though she added, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be talking about this.\u201d",
      "Lively on TODAY said she sourced her character Lily\u2019s clothes from her own wardrobe, as well from her friend Gigi Hadid\u2019s and Reynolds\u2019. And in an interview with E! News on the red carpet, Lively revealed her husband wrote the rooftop scene, where Ryle and Lily first meet.",
      "Why did Blake Lively sue Justin Baldoni?",
      "In December 2024, over four months after \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d premiered, Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint, which was obtained by TODAY.com, that she experienced sexual harassment in addition to retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and more.",
      "In the complaint, Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the CEO of Wayfarer Studios and producer on the film, were said to have engaged in \u201cinappropriate and unwelcome behavior\u201d toward Lively and other individuals on the set of the film.",
      "These claims included ignoring industry safeguards for filming intimate scenes, adding in \u201cgratuitous sexual content,\u201d discussing personal sexual experiences, and objectifying women, including Lively.",
      "The complaint also noted that Baldoni and his team proceeded to \u201cformulate a retaliatory plan\u201d due to knowledge the Wayfarer Studios had of the HR complaints made against the actor and Heath\u2019s behavior. It also stated that Baldoni retaliated because the complaints \u201cthreatened his feminist brand.\u201d",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint that due to an \u201cincrease in negative media articles and social media coverage,\u201d she, her family and her businesses all \u201csuffered\u201d and were \u201csubstantially harmed\u201d by Wayfarer Studios\u2019 actions.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children,\u201d the complaint read in part. \u201cThere are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to the complaint in a statement to TODAY.com, sharing that they were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Does \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 romanticize abuse?",
      "While current chatter around \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d surrounds the cast, the story itself has generated controversy. Previously, discourse revolved around its delivery of a heavy subject matter.",
      "Hoover has shared publicly that the story was inspired by her mom, who left her abusive husband (and Hoover\u2019s biological father) when Hoover was 2.",
      "A common criticism of the book was that it romanticized abuse.\u00a0An op-ed published to a domestic shelters non-profit said the BookTok favorite \u201cfeeds into the very structures of toxic masculinity that it purports to combat\u201d by \u201cromanticizing red flags\u201d and glorifies a \u201ccharismatic-but-dangerous man.\u201d",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Baldoni said he and screenwriter Christy Hall made a concerted effort to take criticism into account \u201cfrom the very beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe talked about the criticism. We talked about why that happened. We talked about what we can do to protect the movie from that criticism, and how we can make sure that we inject as much truth into it, so that people can be seen and never feel like their stories are being exploited,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said he \u201ccompletely understands\u201d the criticism.",
      "\u201cI want to validate and support anybody and everybody who\u2019s come out against the book, because the last thing we need is to romanticize something that is such a real experience for so many people\u201d",
      "Baldoni took input from the domestic violence organization No More while making the film and also attended a support group for perpetrators to try to better understand their psychology.",
      "As a result of their effort, the movie changes one of the most controversial plot points from the book: the end of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship.",
      "In the book, although Lily leaves Ryle, he stays part of their daughter\u2019s life and watches her unsupervised for days on end. In the movie, Ryle isn\u2019t seen on screen after their daughter is born at the hospital.",
      "Baldoni told The Wrap the script\u2019s original draft had a scene that involved Ryle dropping off their child and having a short conversation with Lily.",
      "\u201cIt was written in a way that showed that they\u2019ve overcome a lot over the last two years. And I wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "Does the movie\u2019s marketing match its tone?",
      "Some are saying the movie\u2019s packaging is discordant with its subject matter.",
      "\u201cIf you just watch the trailer for this movie \u2026 it looks like a romance,\u201d as pop culture TikToker Jess Spoll said.",
      "The poster sees Lily smiling and surrounded by flowers. The original cover art for the movie took on a different tone. In it, Lily and Ryle stand close together in an embrace. Lily\u2019s face is in focus and she appears to wear an ambiguous impression.",
      "A post shared by It Ends With Us (@itendswithusmovie)",
      "Readers of the book often experienced a similar surprise, like this TikTok points to: \u201cReading \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 thinking it is a cute romance,\u201d the text reads \u2014 before things change, and the true nature of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship emerges.",
      "Since the film's release, people started taking issue with Lively\u2019s promotion of the film.",
      "\u201cJustin is promoting the movie as it is, which is about DV (domestic violence), it\u2019s a very heavy topic, it\u2019s what the book focuses on,\u201d Meredith Mansfield says in a now-viral TikTok video. \u201cWhereas Blake and everybody else are promoting it like a rom-com and that\u2019s rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.\u201d",
      "Mansfield cited an interview with Lively where she suggested people \u201cgrab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see\u201d the film.",
      "In another viral video, TikToker Ashley Paige, who goes by @livingsingle and says she\u2019s a survivor of domestic abuse, addressed Lively in a 5-minute-long video.",
      "\u201cIn this video, you represented us... it\u2019s your job, right?\u201d she said, going on to cite domestic violence statistics in the United States.",
      "\u201cAnd you have the audacity to show up to the premiere and tell your audience and have influencers promote it like it\u2019s the sequel to \u2018Barbie,\u2019\u201d Paige said. \u201cYou could\u2019ve gone about this so differently, in such a respectful, tactful, gentle, understanding, advocacy-bringing awareness manner.\u201d",
      "Paige seemed to be responding, at least in part, to an Aug. 9 interview Lively did with the BBC where she said that \u201cwhat\u2019s important about the film\u201d is that her character Lily is \u201cnot just a victim.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile those are huge things to be, she\u2019s not defined by something that someone else did to her or an event that happened to her, even if it\u2019s multiple events,\u201d Lively said. \u201cShe defines herself and I think that\u2019s deeply empowering to remind people that no one else can define you. No experience can define you, you define you.\u201d",
      "How have cast members reacted to marketing criticism?",
      "Sklenar also addressed criticism surrounding promotion of the movie in his Aug. 20 Instagram post:",
      "\u201cTrust me when I tell you, there isn\u2019t a single person involved in the making of this film that was not aware of the responsibility we had in making this. A responsibility to all the women who have experienced generational trauma \u2014 domestic abuse \u2014 or struggle with looking in the mirror and loving who they see. This movie is a harsh reality check for the men who need to get their s\u2014 together and take responsibility for themselves and their actions.\u201d",
      "Lively nor Baldoni have spoken out directly, though Lively on her Instagram story Aug. 13 thanked viewers for seeing the movie and \u201cgetting a message so important out there to the masses.\u201d",
      "In a second post on her Instagram story that same day, she shared the link and phone number to the National Domestic Violence Hotline with the following caption:",
      "\u201c1 in 4 women aged 18 and older in the US alone have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Intimate partner violence affects all genders, including more than 12 million people every year in the United States.\u201d",
      "What happened with the coloring book?",
      "\ufeffIn 2023, Hoover announced \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was becoming a coloring book, a move that was immediately criticized by fans who said the medium didn\u2019t fit the tone. A day later, plans for the book were canceled, and Hoover acknowledged fan feedback.",
      "\u201cThe coloring book was developed with Lily\u2019s strength in mind, but I can absolutely see how this was tone-deaf,\u201d Hoover wrote in part.",
      "Merch related to the book has continued, however. In April 2024, Hoover released a line of long-lasting nail polish and press-ons with Olive and June. Colors are named after the book\u2019s characters, as well as other books of hers (though there isn\u2019t a Ryle nail polish).",
      "Lively also launched in tandem with the movie\u2019s release a new product: her hair care line at Target.",
      "The characters\u2019 ages",
      "When the casting was announced in 2023, fans of the book immediately took issue with Lively and Baldoni portraying the main characters.",
      "At 36, Lively is older than the book\u2019s version of Lily, who is written to be 23. Ryle is about 30.",
      "Hoover told TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager in 2023 that she made a \u201cmistake\u201d with the characters\u2019 ages in the book and that both should be older, especially given Ryle is a neurosurgeon.",
      "\u201cAs an author, we make mistakes,\u201d she explained in her interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no 28-year-old neurosurgeons, you know? You go to school for 15 years. And so to make corrections to what I messed up in the book, we aged the characters up somewhat.\u201d"

The document states the actor later participated in \u201castroturfing\u201d \u2014 defined in the complaint as the deceptive practice of orchestrating a smear campaign under the guise of the public \u2014 as well as a coordinated PR effort to \"destroy\" her reputation.",

      "During the meeting, according to the complaint, Baldoni and Heath were asked to stop showing nude videos and images of women to Lively and others and to stop discussing their past \u201cpornography addiction\u201d as well as their \u201cpersonal experiences of sex\u201d in front of her and others.",
      "Lively also requested that Baldoni and Heath stop describing their own \u201cgenitalia\u201d in front of others.",

      "Lively\u2019s complaint also notes that after the movie was released, Baldoni engaged in a \u201csocial manipulation\u201d campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation that caused her and her family \u201csevere emotional distress.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",

      "\u201cWayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorneys claim that Lively\u2019s team allegedly made up stories about Baldoni to the press before the marketing of the film had even begun.",

      "After social media users noted that Baldoni did not pose with Lively \u2014 or any of the movie\u2019s other stars \u2014 at the film\u2019s Aug. 6 premiere in New York, rumors of tensions among the cast circulated online.",
      "The chatter escalated when fans noticed that Lively and author Hoover followed each other and other cast members \u2014 but not Baldoni \u2014 on Instagram.",
      "Baldoni also didn\u2019t participate in group promotional events with the movie\u2019s actors, opting instead to do his interviews with the media alone. Meanwhile, Lively often joined other cast members to speak to the media, including a high-profile Vanity Fair interview that featured Lively and five other actors from the film \u2014 but not Baldoni.",
      "Lively and Baldoni never publicly commented about their alleged feud, and Baldoni notably praised Lively during an Aug. 8 appearance on TODAY for her \u201csmart and creative\u201d contributions to his film.",

      "After first premiering in 1994, the NBC sitcom would go on to earn six Primetime Emmys (including an outstanding supporting actress statue for Kudrow) and go down in history as one of the most popular TV shows of all time. The meteoric success and continued popularity of \"Friends\" are due in no small part to the chemistry of its six co-stars, something Kudrow says was genuine.",
      "\u201cWe loved each other,\u201d Kudrow says. \u201cGoing to work every day was heaven. It was too good to be true, but it really was.\u201d",
      "An Encino, California native, acting wasn\u2019t initially on Kudrow\u2019s radar. Instead, she attended Vassar, where she graduated with a biology degree and plans for a career in research before trying her hand at comedy. The risk paid off, and after a successful audition Kudrow earned a coveted spot in the Groundlings, a Los Angeles-based sketch comedy group.",
      "Before long, she made the leap to television, nabbing a recurring role as a scatterbrained server named Ursula on the popular \u201890s sitcom \u201cMad About You\" before landing \u201cFriends.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll I ever wanted to do was be able to support myself as an actor. That was the goal,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. She continues that the massive juggernaut that was \u201cFriends\u201d went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d anything she\u2019d ever hoped for.",
      "\u201cNot only that, but I was working with people that I loved,\u201d says Kudrow of her time on the show.",
      "Kudrow says that among the benefits of having been a part of one of the most celebrated sitcoms of all time is that \u201cFriends\u201d has afforded her the ability to pursue her own projects, including the mockumentary \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d Showtime\u2019s \u201cWeb Therapy\u201d and the ancestry documentary she's produced, \u201cWho Do You Think You Are?\u201d",
      "\"Because I was on 'Friends,' I got to create my own shows that didn't have to be as big as 'Friends,' so I could do something like 'The Comeback' or 'Web Therapy,' and that was really fulfilling.\"",
      "Filming 'No Good Deed' without an ending",
      "In her new Netflix series, \"No Good Deed,\" Kudrow stars as Lydia Morgan, a Los Angeles suburbanite who's selling her home in the aftermath of losing a son.",
      "The dark comedy also stars Romano as Kudrow's husband, Paul, and Denis Leary as his recently paroled brother, along with a host of others, including Luke Wilson, Linda Cardellini and O-T Fagbenle, who portray property-hungry buyers willing to do anything to score the Morgans' prized Spanish-style mansion. All of them have something to hide, including Lydia and Paul.",
      "\"Their son is dead and it's a secret. What was their involvement in that?\" says Kudrow, who explains that she was initially drawn to the role because she enjoys a mystery.",
      "\"I like when the information is teased in a way that makes sense, but definitely feels like, 'Oh, I know exactly what's going on here, but I need to know more.' And then you get more and maybe it's not that,\" she says. \"It felt like a fun ride to me.\"",
      "Part whodunit and part send-up of the LA scene, \"No Good Deed\" keeps viewers guessing about the hidden motives of all its characters right up until the very end. Even Kudrow and Romano were kept in the dark about the finale of \"No Good Deed\" until they were more than halfway through shooting the series.",
      "\"We didn't know,\" says Kudrow of the show's conclusion. That left it up to Romano to ask showrunner and creator Liz Feldman to reveal the ending.",
      "\"Around Episode Five, Ray went to Liz and just said, 'We're playing these people. The characters know exactly what happened, but we don't. So, don't you think we should know?'\" explains Kudrow, saying that the request prompted Feldman to wrap up the final details of the ending before sending it over to her lead actors.",
      "\"And then it was a big surprise,\" she says of finally learning the outcome of \"No Good Deed.\"",
      "Will 'No Good Deed' return for Season 2?",
      "After watching the finale, fans of the series may be wondering if there will be another season.",
      "According to Kudrow, Season Two of \"No Good Deed\" has yet to be decided. \"It's up to Netflix and Liz, what she wants to do with it next,\" says Kudrow. \"If she thinks it's worth it and there's room for me and Ray, I'm not saying no. I loved everybody. Luke was so great. Linda was great.\"",
      "As for what comes next, Kudrow says she wouldn't mind taking on a \"slice-of-life\" drama similar to \"Scenes from a Marriage\" or other dramatic role.",
      "\"Maybe a mystery,\" she says. \"But that's not apocalyptic or overly tragic.\""

      "Throughout the past year, rumors have been flying that the best friends were no longer such. Now, each of them are speaking out to explain their sides of the story and how their friendship broke down. Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to LaPaglia and O\u2019Malley respectively for additional comment.",
      "Who are Brianna LaPaglia and Grace O\u2019Malley?",
      "LaPaglia, 25, and O\u2019Malley, 26, had been best friends growing up in Massachusetts and had together hosted the \u201cPlan Bri Uncut\u201d podcast under Barstool Sports.",
      "LaPaglia also co-hosts Barstool\u2019s \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast and spoke in a Dec. 11 episode about starting the \u201cPlan Bri\u201d podcast solo from her dorm room as a college advice show. When LaPaglia moved to New York to pursue the podcast with Barstool, she invited O\u2019Malley to move with her. O\u2019Malley eventually became co-host of \u201cPlan Bri\u201d and had been for the last two years, according to LaPaglia.",
      "LaPaglia had went through a public breakup with country music star Zach Bryan in the fall. In a Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia had reflected on the split and accused Bryan of \u201cnarcissistic, emotional abuse for a year.\u201d (Bryan has not responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims. He and LaPaglia did not return TODAY.com\u2019s requests for additional comment at the time.)",
      "As for O\u2019Malley, she is pursuing a career in comedy. She opened several shows for Whitney Cummings on her \u201cBig Baby Tour\u201d this fall. She\u2019s now on her own stand-up tour that goes into the spring.",
      "After her fallout with LaPaglia, O\u2019Malley said in a statement on her Instagram story Dec. 16 that she was parting ways with Barstool. On Dec. 19, O\u2019Malley and the Unwell Network, headed by podcaster (and former Barstool talent) Alex Cooper, said she was joining the Unwell family. They did not provide details about what that entails.",
      "When did Brianna Chickenfry and Grace O\u2019Malley\u2019s fallout happen?",
      "It\u2019s unclear when exactly O\u2019Malley and LaPaglia\u2019s friendship began to falter.",
      "However, fans began to speculate that something was amiss with the duo after O\u2019Malley celebrated her 26th birthday in October. She posted on Instagram a myriad of photos with friends, thanking them for celebrating with her.",
      "\u201ci had myself one of the best birthdays of all time,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cthank you so very kindly to all of you sweeties who reached out and showed out. much love xoxo.\u201d",
      "LaPaglia was not pictured in any of the photos. Plus, \u201cPlan Bri\u201d hadn\u2019t had a new episode since Oct. 10, leading fans to wonder if something was amiss.",
      "What has Brianna Chickenfry said?",
      "Some had speculated that LaPaglia\u2019s relationship with Bryan had caused a strain in hers with O\u2019Malley. When LaPaglia opened up about her breakup with Bryan on the Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d co-host Dave Portnoy asked LaPaglia how her friendship with O\u2019Malley was now that she and Bryan split.",
      "\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Grace will always be fine.\u201d",
      "Then in the Dec. 12 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia shared that she and O\u2019Malley were indeed on the outs and opened up about her side of the story.",
      "She said about a year and a half ago, the internet began pitting her and O\u2019Malley against each other. Then when she began dating Bryan, that relationship formed a \u201cwedge\u201d in her friendship with O\u2019Malley.",
      "\u201cBut she knew that this was the worst year of my life,\u201d LaPaglia said. \u201cThis is when the internet started attacking me. They only lift Grace up when they're beating me down. ... It was, like, whatever because it helped her career, and she was fine and happy about it. But it got to a point where she was, like, never defending me.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can hate (Bryan), but you can still be there for me,\u201d LaPaglia added. \u201cAnd she never was.\u201d",
      "LaPaglia claimed she went to O\u2019Malley in May and asked her to defend her online. She said O\u2019Malley responded by saying she knows the truth and that LaPaglia has supported her.",
      "\u201cOn top of everything that I was going through, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended our friendship \u2014 I was like, I have to take a step away from this because it was, like, months of me being like, Grace, can you just defend me?\u201d",
      "\u201cI needed her so bad, and I know she needed me too during that year. She felt like I left her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying these are two separate conversations,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryone's saying Grace deserves better, Grace lost her best friend. But I lost my best friend too. ... I brought her along for everything in my life. I gave her everything, and I would do it all over again. ... But when things get hard, and she knew what I was going through, I really needed her.\u201d",
      "She then commented on their work dynamic on \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do the podcast anymore because we\u2019re sitting there pretending to be friends. ... I needed to set a boundary \u2014 I can\u2019t continue this show anymore. So I ended the show.\u201d",
      "What has Grace O\u2019Malley said?",
      "O\u2019Malley hasn\u2019t responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims on the \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast about what she says led to their fallout. According to Portnoy, who\u2019s also the founder of Barstool, he asked O\u2019Malley to come on \u201cBFFs\u201d to explain her side of the story, but she declined.",
      "O\u2019Malley has, however, spoken out about \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "In early December, LaPaglia posted an Instagram story when \u201cPlan Bri\u201d made Spotify Wrapped\u2019s \u201cBreakout Creators of 2024\u201d list. She wrote: \u201cworking on bringing back some version of Planbri guys.\u201d",
      "This elicited a response from O\u2019Malley. She posted on her Instagram story Dec. 6 that she was unaware of LaPaglia\u2019s effort to bring back \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",
      "She said:",
      "hi guys! if you know me you know i truly hate having to be serious about anything ever, but sometimes you just have to be. so, here it is (can you tell i\u2019m trying to stall even in this weird notes app post)",
      "for months i\u2019ve been radio silent about the status of plan bri and it has killed me to leave you guys hanging. the plan was for brianna and me to put out a joint statement about the end of the podcast.",
      "everything\u2019s so weird and unfamiliar at the moment so i\u2019ve just waited for the cue to put that out.",
      "seeing all of you tag us in your spotify wrapped made me feel a few things: proud of what we\u2019ve built, nostalgic for all these years, and frankly outright heartbroken that this chapter is closed. but, we agreed to make a joint statement, so i replied, cried, and chose not to repost or saying anything until it was time.",
      "on that same day, you may have seen brianna post that she\u2019s \u201cworking on bring back some version\u201d of plan bri. to give you guys the much needed info you deserve, all i can say is that that was my first time hearing about this.",
      "so, i feel as if it\u2019s only fair to share my piece about all this jazz with you now.",
      "my favorite part of this chapter of my life was not only all of you, but also getting to work with my best friend. it has truly been a dream job and i\u2019m eternally grateful to both brianna & barstool for giving me the opportunity to work on such a fantastic show with an even better team.",
      "this last year, i\u2019ve bit my tongue so much that i shouldn\u2019t have one anymore. i was willing to wait out of respect, but things don\u2019t always work out the way you think they will. in fact they rarely do. i most defiantly did not foresee any of this EVER ending.",
      "i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll ever fully get into every aspect of how this came to be, but it should be said that, although this was not a mutual decision, i\u2019m realizing that, in the grand scheme of things, it might actually end up being the right one.",
      "i really don\u2019t want to be the goofed up person who says things like \u201cstay tuned\u201d and \u201cbig things coming soon\u201d bc we all know i just mean i\u2019m working on creating another type of the same thing, but more me. thats kind of how it goes. i want you all to know that i\u2019m staying at barstool and, when it comes to chit chatting on a weekly basis, i\u2019ll be right back.",
      "i\u2019m always transparent and honest with you and ... honestly i have a pit in my stomach as i post this but hey ... that\u2019s showbiz baby!",
      "i love and adore you guys. see you soon xoxo",
      "Though she said in that statement on Dec. 6 that she was staying at Barstool, she then shared Dec. 16 on her Instagram story that she was parting with Barstool.",
      "\u201cI wanted you guys to hear it from me first that this is my last day at Barstool,\u201d she wrote in the post. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everyone at the company and to Dave for taking a chance on me. I\u2019m just as surprised as you are there are no typos in this statement.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 19, O\u2019Malley and the Unwell Network \u2014 home to Cooper\u2019s \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d Alix Earle\u2019s \u201cHot Mess\u201d and other podcasts \u2014 shared in a joint post on Instagram that she is joining Unwell in some capacity.

      "Premature babies are among those at risk of dying if one of the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza follows Israeli orders to evacuate, the facility\u2019s director warned Monday.",
      "But even staying put poses a risk to 400 people, including patients, medics and sheltering civilians, who are in Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to its director, Dr. Husam Abu Safiya.",
      "Abu Safiya said that, over the weekend, tanks and bulldozers encircled the hospital\u2019s western gates, with heavy gunfire continuously aimed at the facility in Beit Latiya.",
      "\u201cBullets had penetrated the intensive care unit, the maternity department and the specialized surgery department,\u201d he said in a statement issued via WhatsApp.",
      "On Telegram, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry also stated that the hospital was being attacked with explosives.",
      "There are 91 patients hospitalized, including women in the neonatal unit of the hospital, according to Abu Safiya.",
      "\u201cAll types of weapons, including sniper fire, tank shells and quadcopters\u201d have been used to target the hospital\u2019s nursery, maternity ward and various other departments, he added.",
      "By then, \u201cthankfully,\u201d patients had been moved to the hospital\u2019s internal corridors, Abu Safiya said.",
      "The Israeli military declined to respond on the record to Abu Safiya\u2019s allegations, but on Friday it told Reuters it had sent food and fuel to the hospital and helped evacuate \"more than 100 patients\" and others.",
      "In October, Israeli forces stormed and then withdrew from Kamal Adwan Hospital, leaving a trail of destruction after a dayslong siege and overnight airstrikes that killed dozens. The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, labeled the offensive one of the \u201cdarkest moments\u201d in the conflict.",
      "Since October, Israel has renewed its military campaign in northern Gaza, predominantly in the areas of Beit Latiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, describing its efforts as a way to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping.",
      "Abu Safiya told Reuters in a text message on Sunday that shutting down the hospital would be \u201cnext to impossible,\u201d as there are not enough ambulances to get patients out. \u201cWe cannot evacuate these patients safely without assistance, equipment and time,\u201d he said.",
      "Aid agencies warn that the Israeli military\u2019s latest order risks the lives of patients, amid an apparent increase on attacks on civilians.",
      "\u201cThe Israeli Military\u2019s decision to resume attacks on an already damaged and under siege hospital whilst 400 civilians remain trapped inside, including babies in neonatal care, is a further violation of international law,\u201d said Mahmoud Shalabi, Medical Aid for Palestinians\u2019 deputy director in northern Gaza.",
      "\u201cAnnouncing a forced evacuation order whilst refusing aid in or patients and staff out leaves little option to obey, even if patients could be safely moved,\u201d he added.",
      "Phillipe Lazzarani, the head of the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, wrote in a post on X: \u201cMore civilians are reported killed and injured. Attacks on schools and hospitals have been commonplace.\u201d",
      "According to UNICEF estimates, at least 4,000 babies in the Gaza Strip have been completely cut off from newborn care in the past year due to sustained attacks on hospitals, especially deadly in the north.",
      "The war that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 and saw 250 taken hostage has decimated Gaza. Israeli forces have since killed some 45,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave\u2019s health system.",
      "Amid the collapse of the health care system, Kamal Adwan Hospital has become a critical provider of essential services for pregnant women and children in northern Gaza.",
      "Before the war, eight neonatal intensive care units were in operation across the Gaza Strip. By November this year, three of those units had been completely destroyed in the north, with the number of incubators plummeting from 105 to just nine \u2014 all at Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to UNICEF.",
      "\u201cAfter the heavy attacks sustained by the hospital, it is unclear if the [incubators] remain functional,\u201d said Adele Khodr, UNICEF\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director.",
      "She added, \u201cAny newborn baby fighting to sustain its breaths from inside a hospital incubator is entirely defenseless and entirely reliant on specialist medical care and equipment to survive.\u201d",
      "Doctors have floated that the Indonesian Hospital, located just outside the Jabaliya refugee camp, could serve as an alternative for transferring patients from Kamal Adwan. But they added that transporting patients and providing the necessary resources there would prove difficult.",
      "\u201cThe Indonesian Hospital has nonoperational generators, and there is also an oxygen station that is not functioning,\u201d Abu Safiya said.",
      "Over the past several months, doctors and aid workers at Kamal Adwan Hospital have repeatedly issued appeals for immediate action to safeguard Gaza\u2019s health care system.",
      "\u201cWe have urgently called on the world to intervene and protect the health care system, and we continue to plead for immediate action to safeguard it from this ongoing attack,\u201d Abu Safiya said in his latest statement."

      "Greenland, between the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean, is technically part of North America and is the largest island in the world. While a majority of Greenland is covered in ice, about 57,000 people live there.",
      "The U.S. has considered purchasing Greenland at least twice, including in 1867 and then in 1946, when President Harry S. Truman proposed buying it for $100 million. Denmark rejected the offer."

      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",

      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",

I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",

      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way.",

      "Several feminists wondered whether France is in a second wave of the #MeToo movement, which rippled through the film industry here after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s takedown in 2017 but failed to land the same punch on a broader spectrum as in the United States and other countries. France has a history of defending bold-faced men who act badly, such as exiled film director Roman Polanski. Famous French women like the actress Catherine Deneuve didn\u2019t help the cause by signing a letter that denounced sexual \u201cpuritanism\u201d and defended\u00a0men\u2019s \u201cfreedom to pester\u201d women.",
      "But women say the climate feels different this time. Last week, in another closely watched trial seen as France\u2019s first major #MeToo case, Christophe Ruggia, a little-known film director, was charged with isolating and repeatedly sexually assaulting rising star Ad\u00e8le Haenel, beginning when she was 12 and he was 36.  Haenel, now 35, eventually left the industry and denounced adults who failed to help her. He denies the charges; a verdict is expected in February.",
      "With tempers running high over the Pelicot case, activists are hoping to mobilize that outrage into an effort not only to help victims of sexual assault, but also to transform a society in which 75% of women say they are not treated equally, according to a 2024 government study.",
      "\u201cIn France, we haven\u2019t paid much attention to sexual violence,\u201d said Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host who started the organization Femmes Avec to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault navigate the justice system.",
      "Last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the population of Lille,\u201d R\u00e9us noted, citing the city on the northern border with Belgium.",
      "Much of the discussion has focused on the wording of France\u2019s rape law, which some feminist lawyers say is vague, particularly in cases in which a victim is intoxicated or, like Pelicot, subjected to being drugged,\u00a0known as \u201cchemical submission.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted crushing large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into his wife\u2019s food and drink. She would discover the truth only in November 2020, weeks after police arrested her husband after he was caught recording up the skirts of women in a supermarket.",
      "Rape is defined under French law as an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d committed \u201cby violence, coercion, threat or surprise.\u201d Defense lawyers have insisted that their clients did not intend to commit rape because Dominique Pelicot invited them into the family home, and gave them careful instructions on what he wanted them to do to his wife.",
      "\u201cThis is not American law. In France, you don\u2019t need to have obtained the victim\u2019s consent necessarily to ensure that it\u2019s not rape,\u201d said lawyer Guillaume de Palma, who represents several of the defendants.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d",
      "She said most European countries have adapted their laws and procedures to streamline rape investigations and help victims.",
      "Lafourcade, a veteran magistrate with experience investigating sexual assault cases, was among 500 activists who signed an open letter calling for a consent provision to be added to the law.",
      "But other activists and lawyers say the law is sufficient, with consent implied. Anything more explicit, they say, would force the victim to prove a lack of consent.",
      "Opposing camps do agree on one point: France must overhaul a system that makes it difficult to report sexual violence. From making a police report to following up with a timely medical exam, they agree that it is often a luck of the draw whether a police officer will follow proper procedure or a hospital or an emergency room nurse will agree to take essential DNA samples.",
      "Aurore Hendrickx, 26, a Paris event planner, said she has a few friends who have been sexually assaulted and tried without success to file reports with the police.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, they were almost laughing at them,\u201d she said of the police response, adding that a stunning 90% of her friends have been sexually assaulted or raped. One friend was almost killed by a violent partner.",
      "If police give victims the brush-off, it is often no better at hospitals, where traumatized women are often turned away, advocates say.",
      "Filmmaker Linda Bendali, who has researched cases of chemical submission \u2014 sometimes called date rape \u2014 said a friend\u2019s 23-year-old daughter woke up naked in a strange man\u2019s bed last March with no idea how she got there. Her last memory was sipping a drink in a Paris bar.",
      "\u201cI called the hospital and told them they could see her now. They said, \u2018No, come back tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bendali said, fuming, adding that she \u201cpushed hard\u201d to demand they take timely blood and hair samples, essential to prove whether the victim had ingested drugs.",
      "While the victim is awaiting a court date, that is a rare occurrence. Only 6% of rape complaints are investigated in France. After that, a trial is conducted behind closed doors \u2014 a process that feminist historian Christelle Taraud called \u201ctruly horrible for the victim,\u201d who is often treated badly by the defense lawyers, with no public accountability.",
      "Taraud called it an \u201celectric shock\u201d when a judge reluctantly approved Pelicot\u2019s demand to keep her trial open, even when intimate videos of her were aired. Finally, Taraud said, the public got to hear and see evidence of the horrific violence inflicted on Pelicot, whose show of strength has made her an international icon.",
      "\u201cThey treated her like a piece of meat,\u201d Taraud said.",
      "In testimony that left many spectators speechless, some of the men appeared to be acting out porn film fantasies. One of them, a former firefighter busted with thousands of images of child pornography, gave a thumbs up to the camera during the assault.",
      "The defendants, who met Dominique Pelicot in a now-defunct online chat room called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d told the five-judge panel that they believed the prone woman was a willing participant. Though her lolling head would seem to indicate otherwise, they called the petite woman, often dressed in lingerie, a swinger acting out a \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d fantasy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Dominique Pelicot said at the start of the trial. Slumped in a glass box, he was separated from the other defendants.",
      "Dominique Pelicot\u2019s cache of 20,000 photos and videos included snaps of his daughter, Caroline Darian, naked in bed. While he has insisted that he did not abuse her, Darian, whose book, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again,\u201d will be published in English next month, told the court that she\u2019ll never know what really happened. \u201cDid he also drug me?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWorse still, did he abuse me?\u201d",
      "In her final statement to the court, Pelicot made it clear that she is hoping her humiliation won\u2019t be in vain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes,\u201d she said.",
      "The \u201cGis\u00e8le effect\u201d extends beyond Avignon, where the retired logistics manager is applauded and handed bouquets of flowers. Schoolgirls call her name. Strangers send gifts. In a phenomenon that must be deeply satisfying to the woman who wanted \u201cshame to change sides,\u201d activists say women who hadn\u2019t dared speak about domestic violence and sexual assault credit Pelicot with giving them courage to share their stories.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally because of Gis\u00e8le that I have the strength to talk about it,\u201d said Latika, 33, who is still recovering from trauma four years after divorcing a violent husband.",
      "The beatings she said she endured were only part of the story. Latika said she learned the man she met at age 17, the father of her children, had been feeding her drugs for years. Like Pelicot, there were signs something was off, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cOne night I didn\u2019t drink all of my tea,\u201d she said, and she awoke to find her husband raping her.",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate her allegations.",
      "Latika has found solace as part of an \u201cequine therapy\u201d program at Lucky Horse, a 25-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of Mount Ventoux in the picture-postcard village of Mazan, about a mile from the former Pelicot home.",
      "Marion Vogel opened the ranch with her husband, a psychotherapist who has worked with domestic violence survivors, to help women develop \u201clife skills\u201d by working with animals. They ride horses without saddles and stirrups \u201cto connect body to body.\u201d They learn to trust themselves.",
      "First up for Latika was overcoming her fear of horses. She spent half a year building up her confidence tending to an adorable Shetland pony before graduating up to Z\u00e9phyr, a sleek champagne quarter horse with a white slash between his eyes who is now her favorite.",
      "She brushes Z\u00e9phyr\u2019s silky mane and takes him for rides in the same lanes and fields where, Vogel noted, Pelicot used to take long walks.",
      "Like Pelicot, Vogel said, these women \u201call have something to fight for.\u201d"

      "The annual drawing for \"El Gordo\" took place Sunday at Teatro Real, the country's pre-eminent opera house, in the capital, Madrid.",
      "Unlike many lotteries, it has no single jackpot, and the winnings are distributed among thousands of people in a complex system. Across the country, families, colleagues and friends often participate by pooling their money to buy tickets.",
      "Multiple tickets with the same number can be sold, and shops usually sell only one or two numbers, meaning those who win the largest prizes often live in the same area.",
      "El Gordo, which is held annually on Dec. 22, is a key part of the Christmas season in Spain, offering one of the largest lottery prize pools in the world. Organized by the Spanish government, it originated in 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the drawing is watched live on national television and livestreamed globally.",
      "On Sunday, the top prize of 400,000 euros ($416,588) was won by several ticket holders with the number 72480 bought in the northern city of Logro\u00f1o, the capital of the La Rioja region, according to El Gordo's official website.",

      "Students ages 8 to 14 from San Ildefonso, a primary school that dates back more than 500 years, revealed the winners by singing the numbers and the corresponding prize amounts, which are drawn from wooden balls.",
      "Tickets are printed and sold in series, meaning players buy printed tickets with numbers they did not personally choose.",
      "The number of series changes each year, and this year, each number had 193 copies, meaning many people shared the same winning ticket number, according to the official website.",
      "Most of the winners were from Spain\u2019s capital, Madrid, according to the Gordo website.",
      "Players can choose to buy two types of tickets: either a full ticket, called a billete, which costs \u20ac200 ($208), or a d\u00e9cimo, costing \u20ac20 (nearly $21), which is a tenth the size.",
      "It is common for groups of people to divide the cost of billetes to play as part of syndicates because of the high cost, according to the Gordo website."

      "SYDNEY \u2014 Australia on Monday approved a United States extradition request for former U.S. Marine pilot Daniel Duggan, who faces charges including breaking U.S. arms control law by training Chinese military pilots to land on aircraft carriers.",
      "Duggan, 55, a naturalized Australian citizen, was arrested by Australian Federal Police in a rural town in New South Wales state in October 2022, shortly after returning from China, where he had lived since 2014.",
      "Duggan\u2019s lawyers have argued in court there is no evidence the Chinese pilots he trained were military, and he was no longer a U.S. citizen at the time of the alleged offences. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2016 at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, backdated to 2012 on a certificate, they said.",
      "Australia\u2019s Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said he had determined Duggan should be extradited to the United States to face prosecution, after a New South Wales magistrate in May found him eligible for surrender.",

      "An indictment unsealed by the District of Columbia court showed Duggan faces four charges, and alleges he traveled between Australia, the U.S., China and South Africa between 2009 and 2012, when he was contracted by a Chinese national to provide services to a Chinese state-owned company, including evaluations of Chinese military pilot trainees and instruction on landing on aircraft carriers.",

      "What began as a tech mogul railing against political correctness in the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments on both sides of the Atlantic to reckon with Musk\u2019s growing political and cultural influence.",

      "His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire\u2019s politics.",
      "Musk\u2019s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d amplified calls for a general election just months after Starmer became prime minister, and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist.",
      "Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe, Musk last week openly endorsed Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "The AfD\u2019s leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully\u00a0employing Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings.",
      "Musk\u2019s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany\u2019s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD.",
      "In September, Musk praised Italy\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a black-tie event in New York, calling her a \u201cprecious genius\u201d and \u201ceven more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, behind the scenes,\u00a0he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications.",
      "Musk met directly with Xi at a 2023 dinner in San Francisco. His Tesla electric vehicles are largely\u00a0manufactured in China, including at its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d",
      "And in the U.S., Musk has already shown signs of his power over the political process, pushing the country\u2019s government to the brink of a shutdown after joining with Trump to effectively kill a congressional spending bill.",
      "While Musk\u2019s outsize role showed what he can achieve in Washington, his capacity to wield political influence may begin to stretch beyond U.S. borders."

      "Musk\u2019s proximity to the incoming president has given him invaluable access to heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron at the ceremonial reopening of Notre Dame and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in New York, referring to her as a \u201cprecious genius\u201d and \u201ceven more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside\u201d in introductory remarks at a black-tie gathering.",
      "More notably, Musk joined Trump\u2019s pivotal first call after the election with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions with world leaders alongside Trump are raising questions about the tech leader\u2019s potential influence on U.S. foreign policy over the next four years and the potential for conflicts of interest, Washington insiders say. Musk maintains extensive worldwide investments, especially in China, America\u2019s most powerful adversary, and has openly supported far-right political movements around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on a level that is so foreign to me I can\u2019t get my head around it,\u201d a former national security official in President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet said. \u201cBeing in these meetings alone or with Trump, who knows what ethics violations are taking place.\u201d",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said \u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency. The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "Musk holds over $15 billion in federal contracts \u2014 principally through his SpaceX rocket company that NASA has come to rely on for aspects of its rocket program. The Pentagon depends on Musk for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite services, which are critical for U.S. military operations around the world.",
      "Behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Since 2014, Trump has traveled to China at least eight times where he had meetings with senior Chinese officials. In one meeting, he was even offered a Chinese green card by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk met directly with Xi at an exclusive 2023 dinner in San Francisco when he visited the U.S. for a daylong summit in 2023.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla electric vehicles, which account for almost 50% of all EV sales in the U.S., are largely manufactured in China, where the company opened its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d Especially troubling to some is Musk\u2019s prospective role recommending ambitious cuts in federal jobs. The former intelligence official added, \u201cWhen he\u2019s one of the arbiters of government efficiency, and how many thousands of people he can fire, he has all these government conflicts.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s government contracts involve more than 17 U.S. government agencies. This week, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is looking into whether Musk complied with disclosure rules for his top-secret security clearance requiring him to report meetings with foreign officials, citing unnamed sources.",
      "\u201cI think he has incredible conflicts,\u201d the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, told NBC News, adding, \u201cHis association with the president-elect has already profited him as far as his personal assets are concerned.\u201d",
      "When asked if he thinks Musk\u2019s meetings with foreign leaders create problems because of his businesses in China and other countries, Cardin said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a transactional person who\u2019s going into a country to see if he can make a deal.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about Musk\u2019s influence in shaping Trump\u2019s foreign policy, told NBC News: \u201cWe have one president at a time. That president is President Biden.\u201d",
      "Clearly eager to smooth over any friction in the transition, Blinken quickly added praise for his likely successor, veteran Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, whom Trump has announced as incoming national security adviser.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in close communication with the incoming administration,\u201d Blinken said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural on one level for them to have conversations, communications, and in some ways, it\u2019s helpful to us, because we want to make sure that, as I said, we are handing over the baton in a way that the next administration can come in and be running at full speed.\u201d",
      "He did not directly answer the question about Musk\u2019s unofficial role.",
      "Musk has previously expressed an interest in affecting the trajectory of foreign affairs, which could further affect his dealings with world leaders.",
      "For months, Musk has clashed with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling Britain a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d endorsing calls for a new election and boosting a video from a jailed far-right activist. In August, Musk stoked tensions there by saying the country was on the verge of civil war following days of far-right violence.",
      "Musk has supported far-right movements around the world, including in Italy and most recently in Germany, where on Friday he expressed support for the country\u2019s AfD party, saying it could \u201csave Germany.\u201d",
      "In the last several days, consternation and excitement around Musk\u2019s potential influence under Trump reached a fever pitch after Musk initiated a movement that quickly torpedoed funding legislation supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "As some Republicans have celebrated Musk\u2019s successful effort to intervene, suggesting he should be made speaker of the House, many critics have raised concerns that Musk could be acting as a sort of \u201cshadow president\u201d or \u201cco-president\u201d to Trump."
