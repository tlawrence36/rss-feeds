      "Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, announced Tuesday that \u201cWhere We Keep the Light: From a Life of Service,\u201d will be released Jan. 27. Shapiro, 52, has become a prominent national Democrat since he was elected governor in 2022. He was on Kamala Harris' shortlist as a running mate in last year's presidential election and he has often been cited as a potential candidate for 2028.",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "The inventive R&B artist Ty Dolla $ign released his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt's \u2018Tycoon\u2019 season,'\u201d a beaming Ty Dolla $ign, declares.",
      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024. They debuted at No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard 200, respectively.",
      "\u201cTycoon\u201d is classic Ty Dolla $ign. The album is what he's made a name for himself doing: a collection of ceaselessly catchy, NSFW R&B anthems about lust and love (both mostly lechery), stacked with A-list collaborations: Quavo,Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Travis Scott, Chlo\u00eb \u2014 the list goes on.",
      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "\u201cCinema consumed him at such an early age and it never left him,\u201d DiCaprio says in the film. \u201cThere will never be anyone like him again,\u201d says Steven Spielberg.",
      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated for over 30 years, but their latest film, \"Blue Moon,\" pushed their partnership to new limits",
      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time. This film is about that breakup.",

Hart, meanwhile, would die eight months after the \u201cOklahoma!\u201d opening, at age 48.",
      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",

And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "More women are defying traditional beauty standards and finding empowerment by going without hair on their heads",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Many women are confronted with how they define beauty when they lose hair due to health conditions such as alopecia or during chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Felicia Flores, a flight attendant who lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed in 2001 with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Six years later, all her hair was gone. Initially, she wore wigs.",
      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",
      "To help uplift and inspire other women, Flores founded an annual conference called Baldie Con. The fourth one drew drew more than 200 attendees to Atlanta last month for a fashion show, guest speakers, a jazz brunch and a black tie gala, she said.",
      "Aicha Soumaoro, who works in Philadelphia as a nurse on weekdays and as a mechanic on weekends, said some of her patients call her \u201csir\u201d instead of \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t let it bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s new to them, girls that are bald.\u201d",
      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",
      "After her mother died, Thomas continued receiving compliments from other women. She decided to keep the bald look.",
      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "The protest descended into clashes with police who attempted to disperse protesters trying to reach the plant in an industrial complex, which is a designated military zone. Gabes, home to more than 400,000 residents, lies at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s phosphate industry, one of the key sources of export revenue for the North African country.",

      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes.

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",

      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",

      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",

      "UNAIDS\u2019 main goal is to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. Lesotho had made enough progress in reducing new infections and deaths to be on track, according to Pepukai Chikukwa, UNAIDS\u2019s country director in Lesotho.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

      "But it\u2019s not clear how much the U.S. bridge programs will \u201cclose the gap,\u201d added Chikukwa, even as she\u2019s leaving Lesotho. Her role was eliminated because of the aid cuts. The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",
      "Lesotho funded only 12% of its own health budget. The U.S. and other foreign donors provided the rest. USAID alone accounted for 34% of the budget; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26%, according to a May presentation to lawmakers.",
      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",

      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",

      "In the 16 years her organization has worked in Lesotho, HIV transmission from mother to child dropped to about 6% from nearly 18%. Lesotho\u2019s government should get credit, Connor said, but her group and others were key in targeting children\u2019s treatment and prevention.",
      "Since 2008, Connor\u2019s group received more than $227 million from the U.S. for Lesotho programming, USASpending.gov data shows. This fiscal year, about half the work it planned has been terminated.",

As of late August, half of PEPFAR funding targeted toward children in Lesotho was terminated, and 54% of infants tested for HIV before their first birthday in fiscal year 2024 were evaluated by programs that had been cut, according to Foundation for AIDS Research data.",

      "Japan's parliament elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the country\u2019s first female prime minister Tuesday",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japan's parliament elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the country\u2019s first female prime minister Tuesday, a day after her struggling party struck a coalition deal with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.",
      "Takaichi replaces Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the Liberal Democratic Party's disastrous election loss in July.",
      "Ishiba, who lasted only one year as prime minister, resigned with his Cabinet earlier in the day, paving the way for his successor.",
      "Takaichi won 237 votes \u2014 four more than a majority \u2014 compared to 149 won by Yoshikoko Noda, head of the largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in the lower house, which elects the prime minister. Even though her coalition was two seats short of a majority, Takaichi received enough votes to win in the first round. She likely received votes from lawmakers in fringe minority parties from whom she has sought cooperation.",
      "As the results were announced, Takaichi stood up and bowed deeply.",
      "Takaichi, 64, appointed former Defense Minister Minoru Kihara as chief cabinet secretary.",
      "Takaichi appointed her leadership rivals within the party to her government along with other veteran lawmakers. Toshimitsu Motegi, who previously served as both trade and foreign ministers, was named foreign minister. Former Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi was named defense minister. And former Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was named internal affairs and communication minister. She also appointed Ishiba's chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, as economy and trade minister.",
      "Despite her earlier pledge to drastically increase the number of women in the Cabinet, she appointed only three, all of them supporters in the party leadership vote \u2014 former Regional Revitalization Minister Satsuki Katayama as finance minister, Kimi Onoda as economic security minister and Midori Matsushima as the prime minister's aide.",
      "The LDP's alliance with the Osaka-based rightwing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, ensured her premiership because the opposition is not united. Takaichi's untested alliance is still short of a majority in both houses of parliament and will need to court other opposition groups to pass any legislation \u2014 a risk that could make her government unstable and short-lived.",
      "The two parties signed a coalition agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi\u2019s hawkish and nationalistic views.",
      "Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost its longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades.",

      "While she is the first woman serving as Japan's prime minister, she is in no rush to promote gender equality or diversity.",
      "Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women\u2019s advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family\u2019s male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage and allowing separate surnames for married couples.",
      "A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to emulate his policies including a stronger military and economy, as well as revising Japan's pacifist constitution. With her potentially weak grip on power, it\u2019s unknown how much Takaichi will be able to achieve.",
      "Also an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 and has served in a number of senior party and government posts, including as ministers of economic security and internal affairs, but her diplomatic background is thin.",
      "When Komeito left the governing coalition, it cited the LDP\u2019s lax response to slush fund scandals that led to their consecutive election defeats.",
      "The centrist party also raised concern about Takaichi\u2019s revisionist view of Japan's wartime past and her regular prayers at Yasukuni Shrine despite protests from Beijing and Seoul that see the visits as lack of remorse about Japanese aggression, as well as her recent xenophobic remarks.",
      "Takaichi has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament instead of going to Yasukuni.",

      "In the drying room, air is kept at 15 degrees Celsius (59 Fahrenheit) and 15% humidity for about three months, allowing the seeds to lose moisture slowly and evenly. Removing water extends their lifespan by slowing the natural processes that cause decay.",
      "Once dried, the seeds move to the cleaning room. There, technicians use sieves, brushes and a device called an aspirator that separates seeds from dust and debris with air pressure. The work is mostly manual and time consuming, said David Hickmott, Seed Curator at Kew, who oversees the process.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The Philippines has unveiled a new jail that may soon accommodate numerous powerful legislators, public works officials and others implicated in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects, a top official said Monday.",
      "The jail, which could hold up to 800 detainees in metropolitan Manila, was shown to the media by Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla in the latest bid by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s administration to quell public outrage over the scandal.",
      "The anomalies have linked dozens of Congress members, government engineers and construction company owners and sparked street protests in one of Asia\u2019s most flood-prone countries. Remulla estimated that about 200 officials and other suspects could be indicted by the Sandiganbayan, a special anti-graft court for government officials.",
      "That led to the decision to build a new jail to detain suspects who could be facing months or years of trial, he said.",
      "Remulla promised that the suspects, who may include former and incumbent members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, would not be given any VIP treatment, as has happened in the past with politicians convicted of crimes.",
      "\u201cWhat we are preparing are regular jail cells,\u201d Remulla said in a news conference. \u201cIf a shoplifter who stole a bottle of lotion worth 100 pesos ($1.7) from a shopping mall could be detained here, the ones who stole billions and billions in my view should be similarly locked up here.\u201d",
      "The jail comprises 80 cells, each capable of holding up to 10 inmates. Facilities include bunk beds, a shared bathroom, toilet, shower and purified drinking water. As in other detention centers, cellphones, computers and other communication gadgets are prohibited. Detainees will have access to their lawyers and an infirmary, he said.",

      "Marcos first raised alarm over the massive corruption involving flood control projects in his state of the nation speech before Congress in July. He later established an independent commission, which has been investigating potential irregularities, including in the 9,855 flood-control projects worth more than 545 billion pesos ($9.5 billion) that were supposed to have been undertaken since Marcos took office in mid-2022.",
      "Last month, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto told legislators that up to 118.5 billion pesos (more than $2 billion) worth of flood control projects may have been lost to corruption since 2023 alone.",
      "In televised congressional inquiries, construction company owners, government engineers and witnesses testified under oath that several legislators, including House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president\u2019s cousin and political ally, and Senate President Francis Escudero and four other incumbent and former senators were allegedly allotted huge kickbacks from flood control projects. Romualdez and Escudero have stepped down from their influential posts but have denied the allegations.",

      "Kot is among millions of Ukrainians who are bracing for another winter of power cuts and possibly blackouts as Russia renewed its campaign of attacks on the country\u2019s energy grid. Analysts and officials say that this year Moscow has shifted tactics, targeting specific regions and gas infrastructure.",
      "In some regions \u2014 mostly those closer to the front line in the east \u2014 the season of buzzing generators has started, as well as long hours of darkness with no power or water. People are once again pulling out small power stations, charging numerous power banks, and storing bottles of water in their bathrooms.",
      "The attacks have grown more effective as Russia launches hundreds of drones, some equipped with cameras that improve targeting, overwhelming air defenses \u2014 especially in regions where protection is weaker.",
      "The consequences are already reshaping daily life \u2014 especially for those whose survival depends on electricity. For Zinaida Kot, who has been on dialysis for seven years, this is far worse than mere discomfort.",
      "\u201cIt is bad. We really worry when there is no electricity,\u201d she said from her hospital bed, connected to a dialysis machine powered by a generator that staff call \u201cnot reliable enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no treatment, I would die. I would not exist.\u201d",
      "In early October, a Russian strike left the small northern town of Shostka \u2014 with a prewar population of nearly 72,000 \u2014 without electricity, water, or gas. The town lies just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front line in northern Sumy region. Gas service was later restored, and electricity returned for only a few hours each day.",
      "\u201cThe situation is challenging,\u201d said Mykola Noha, the mayor of Shostka. Electricity and water are now supplied on a schedule, available for a few hours each day. \u201cAnd it really worries the residents as we can\u2019t predict power cuts. We fix something and it gets destroyed again. This is our situation.\u201d",
      "Shostka hums with the low growl of generators on rain-dark asphalt, blanketed in yellow leaves. They power cafes, shops, residential buildings, and hospitals. Across town, so-called \u201cinvincibility points\u201d offer residents a place to charge devices, warm up, and even rest on cots provided.",
      "The hardest days, locals say, were when there was no gas \u2014 no heat or way to cook \u2014 and people made meals over open fires in the streets.",
      "At the local hospital, where all stoves are electric, staff built a simple wood-burning oven during the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion, in 2022, when the town came close to occupation. And now it helps to feed at least 180 patients, said Svitlana Zakotei, 57, a nurse who oversees the patients\u2019 meals.",
      "The hospital has spent three weeks running on generators \u2014 a costly lifeline that burns half a ton of fuel a day, about 250,000 hryvnias ($5,973) a week, said the hospital's chief, Oleh Shtohryn. That\u2019s nearly as much as its usual monthly electricity bill.",
      "Power is rationed. In the dialysis ward, lights stay dim so electricity can feed the machines that keep patients alive. One of the eight units burned out because of the blackout \u2014 a costly loss the hospital could not afford to replace soon. Still, 23 patients come daily for hourslong treatment.",
      "The crisis in Shostka reflects Russia\u2019s shifting strategy. In 2022\u20132023, Moscow launched waves of missiles and drones across the country to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s national grid. This year, it is striking region by region.",
      "The recent pattern shows heavier attacks on the Chernihiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, while Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Dnipro face less frequent but still regular strikes.",
      "On Tuesday, Chernihiv and part of the region were left without electricity after Russia attacked the local energy grid the night before, local officials said.",

      "Share prices have soared in Japan recently on hopes that conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Share prices have soared recently in Tokyo on hopes that conservative Japanese lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies, including hefty spending on defense and cheap credit.",
      "The benchmark Nikkei 225 share index climbed close to the symbolically important 50,000 level, gaining 0.7% to 49,517.57. Takaichi, a motorbike and heavy metal enthusiast, prevailed in a lower house parliamentary ballot that gave her 237 votes, above the 233 votes required to win.",
      "Here\u2019s what might be expected from what has been dubbed \u201cSanaenomics:\u201d",
      "Increases in consumer prices have surpassed the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target range at 2.5% to 3%. So the central bank is gradually raising rates from their longstanding level near or below zero. Wages remain near the level they were at 30 years ago, only topping the 1997 average level in 2024 for the first time. Meanwhile, low rates have helped to keep the Japanese yen weak against the dollar, amplifying inflation since much of what Japan consumes is imported.",
      "\u201cI want to focus first on dealing with rising consumer prices,\u201d Takaichi told reporters after she was elected head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this month, putting her in line to replace departing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Takaichi has indicated she opposes raising interest rates. The promise of continued cheap credit is one reason share prices have shot higher. But keeping rates low will hinder efforts to curb inflation and to strengthen the Japanese yen.",
      "Echoing many of her predecessors\u2019 promises, Takaichi also has vowed to deliver wage increases, without saying how she intends to do that.",
      "Japan\u2019s population has been shrinking and rapidly aging for years, leading to labor shortages and undermining the country\u2019s potential economic growth.",
      "Although she is an unabashed conservative on most social issues, Takaichi has said she favors giving tax incentives to companies that provide child care facilities to their employees and possible tax breaks for family spending on child care.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what more the government might do under any leader to counter the low birth rate, which partly reflects the financial difficulties of raising and educating children when wages fail to keep up with inflation. It also reflects a corporate culture that is not conducive to a family-friendly work-life balance.",
      "Takaichi is expected to emulate the policies of her late mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. His \u201cAbenomics\u201d approach included promises of cash handouts and boosting government spending, despite a national debt that is nearly triple the size of the economy.",

      "Takaichi is bound to seek cordial relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, just as Abe did, and to strengthen Japan\u2019s security alliance with Washington. They are expected to meet later this month.",
      "Initially Takaichi said Japan might want to rethink its pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration, part of a deal that helped lower U.S. tariffs on imports from Japan. She later said she would honor the agreement, despite public disapproval over handing over Japanese taxpayers\u2019 money to Washington.",
      "Takaichi will be confronting problems that have confounded Japan\u2019s leadership for decades. Any major reforms would face resistance from entrenched vested interests. The tenures of Japanese prime ministers tend to be short and vulnerable to feuding between party factions and the hereditary political fiefdoms that control most seats in parliament.",
      "To win Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary vote, the Liberal Democrats forged an alliance with the Japan Innovation Party, a libertarian opposition group based in Osaka.",
      "But Takaichi likely will need support from lawmakers belonging to other parties in the fractious and splintered opposition to pass legislation. They span the spectrum from the Japan Communist Party on the far left to the Sanseito and others on the extreme right.",
      "Takaya Suzuki, who runs a restaurant and real estate business, supports one of the smaller nationalist-leaning opposition parties called The Conservative Party of Japan, whose policies are similar to Takaichi\u2019s. He admires Trump and says he\u2019s rooting for Takaichi.",

      "President Donald Trump is preparing for a significant trip to Asia, aiming to address international trade tensions",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is expected to leave for Asia at the end of the week, betting that an around-the-world journey will help him untangle big issues that he can\u2019t afford to get wrong.",
      "At stake is nothing less than the future of the global economy, which could hinge on whether he\u2019s able to calm trade tensions during an expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A misstep could send shock waves through American industries that have already been rattled by Trump\u2019s aggressive tariffs, government layoffs and political brinkmanship.",
      "Trump\u2019s strategy of improvisation has had both hits and misses since he returned to office in January. Hamas returned hostages to Israel but the ceasefire in the Middle East remains fragile; a trade war with China has ebbed and flowed this year; and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine hasn\u2019t slowed down despite Trump\u2019s efforts to resolve the conflict.",
      "There's been some mystery around Trump's trip, with no official announcements from the White House about much of his itinerary. The president said Monday that he plans to go to Malaysia, which is hosting a regional summit, then Japan, where he's trying to nail down foreign investment.",
      "He'll also visit South Korea, where he's working on more trade issues and expects to sit down with Xi. Beijing has yet to confirm that they\u2019ll meet, and the two leaders have recently exchanged threats of tariffs and export restrictions.",
      "\"I have a very good relationship with President Xi of China,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. He offered to lower tariffs but \u201cthey have to give us some things too,\u201d including buying U.S. soybeans, reducing the flow of fentanyl ingredients and ending limits on rare earth minerals that are critical for high-tech manufacturing.",
      "Trump expressed even more confidence on Monday, saying, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China\" and \"it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "With just days to go before Trump leaves, there\u2019s an unusual level of ambiguity even for a president who loves to keep people guessing about his next move.",
      "\u201cThe whole trip has seemed so uncertain from the beginning,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, a managing director at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "It's Trump's first trip to Asia since returning to office. Although he\u2019s hosted leaders from the region at the White House, he hasn\u2019t forged the kind of foundational relationships that he has on other continents.",
      "Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the president, responded to a list of questions about Trump\u2019s plans by saying he \u201cwill participate in meetings and events in Asia that will result in many great deals for our country.\u201d She added, \u201cStay tuned!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Asia has focused on using tariffs to realign what he describes as unfair trade practices, unnerving countries that depend on the United States as the world\u2019s largest market for exports. There\u2019s also anxiety about Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi, and the potential that a feud between the two leaders could send the international economy into a tailspin.",
      "\u201cThere will be some appreciation for the fact that he\u2019s there, but I don\u2019t think it will go far enough to quell the doubts that are pervasive in the region,\u201d Glaser predicted.",
      "The Republican president has downsized his foreign policy team since his first term, eschewing the typical array of advisers at the National Security Council in favor of a core group of loyalists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not very many White House staff to do this kind of work,\u201d said Rush Doshi, who worked on China policy under President Joe Biden. \u201cAll of this puts us in uncharted waters.\u201d",
      "Michael Green, who worked on President George W. Bush's National Security Council and now leads the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, Australia, said there's been no clear Asia strategy from Trump.",
      "\u201cEveryone is waiting to see where he\u2019s going to come down on all of this,\" he said.",
      "Others say Trump's approach is paying off. Anthony Kim, a research fellow in international economic affairs at the Heritage Foundation, said Japan and South Korea are eager to work with the administration to solidify partnerships.",
      "The message from them has been \u201clet\u2019s sit down, talk about relevant details to make a deal,\u201d Kim said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. commands \u201cgreat respect\u201d from Beijing and that he will reach a \u201cfantastic deal\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet soon.",
      "Trump's remarks come after Beijing infuriated him by expanding export controls on rare earth products that are used in smartphones, fighter jets, electric vehicles and more. Trump spoke as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House, celebrating an agreement with the U.S. ally as a potential counterpoint to China's near-monopoly in processing those critical minerals.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s going to be a great trade deal. It\u2019s going to be fantastic for both countries, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "When asked about China's leverage, Trump said Beijing \u201cthreatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs.\" But he insisted his good relationship with Xi means they would work out \u201da very fair deal.\"",
      "All eyes are on a potential meeting between Trump and Xi because any failure to reach some agreement raises the risk of destabilizing not only relations between the two superpowers but also the global economy.",
      "Trump affirmed that he would meet with Xi this month on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, a grouping of 21 economies. Beijing has not announced plans for Xi to make the trip to South Korea, but it's not unusual for such details to emerge closer to the travel date.",
      "The president has threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on China in response to Beijing\u2019s expanded rules on rare earth products. And he said Monday that it has already had results.",
      "\u201cNow, they\u2019re treating us with great respect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see what happens. I said, if we don\u2019t make a deal, I\u2019m putting on an additional 100% on November 1. I think we\u2019ll make a deal.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has levied additional 30% across-the-board tariffs on China. Trump said the total rate on Chinese goods is about 55% to 57% and the country has paid the U.S. \u201chundreds of billions of dollars worth of money for tariffs.\u201d",
      "Beijing, however, has indicated it would play hardball.",
      "\u201cThreatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said last week in response to Trump's new tariffs threat.",

      "The United States is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan, which split from China in 1949 during a civil war.

      "Georgia Democrats are focusing on rising electricity bills in the statewide election of two utility regulators",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Democrats are seeking to make a statewide election of two utility regulators a referendum on rising electricity bills.",
      "Republicans, warning Democrats could steal rare wins in the races for the Public Service Commission, want to make the vote about party loyalty.",
      "Among Republicans trying to turn out voters before Nov. 4 are GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who is spending from his own war chest to try to get Republican incumbent Tim Echols reelected and to elect Fitz Johnson, a Republican who Kemp appointed. They're trying to fend off Democrats Peter Hubbard, a green energy advocate, and Alicia Johnson, a health care consultant. All five commission seats are currently held by Republicans.",
      "Supporters of the Democratic candidates are spending large sums on races that typically cost less than $500,000. Georgia Conservation Voters Action Fund said Friday that it would spend more than $2.2 million. Kemp won't say how much he's spending, but Echols said Kemp \u201cis very committed\" to Republican victory.",
      "\u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t know how important it is, and the Democrats want it to stay that way,\" Kemp said at an Oct. 7 rally in Cumming, a key GOP heartland north of Atlanta.",
      "Georgia isn't the only state where electricity prices are a political issue this year. They\u2019re being debated in governor\u2019s races in New Jersey and Virginia. Nationwide, electric prices for residential consumers went up 5.2% from July 2024 to July 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cAre you happy with your power, bill, and do you want it to continue to increase and look like a car payment or a mortgage?\u201d Hubbard says he asks voters. \u201cThat\u2019s a natural opener, because no one is happy with the direction of their power bills.\u201d",
      "Georgia Power bills have risen six times in recent years because of higher natural gas costs and construction projects, including two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta. A typical Georgia Power residential customer now pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.",
      "Republicans are touting a three-year freeze in base rates that they enacted in July, although bills could still rise next year to pay off nearly $1 billion in storm damage, mainly from 2024\u2019s Hurricane Helene. They\u2019re also trying to flip the cost argument on Democrats, claiming Democrats will try to shutter natural gas plants, drive up power bills with environmental mandates and force affluent consumers to subsidize poorer consumers.",
      "\u201cThis is the Green New Deal and it is crushing families around this country,\u201d Fitz Johnson said.",
      "Hubbard said Republican attacks claiming Democrats would raise bills are \u201cpatently not true.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s saying that. And furthermore, you\u2019ve just done that to the people of Georgia,\u201d Hubbard said, referring to bill increases approved by Echols and Fitz Johnson.",
      "Unusually, because of a voting rights lawsuit that delayed elections, Georgia's Public Service Commission races aren't overshadowed by governor or U.S. Senate contests. While Atlanta and other cities are having municipal elections, the commission races are the only statewide offices on the ballot for many voters.",
      "The commission regulates prices charged to 2.3 million customers by Georgia Power, the state's only privately owned electrical utility. It also regulates two private natural gas utilities.",

      "No Georgia Democrat has won a nonfederal statewide office since 2006.",

      "There are other issues at stake, especially with electricity demand projected to rise because of the growth in computer data centers. The commission passed rules it says will protect other ratepayers from shouldering the costs for data centers, but Democrats say those rules are too flimsy.",
      "The typical Georgia Power residential customer is paying more than $14 a month just for the new reactors at Vogtle, after Georgia Power and its co-owners spent $30.9 billion \u2014 coming in seven years late and $17 billion over budget.",
      "Both Echols and Fitz Johnson say they support additional nuclear reactors, with Echols telling The Associated Press on Monday that he would vote for more nuclear plants now if the federal government would provide protection against cost overruns. He added that nuclear is \u2018too risky\u2019 right now.\u201d",
      "Alicia Johnson and Hubbard emphasize solar and wind power, motivated by concerns about carbon emissions from natural gas plants that Georgia Power wants to build. The Democrats also support lowering how much Georgia Power can earn on the money it invests, the key driver of the company\u2019s profits.",
      "There are other signs of trouble for Republicans. Echols says city elections statewide are likely to bring out more Democrats than Republicans. Although still microscopic, Democratic turnout far outstripped Republican turnout in primaries over the summer, and Democrats may be more eager to vote because of discontent with President Donald Trump.",
      "But overall, the commission races remain obscure. Early voting started last week, and only 112,000 people have voted through Monday.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent\u2019s rich rare-earth resources at a time when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.",
      "The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.",
      "\u201cIn about a year from now we\u2019ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won\u2019t know what to do with them,\" said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. \"They\u2019ll be worth $2.\u201d",
      "Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \u201cto the next level.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.",
      "\u201cAustralia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we\u2019re seeing from the Chinese,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Albanese.",
      "Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.",
      "The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce its dominance.",
      "Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.",
      "For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.",
      "\"I think taking away that arrow in the quiver of China to manipulate pricing is an absolute crucial first step in Australia and the West being able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our supply chain demands,\u201d said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.",
      "The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China's influence.",
      "\u201cChina is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. \u201cThey are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That\u2019s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "But Althaus cautioned that Australia can\u2019t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.",

      "Takaichi, 64, is set to replace Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary vote. If she's successful, it would end Japan's three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the coalition's loss in the July parliamentary election.",
      "The moderate centrist Komeito party had split from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after a 26-year-long coalition. It came just days after Takaichi\u2019s election as LDP leader, and forced her into a desperate search for a new coalition partner to secure votes so that she can become prime minister.",
      "The Buddhist-backed Komeito left after raising concerns about Takaichi's ultraconservative politics and the LDP\u2019s lax response to corruption scandals that led to the party's consecutive election defeats and loss of majority in both houses.",
      "While the leaders of the country's top three opposition parties failed to unite to seek a change of government, Takaichi went for a quick fix by teaming up with the most conservative of them: the Osaka-based Ishin no Kai, or Japan Innovation Party. The two parties on Monday signed a coalition agreement that includes joint policy goals on diplomacy, security and energy.",
      "The fragile new coalition, still a minority in the legislature, would need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation.",
      "Big diplomatic tests await the government within days \u2014 talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional summits. At home, Takaichi needs to quickly tackle rising prices and come up with economic stimulus measures to appease the frustrated public.",
      "An admirer of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi's breaking of the glass ceiling makes history in a country whose gender equality ranks poorly internationally.",
      "But many women aren't celebrating, and some see her impending premiership as a setback.",
      "\u201cThe prospect of a first female prime minister doesn\u2019t make me happy,\u201d sociologist Chizuko Ueno posted on X. Ueno said that Takaichi\u2019s leadership would elevate Japan\u2019s gender equality ranking, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean Japanese politics becomes kinder to women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, an ultraconservative star of her male-dominated party, is among those who have stonewalled measures for women\u2019s advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family\u2019s male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the civil law allowing separate last names for married couples, so women don\u2019t get pressured into abandoning theirs.",
      "\u201cMs. Takaichi\u2019s policies are extremely hawkish and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,\u201d said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper.",

      "Vietnam is racing to electrify its motorbike market, one of the largest in Southeast Asia with 77 million bikes on the road",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Vietnam is split between two visions: the rumbling, reliable gas-powered motorbikes that now rule the roads, and sleek, silent electric bikes the government says are its future.",
      "Hanoi plans to ban fossil-fuel motorcycles from its city center in July 2026, part of a national drive to cut emissions and air pollution. Its commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is weighing a similar step. By 2030, Vietnam aims for a third of cars and more than a fifth of motorbikes to run on electricity.",
      "Some see this as an opportunity to swap out smoke-belching engines for cleaner, quieter rides, But others remain wary. Gas-powered bikes are still cheaper, sturdier, and easier to repair. Many owners worry that electric models could fall short on range, affordability, and charging convenience.",
      "At the heart of the debate is the motorbike\u2019s central place in Vietnamese life. The country\u2019s 77 million two-wheelers \u2014 including 7 million in Hanoi and 8.5 million in Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 power small businesses, shape daily commerce, and set the rhythm of cities. Shopkeepers pile goods onto scooters to push through traffic, while families squeeze three generations onto a single bike for the school run.",
      "While delivery drivers and mechanics are scrambling, electric bike start ups are opening new retail stores and e-bike sales are climbing.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s biggest motorbike makers, Honda and Yamaha, say the 2026 timeline is too ambitious. Vietnamese electric vehicle companies \u2014 start ups like Dat Bike or the larger VinFast, backed by Vietnam\u2019s largest conglomerate VinGroup \u2014 and the Chinese electric bikemaker Yadea are betting on an electric future.",
      "Ta Manh Cuong, 45, a ride-hailing driver who earns about $20 on good days, calls his battered but reliable motorbike his \u201ciron horse,\u201d a slang riders use for their faithful companion through the city\u2019s daily chaos. He'd be willing to shift to an electric bike, would even welcome it if it cost less.",
      "\u201cBut right now I can\u2019t afford to buy an electric bike,\u201d he said.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s motorbike market, at about 3.5 million units a year, is the second-largest in Southeast Asia. It's also among the most electrified markets for two-wheelers, ranking third only to China and India, though electric motorbikes make up about 12% of total sales.",
      "Electrifying remaining two-wheelers is key for cutting tailpipe emissions and clearing smog from the streets. EVs are more energy efficient than gas engines, said Zifei Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation. About 70,000 deaths in Vietnam each year are linked to polluted air, according to the Boston-based nonprofit Health Effects Institute.",
      "Unlike the car market, Yang added, motorbikes sold in Vietnam are made there. That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment. Vietnam\u2019s transition could also shape other developing markets.",
      "\u201cThese countries look at each other. Look at the experience,\u201d she said.",
      "Electric motorbike sales have surged since the ban was announced, with purchases of smaller bikes up 89% and full-sized bikes 197% in the first eight months of 2025. VinFast led as its sales more than quadrupled, outpacing Yadea and other local rivals, according to industry tracker MotorcyclesData.",
      "Yang said government subsidies to scrap old motorbikes could help riders like Cuong. While better public transport in crowded city centers would also encourage the shift to electric vehicles. She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel. Stations where riders can replace depleted batteries with a fully charged one instead of waiting for it to recharge would also help.",

      "Yang said smaller batteries make home charging easier, battery costs are falling globally, and EVs are no more fire-prone than older vehicles, though such fires need special training and strict safety standards.",
      "Ho Chi Minh City plans to replace 400,000 gasoline motorbikes with electric ones by 2028, starting with a 2026 ban on using gas bikes for ride-hailing and delivery. The city will offer low-interest loans, tax breaks and set up low-emission zones to curb pollution. In Hanoi, people affected by the ban can get $120\u2013$200 in subsidies to buy electric bikes worth at least $590, depending on income, and won\u2019t have to pay new registration or license plate fees until 2030.",
      "VinFast looks set to profit from the transition. Its ride-hailing company, Green SM, surpassed Singapore-based regional ride-hailing firm Grab in February to become the market leader in Vietnam. It soon will launch its first battery\u2011swapping electric motorbike, selling for about $760. It plans, also, to build 150,000 battery-swapping stations nationwide within three years.",
      "VinFast is partnering with Vietnamese banks to offer low\u2011interest loans and subsidies to boost electric vehicle adoption, including covering up to 90% of costs and waiving registration fees.",
      "These policies and incentives can encourage more purchases of electric motorbikes, said Dat Bike CEO and founder Son Nguyen, but long-term success hinges on making electric bikes that deliver high performance, long ranges and fast charging at prices equal to or better than gas-guzzling motorbikes. \u201cIncentives can help add momentum, but long-term success depends on building products that win on their own merits,\u201d he said.",
      "Dat Bike raised $22 million in September from private investors, nearly doubling its capital to $47 million. The company said it will use the funding to boost production, research and expand its sales.",
      "Honda dominates Vietnam\u2019s motorcycle market with a more than 80% market share. It sold about 2.3 million bikes in Vietnam from April 2024 to March 2025 and exported 300,000 more, cementing the country as both a top market and a key production hub.",
      "Yamaha trails with about a 17% share. Through Vietnam\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 association, the two companies said the 2026 ban is too rushed. Honda only began selling e-bikes this year and warned that replacing millions of bikes quickly would strain consumers.",
      "Honda and the Vietnam's motorcycle manufacturers' association didn't respond to requests for comment. Yamaha told The Associated Press that it was reviewing the plan and couldn't respond yet.",
      "For now, many businesses are hedging their bets. Bao Ngoc Cao, who rents motorbikes to expats and tourists, said she was \u201cterrified\u201d when she first heard about the ban. Her business runs on the principle that bikes are cheap \u2014 costing about $80 monthly. Losing access to Hanoi\u2019s most touristy streets would cut her off from her core customers, and while interest in EVs is growing, current subsidies aren\u2019t nearly enough for her to replace her fleet. Still, she says she supports the ban in principle, welcoming the promise of cleaner air and healthier streets.",
      "\u201cWe are just waiting to get more clarity and see what happens,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.",
      "In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.",
      "That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. \u201cThis rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.",
      "It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\u201cChina is learning from the best,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \u201cBeijing is copying Washington\u2019s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.\"",
      "He added: \u201cGame recognizes game.\"",
      "It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.",
      "Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's \u201centity list\u201d that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.",
      "In 2021, Beijing adopted the anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies such as the Chinese Foreign Ministry to deny visas and freeze the assets of unwelcome individuals and businesses \u2014 similar to what the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Treasury can do.",
      "Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be \u201chitting back with the enemy's methods.\u201d",
      "The law \u201chas combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,\u201d said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report. He also said it could deter the other side from escalating.",

      "Other formal measures Beijing has adopted in the past several years include expanded export controls and foreign investment review tools.",
      "Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often \u201cvery parallel\u201d to those of the U.S., he said.",
      "Both governments also have adopted a \u201cholistic view of national security,\u201d which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.",
      "When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.",
      "In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.",
      "That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.",
      "In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "Then came the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.",
      "While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.",
      "\u201cThe dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,\u201d he said. And second, \"in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.\u201d",

      "The Boeing 747, flown by Turkey-based ACT Airlines, was landing at Hong Kong International Airport around 3:50 a.m. from Dubai. The aircraft was being operated under lease by Emirates, a long-haul carrier based in Dubai.",
      "The pilots did not seek help before landing and had taxied about halfway down the runway before skidding off to the left, Steven Yiu, the airport authority\u2019s executive director in airport operations, told a news conference.",
      "\u201cThe patrol car absolutely did not rush onto the runway. It was the plane that went off the runway and crashed into the patrol car outside the fence,\u201d he said.",
      "When rescue crews arrived, the plane was broken into two parts, floating in the sea, and the four crew members were waiting to be rescued at its open door, said Yiu Men-yeung, a fire services official.",
      "Rescuers dove into the sea and found the two security workers trapped in the car after a 40-minute search, Yiu Men-yeung said.",
      "TV images showed the aircraft partially submerged just off the edge of the airport\u2019s sea wall. Its front half and cockpit were visible above water but the tail end appearing to have broken off. Two boats, possibly with search and rescue personnel, were near the aircraft.",
      "The crash occurred on the north runway of Hong Kong\u2019s airport, one of Asia\u2019s busiest. That runway remained closed, while the two others continued to operate. Steven Yiu said flights would be unaffected.",
      "Weather was suitable at the time the plane landed and the cause of the crash was being investigated, he said.",
      "The Air Accident Investigation Authority classified the case as an accident, with the investigation looking into multiple factors, including the flight\u2019s system, operation and maintenance. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were being sought.",
      "Emirates said the Boeing 747 freighter was wet leased and operated by ACT Airlines. In wet leases, the company supplying the plane also provides the crew, maintenance and insurance. Emirates said there was no cargo on board. The aircraft was 32 years old, according to Flightradar24.",

      "Behind the scenes, the British government has been seeking to resolve the row, which comes at a time of heightened worries about antisemitism in Britain following a deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue earlier this month and calls from Palestinians and their supporters for a sports boycott of Israel over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Jaxon Smith-Njigba had his NFL-leading fifth 100-yard receiving game of the season as the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans 27-19",
      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Jaxon Smith-Njigba called it spontaneous. Sam Darnold was simply surprised.",
      "The reserved Smith-Njigba, who has let his play speak for itself while leading the NFL in yards receiving this season, decided to celebrate his fourth touchdown catch of the season in style.",
      "After corralling an 11-yard pass from Darnold in the end zone to give the Seattle Seahawks a 14-0 lead on the Houston Texans late in the first quarter , Smith-Njigba effortlessly and gracefully slam-dunked the football on the crossbar of the goalposts. He drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the process, but helped guide the Seahawks to a 27-19 win on Monday night.",
      "\u201cThat was very spontaneous,\u201d Smith-Njigba said. \u201cDefinitely saw a lot of my favorites do it (growing up), but that was really on the spot right there.\u201d",
      "Smith-Njigba caught eight passes for 123 yards receiving, good for his NFL-leading fifth 100-yard receiving game of the season. He became the second player in franchise history to record three straight 100-yard games, and his five 100-yard games this season are tied for the second-most in a year by any Seahawks player.",
      "As stellar as Smith-Njigba has been in his third NFL season, what he\u2019s put forth on the regular has become somewhat expected. From teammate and 2021 AP NFL Offensive Player of the year Cooper Kupp\u2019s perspective, though, Smith-Njigba\u2019s excellence should be appreciated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing routine about what he\u2019s been able to do productivity-wise,\u201d Kupp said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. That\u2019s difficult. Takes a lot of work to be able to do that. I think that\u2019s the standard.\u201d",
      "Outside of Smith-Njigba\u2019s success, the Seahawks didn\u2019t get a whole lot going offensively against the No. 1 rated scoring defense in the NFL. Seattle did strike first, though, when running back Zach Charbonnet plunged in from one yard out on the Seahawks\u2019 second drive of the game to give them a 7-0 lead.",
      "They had excellent field position thanks to linebacker Uchenna Nwosu sacking C.J. Stroud for an 18-yard loss, which pinned the Texans at their own one-yard line. It was the third-longest sack in Seahawks franchise history by Nwosu, who missed Seattle\u2019s first game of the season and was limited due to injuries in 2023 and 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see him play like this right now,\u201d defensive end Leonard Williams III said of Nwosu.",
      "Charbonnet punched in his second touchdown of the game, a two-yard rush, late in the third quarter to give the Seahawks a 27-12 advantage.",
      "Houston, meanwhile, scored its first touchdown of the game when Darnold was strip-sacked in his own end zone midway through the third quarter. Texans edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. recovered the fumble in the Seahawks\u2019 end zone, but Houston failed to convert its two-point conversion attempt.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Darnold said, \u201cI got to get the ball out of my hands.\u201d",
      "The Texans\u2019 only offensive touchdown came courtesy of a four-yard TD pass from Stroud to running back Woody Marks with only 2:04 remaining in regulation.",
      "\u201cOur defense kept us in the whole game,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cGot to help those guys out and score some points somehow, some way.\u201d",
      "Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn added two field goals for the Texans, whose two-game win streak was snapped and dropped to 2-4 on the year. Jason Myers, meanwhile, converted two of three attempts for the Seahawks, who advanced to 5-2 on the season and moved into a tie atop the NFC West with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams heading into their bye week",
      "\u201cI think we got our bye at the perfect time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost midseason right now. I think we\u2019re going into it feeling good about what we\u2019ve accomplished so far.\u201d",
      "Linebacker Ernest Jones IV set a career-high with his third interception of the season, picking off Stroud on the Texans\u2019 first drive of the third quarter. Jones dropped into coverage and slid in front of a pass intended for Houston\u2019s leading receiver, Nico Collins, and returned it 28 yards.",

      "Last year, Stroud was sacked 52 times in 17 games. Despite the improvement, right tackle Tytus Howard recognized Monday\u2019s showing was a step back for the Texans. Houston coach DeMeco Ryans added that Houston\u2019s offensive line was sloppy in defeat.",

      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",

      "DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. Users reported trouble with the social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games, the online broker Robinhood and the McDonald\u2019s app, as well as Netflix, Disney+ and many other services.",
      "The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Signal chat app both said on X that they were experiencing trouble related to the outage.",

His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

      "The country\u2019s largest teachers unions are teaming up with tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI to help educators build literacy in artificial intelligence",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "Both hail from the outer edges of our solar system \u2014 possibly what's known as the Oort Cloud, well beyond Pluto. Comet Lemmon will have its closest brush with Earth on or around Tuesday. The other cosmic snowball, Comet SWAN, should have its flyby with Earth on Monday, but it's headed away from the sun and will likely grow dimmer as the days pass.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",

      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cIn my case, it\u2019s outrage over abuse of power, corruption, the deaths,\u201d Tafur said, referring to the sharp rise in murders and extortion plaguing the South American country since 2017, amid new laws that have weakened efforts to fight crime.",
      "Boluarte had been under investigation for months over various allegations including bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. She was replaced last week by interim President Jos\u00e9 Jer\u00ed.",
      "Tafur said that wasn\u2019t enough.",
      "\u201cThe president is an ally of Congress and has to go,\u201d he said.",
      "Many significant protests in the past, like Occupy Wall Street in 2011, the Arab Spring between 2010 and 2012, and the 2014 Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, have been led by younger people. While they also used the internet and social media for mass mobilization, the \u201cGen Z\u201d protesters are taking it to another level.",
      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",
      "Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",
      "Over the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues. Later, some of them also used the gaming chat platform Discord to suggest who to nominate as an interim leader for the country.",
      "\u201cWhatever movement happens, whether against corruption or injustice, it spreads through digital media. The same happened in Nepal. The changes that took place after the Gen Z protests in Nepal spread globally through digital platforms, influencing other countries as well,\u201d said protester Yujan Rajbhandari.",
      "He said the protests in Nepal awakened not only the youth but also other generations.",
      "\u201cWe realized that we are global citizens and the digital space connects us all and plays a powerful role across the world,\u201d Rajbhandari said.",

      "Researchers think they have debunked the origin of Chicago's so-called \u201crat hole,\u201d one of the Windy City's weirdest local landmarks.",
      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "HONG KONG -- HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong lawmakers passed a bill Wednesday to regulate online ride-hailing services, requiring platforms like Uber, along with their vehicles and drivers, to be licensed, after years of backlash from the city's taxi industry.",
      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region. Licensed companies will need to maintain \u201cproper and efficient\u201d services and ensure all vehicles and drivers on their platforms hold valid permits, according to the new rules.",
      "Drivers are required to be at least 21, have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. They also need to pass a test and take a pre-service course.",
      "The bill marks an important step in the development of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong, which currently bans drivers of private vehicles from providing paid services to customers without a permit.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the voting results. \u201cThis decision marks a significant milestone in integrating ridesharing into the city\u2019s transport system and ensuring riders and drivers benefit from clear rules,\u201d it said.",

      "A platform that arranges cars or drivers without valid permits to serve passengers could be punished by a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,286) per violation on a first conviction. For subsequent conviction, the maximum jail term would double, in addition to a higher fine.",

      "The previous time the World Series was played north of the border, the Steroids Era was just starting, advanced analytics were science fiction and complete games were thrown about twice a month.",
      "While the Dodgers may be the favorite, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and the Blue Jays have an entire country behind them after rallying to win the American League Championship Series with a 4-3 victory over Seattle in Game 7 on Monday night.",
      "Until now, Toronto's only World Series appearances resulted in back-to-back titles in 1992 and '93.",
      "\u201cYou always feel the weight of the world in decisions you make but when you\u2019re kind of feeling a country, it kind of gets a little dicey at times,\u201d manager John Schneider said early in the postseason. \u201cSixth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out and Aaron Judge hitting, you feel like people in Nova Scotia want to come murder you.\u201d",
      "George Springer and the AL East champion Blue Jays have home-field advantage in the best-of-seven Series because they finished the regular season with 94 wins, one more than the NL West champion Dodgers.",
      "\u201cThey just got all their guys rolling. They\u2019re scoring seven, eight runs, 10 runs a game, so that\u2019s tough to slow down,\" Los Angeles shortstop Mookie Betts said. \"They\u2019re doing all three facets of the game.\u201d",
      "Seeking the franchise\u2019s ninth title and eighth since bolting Brooklyn for Los Angeles after the 1957 season, the Dodgers have overrun opponents during the postseason. Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person.",
      "\u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he\u2019s not just made of steel,\u201d teammate Freddie Freeman said.",
      "Before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show last Friday night, Ohtani\u2019s bat had been slumping.",
      "He\u2019s hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings.",
      "Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time since 2017 and is seeking its third championship in six years. The Dodgers are the first defending champion to reach the Fall Classic since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Yankees in six games.",
      "No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. The gap is the longest in baseball history, topping the previous high between the 1977-78 Yankees and the 1992-93 Blue Jays.",
      "In other U.S. major leagues, the longest Super Bowl title gap was between the 2004-05 New England Patriots and the 2023-24 Kansas City Chiefs, the longest in the NBA was between the 1968-69 Boston Celtics and the 1987-88 Los Angeles Lakers, and the lengthiest in the NHL was between the 1997-98 Detroit Red Wings and the 2016-17 Pittsburgh Penguins.",
      "\u201cRealizing how hard it is to do last year, realizing how hard it was in \u201920, it\u2019s special,\u201d Dodgers catcher Will Smith said. \u201cTrying to get back-to-back is even more special.\u201d",

      "Scientists have reported an encouraging trend in the population growth of the North Atlantic right whale",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 One of the rarest whales on the planet has continued an encouraging trend of population growth in the wake of new efforts to protect the giants animals, according to scientists who study them.",
      "The North Atlantic right whale now numbers an estimated 384 animals, up eight whales from the previous year, according to a report by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium released Tuesday. The whales have shown a trend of slow population growth over the past four years.",
      "It's a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The whale's trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium's Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. The center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration collaborate to calculate the population estimate.",
      "New management measures in Canada that attempt to keep the whales safe amid their increased presence in the Gulf of St. Lawrence have been especially important, Hamilton said.",
      "\u201cWe know that a modest increase every year, if we can sustain it, will lead to population growth,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIt's just whether or not we can sustain it.\u201d",
      "Scientists have cautioned in recent years that the whale's slow recovery is happening at a time when the giant animals still face threats from accidental deaths, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said.",
      "The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whale because they aren't producing enough babies to sustain their population, they've said.",

      "And any number of calves is helpful in a year of no mortalities, said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at Cabot Center and chairs the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium",
      "\u201cThe slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,\u201d Pettis said. \u201dWhat we've seen before is this population can turn on a dime.\"",
      "The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food.",

      "Prosecutors are backing off a bit after getting a misdemeanor conviction against a record-setting mountain runner in a national park",
      "Michelino Sunseri climbed past boulders on his way to a record-breaking feat: The extreme runner reached the summit of Grand Teton, one of the highest mountains in the American West, and then rushed back down, all in less than three hours.",
      "The National Park Service, however, didn\u2019t celebrate. Instead, it charged him with a crime.",
      "In September, Sunseri, 33, was found guilty of a misdemeanor for spending just two minutes during the run on a prohibited trail in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.",
      "The remarkable solo triumph in 2024 has been overshadowed by his legal saga. \u201cFree Michelino\u201d stickers are on posts and benches in Jackson, Wyoming. Sunseri\u2019s supporters, including members of Congress, are appalled by what they consider to be a glaring example of excessive enforcement by the government.",
      "Sunseri hasn't been sentenced yet, and now he could be getting a break. Federal prosecutors last week said the charge could be dismissed if he meets certain conditions over 12 months and the judge agrees. A hearing is set for Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors have repeatedly said the ban on shortcutting designated trails is on the park\u2019s website, the park map, in the park newspaper and also posted at trailheads. They pressed ahead with a two-day trial last May, despite a lack of support from officials in the new Trump administration.",
      "Joey Wilson of Salt Lake City, an ultramarathoner who designs training programs for athletes, said the significance of Sunseri\u2019s achievement sometimes gets lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable thing that he accomplished \u2014 world class,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Sunseri defends himself by saying he took the same route as many previous record holders on Grand Teton, including Kilian Jornet, one of the world's greatest mountain athletes, in 2012, without any blowback from the Park Service.",
      "He set out on Sept. 2, 2024, sharing the mountain with Labor Day holiday hikers. The path starts flat and wide before becoming extremely rocky on the way up.",
      "\u201cThere are boulders the size of small houses,\u201d said Wilson, whose father was a park ranger. \u201cYou've got to use your hands. If your hands were to pop off in a couple of places, you're going to fall a long way down.\u201d",
      "Sunseri also had to confront a series of switchbacks as the Garnet Canyon Trail zigged and zagged like a maze. On his way down, shirtless and wearing a hat backwards, he made a split-second decision that would later land him in court: He left a switchback to avoid casual hikers and possible injury, taking a path known as the Old Climber's Trail for two minutes.",
      "\u201cI was ahead of pace,\u201d said Sunseri, who had trained by running the mountain more than 40 times. \u201cI knew I was going to get the record regardless of which trail I took. I didn't want to be yelling at people to get out of my way.\u201d",
      "A small sign where he entered the trail says, \u201cShort Cutting Causes Erosion,\u201d while another at the other end says, \u201cClosed For Regrowth.\u201d Sunseri said there was no vegetation to destroy on the steep, narrow, hard-packed ground.",

      "Sunseri had run a total of 13.3 miles (21.4 kilometers) while gaining an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,133 meters) on his way up the mountain. The summit rests at 13,775 feet (4,198 meters).",
      "\u201cI was stoked,\" he recalled. \u201cIt's one of those things where every single thing has to go right \u2014 and everything did go right.\u201d",
      "Andy Anderson didn\u2019t bypass switchbacks during his record run in 2012, but Sunseri said he still had his blessing. They had dinner in Truckee, California, and Anderson handed over the prize: a handmade box bearing a commemorative belt buckle and listing the names of past Grand Teton record holders.",
      "Sunseri wrote about his epic run on social media. Those words doomed him. Federal investigators used search warrants to get access to the posts, which led to a misdemeanor charge of shortcutting a designated trail in the national park.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick found him guilty in a 51-page opinion released in September. She noted the testimony of Park Service Ranger Michelle Altizer, who said Sunseri's \u201cactions were high profile\u201d and that the potential to deter others was \u201cvery high and an important consideration\u201d in citing him.",
      "Sunseri's lawyers argued that the signs on Old Climber's Trail did not explicitly prohibit entry.",
      "\u201cThe trail has been sitting in its current state for decades,\u201d Wilson told The Associated Press. \u201cIf they really wanted to close that trail they could plant seeds over it and put a log down. Trail closed. Do not cross.\u201d",
      "After the spring trial, emails obtained by the defense team revealed that Park Service officials in Washington had told prosecutors on the eve of trial that they were withdrawing their support. A U.S. Interior Department lawyer referred to President Donald Trump's order \u201cfighting overcriminalization\u201d in federal regulations.",
      "\u201cWe're continuing with the prosecution,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Romine in Wyoming wrote back.",
      "Because of the court case, Sunseri's performance on Grand Teton is not being recognized by fastestknowntime.com, a website for the best times on routes considered to have remarkable scenery or historical and cultural value around the world.",
      "In Congress, U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is sponsoring a bill that would make willful intent a requirement for prosecuting certain crimes like Sunseri's trail-cutting misdemeanor. He called the case a \u201cprime example of the problem of overcriminalization.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 A lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. court in Honolulu challenges an admissions policy of a wealthy and prestigious private school that gives preference to applicants who are Native Hawaiian.",
      "A leading opponent of affirmation action launched a campaign last month to test the policy's legality and stop Kamehameha Schools from favoring Hawaiians. It's part of a movement to expand the legal definition of racial discrimination in education, which comes on the heels of a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and is bolstered by the Trump administration\u2019s war against diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, they\u2019re targeting scholarships, academic programs and admissions policies tied directly or indirectly to race.",
      "The lawsuit was expected after Students for Fair Admissions \u2014 led by Edward Blum, a leading opponent of affirmative action \u2014 set up a website posing the question, \u201cIs your child barred from Kamehameha Schools based on ancestry?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit doesn't include any named or anonymous plaintiffs other than Students for Fair Admissions. The complaint says the group has members who are \u201cinjured by Kamehameha's discrimination,\" and members who are \u201cready and able\u201d to apply to the Hawaii private school system, which has an endowment valued at more than $15 billion.",
      "\"We are ready for this challenge,\" trustees said in a statement. \u201cThe facts and the law are on our side, and we are confident that we will prevail.\u201d",
      "Kamehameha Schools was founded by the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha I. When she died in 1884, her will directed the establishment of schools that give preference to Native Hawaiians.",
      "Each year, the number of applications exceeds the number of spaces by as much as 17 to 1, depending on the campus and grade, according to the Kamehameha website. Alumni and parents of current students say a Kamehameha education is highly desirable because it's affordable, offers stellar academics and is grounded in the culture of Hawaii's Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cNothing about training future leaders, or preserving Hawaii\u2019s unique culture, requires Kamehameha to block its students from learning beside children of different ancestries \u2014 Asian, black, Hispanic, or white,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "There\u2019s an understanding among Hawaii residents that only students with Hawaiian blood will be admitted. Many see the policy as a way to remedy disparities stemming from U.S. colonization and the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by a group of American business owners.",
      "The lawsuit says that if not for the admissions policy, there are non-Hawaiian families who would apply for reasons including: \u201cbad experiences with local public schools,\u201d Kamehameha's \u201chigh-quality programs\u201d and for its networking and career opportunities.",
      "This isn't the first time Kamehameha has had to defend its admissions policy.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The mass evacuation by military aircraft of hundreds of residents from Alaska villages ravaged by the remnants of Typhoon Halong is complete, and officials and local leaders are turning attention to trying to stabilize damaged infrastructure and housing where they can before the winter freeze sets in.",
      "The focus of major response efforts following back-to-back storms that battered western Alaska has been the Yup\u2019ik communities of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, which are near the Bering Sea and have histories of flooding. While more than a dozen communities reported damage from the remnants of Halong earlier this month, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were devastated by storm surge and water levels that reached record highs.",
      "Homes were swept away, some with people inside. Winds in the region shook and tossed buildings like toys. First responders recounted rescuing people from rooftops. One person died, and two remain missing.",
      "Initial estimates suggest 90% of buildings were destroyed in Kipnuk, with the fresh water supply seemingly contaminated by fuel and sewage, according to a report released Monday by Alaska\u2019s emergency management division. About 35% of buildings in Kwigillingok were destroyed, the report states.",
      "The Alaska Federation of Natives passed a resolution during its annual convention that ended Saturday in support of expansive, urgent and ongoing help for the region.",
      "The group is the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, and its meeting in Anchorage coincided with the temporary relocation last week of hundreds of people to shelters in the city, which is Alaska's largest and about 500 miles (804.7 kilometers) from some of the tiny villages where residents rely heavily on hunting and fishing as part of their culture.",
      "The resolution, among other things, urges the state and federal governments \u201cto make sustained investments in permanent Alaska Arctic infrastructure and protective measures\u201d and to strengthen ties with tribes \u201cto ensure a consistent federal presence and equitable access to resources for remote communities across the Bering Sea and Arctic regions.\u201d",
      "Funds for community resilience or aimed at mitigating disaster risks have been called into question by President Donald Trump's administration, with efforts to cancel them being challenged in court. Alaska's U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have said they would make the case for the importance of such funds in Alaska, where numerous rural communities face threats from coastal erosion and thawing permafrost that require significant infrastructure updates \u2014 and in some cases, relocation.",
      "The Alaska Federation of Natives' resolution also urged the federal government to establish a regional response hub in the southwest Alaska community of Bethel and to provide funds for village public safety officers to aid in response efforts. And it asks governments at all levels to discourage \u201cany barriers that would inhibit hunting and fishing practices\u201d to replenish fish, moose meat and other subsistence and traditional foods that Native people lost in the storm.",
      "The remoteness of the region requires goods to be shipped in by barge or brought in by air. Hunting and fishing helps supplement food available at local groceries that can be limited and often expensive.",
      "On Monday, 65 displaced students began classes in Anchorage schools. Anchorage School District staff over the weekend met with families in the shelters set up in the city and helped register children for school, the district said in a statement.",

      "Here is what to know about the data centers in Northern Virginia where the outage originated, and what the malfunction reveals about a rapidly evolving industry.",
      "Cloud computing is a technology that allows companies to remotely access massive computing equipment and services without having to purchase and maintain physical infrastructure.",
      "In other words, businesses ranging from Snapchat to McDonald's essentially rent Amazon's physical infrastructure located in places all around the world to operate their own websites. Instead of building expensive computing systems in-house, companies rely on Amazon to store data, develop and test software and deliver applications.",

      "President Donald Trump has expressed confidence in reaching a \"fantastic deal\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. commands \u201cgreat respect\u201d from Beijing and that he will reach a \u201cfantastic deal\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet soon.",
      "Trump's remarks come after Beijing infuriated him by expanding export controls on rare earth products that are used in smartphones, fighter jets, electric vehicles and more. Trump spoke as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House, celebrating an agreement with the U.S. ally as a potential counterpoint to China's near-monopoly in processing those critical minerals.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s going to be a great trade deal. It\u2019s going to be fantastic for both countries, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "When asked about China's leverage, Trump said Beijing \u201cthreatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs.\" But he insisted his good relationship with Xi means they would work out \u201da very fair deal.\"",
      "All eyes are on a potential meeting between Trump and Xi because any failure to reach some agreement raises the risk of destabilizing not only relations between the two superpowers but also the global economy.",
      "Trump affirmed that he would meet with Xi this month on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, a grouping of 21 economies. Beijing has not announced plans for Xi to make the trip to South Korea, but it's not unusual for such details to emerge closer to the travel date.",
      "The president has threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on China in response to Beijing\u2019s expanded rules on rare earth products. And he said Monday that it has already had results.",
      "\u201cNow, they\u2019re treating us with great respect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see what happens. I said, if we don\u2019t make a deal, I\u2019m putting on an additional 100% on November 1. I think we\u2019ll make a deal.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has levied additional 30% across-the-board tariffs on China. Trump said the total rate on Chinese goods is about 55% to 57% and the country has paid the U.S. \u201chundreds of billions of dollars worth of money for tariffs.\u201d",
      "Beijing, however, has indicated it would play hardball.",
      "\u201cThreatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said last week in response to Trump's new tariffs threat.",
      "When asked if the 100% tariff could stand and how it could affect the economy, Trump told Fox Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo last week that \u201cit\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "At the meeting with Albanese, Trump said he has other options to use against China: \u201cThey can\u2019t get parts for their airplanes. We build their airplanes.\u201d",

      "The United States is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan, which split from China in 1949 during a civil war. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and vows to seize it by force if necessary to achieve what it says to be \u201cthe unification of the motherland.\u201d",

No reason was given.",
      "He was replaced by Li Yongjie, deputy international trade representative, who recently held trade talks with Ecuador.",
      "The announcement coincided with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent criticisms of Li Chenggang.

      "\u201cHe showed up uninvited in Washington and said, quote, China will cause global chaos if the port shipping fees go through,\u201d Bessent said, referring to the U.S. plan to charge port fees on China-linked vessels.",
      "Late last week, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng had a video call with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The sides held a \u201ccandid, in-depth and constructive exchange\u201d and agreed to hold a new round of trade talks as soon as possible, according to China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency.",

      "The judge took into account Cleary\u2019s guilty plea, his remorse and his long history of mental illness in giving a sentence below state guidelines. Cleary, 32, said he sent the messages as part of a 12-step program, in hopes of seeking atonement.",

      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last week ordered uniformed agents to wear cameras, if available, and turn them on when engaged in arrests, frisks and building searches or when being deployed to protests. She held a hearing Monday at which she questioned a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official and a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement official about the operation and complaints that agents are increasingly using combative tactics.",
      "Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with CBP, said Border Patrol agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz have cameras. He said 201 are in the Chicago area.",
      "But Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for ICE, said more money from Congress would be needed to expand camera use beyond two of that agency's field offices. He said no cameras have been worn by ICE agents working at a building in Broadview, outside Chicago, where immigrants pass through before being detained elsewhere. It's been the site of protests that at times have been tumultuous.",
      "Byers also explained that while there are surveillance cameras outside the ICE facility, they record over previous footage every 28 days. Ellis expressed surprise when Byers said that meant footage from before Sept. 18 was gone. The Broadview facility became a focus of protesters after Operation Midway Blitz began in early September.",
      "\u201cAll of that needs to be preserved,\u201d Ellis said.",
      "Near the end of the hearing, Ellis said she would allow attorneys to question additional federal officials, including Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who is leading CBP's Chicago operation and also was central to the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles.",
      "The hearing was part of a lawsuit by news organizations and community groups witnessing protests and arrests in the Chicago area. Ellis said earlier this month that agents must wear badges, and she banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists.",

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent\u2019s rich rare-earth resources at a time when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.",
      "The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.",
      "\u201cIn about a year from now we\u2019ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won\u2019t know what to do with them,\" said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. \"They\u2019ll be worth $2.\u201d",
      "Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \u201cto the next level.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.",
      "\u201cAustralia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we\u2019re seeing from the Chinese,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Albanese.",
      "Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.",
      "The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce its dominance.",
      "Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.",
      "For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.",
      "\"I think taking away that arrow in the quiver of China to manipulate pricing is an absolute crucial first step in Australia and the West being able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our supply chain demands,\u201d said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.",
      "The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China's influence.",
      "\u201cChina is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. \u201cThey are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That\u2019s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "But Althaus cautioned that Australia can\u2019t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said on Monday that it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since its 2022 decision expanding gun rights.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration asked the justices to revive a case against a Texas man charged with a felony because he allegedly had a gun in his home and acknowledged being a regular pot user. The Justice Department appealed after a lower court largely struck down a law that bars people who use any illegal drugs from having guns.",
      "Arguments probably will take place early in 2026, with a decision likely by early summer.",
      "The Republican administration favors Second Amendment rights, but government attorneys argued that this ban is a justifiable restriction.",
      "They asked the court to reinstate a case against Ali Danial Hemani. His lawyers got the felony charge tossed out after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the blanket ban is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s expanded view of gun rights. The appellate judges found it could still be used against people accused of being high and armed at the same time, though.",
      "Hemani's attorneys argue the broadly written law puts millions of people at risk of technical violations since at least 20% of Americans have tried pot, according to government health data. About half of states legalized recreational marijuana, but it's still illegal under federal law.",

The gun charge was the only one filed, however, and his lawyers said the other allegations were irrelevant and were mentioned only to make him seem more dangerous.",
      "The case marks another flashpoint in the application of the Supreme Court's new test for firearm restrictions. The conservative majority found in 2022 that the Second Amendment generally gives people the right to carry guns in public for self-defense and any firearm restrictions must have a strong grounding in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "The landmark 2022 ruling led to a cascade of challenges to firearm laws around the country, though the justices have since upheld a different federal law intended to protect victims of domestic violence by barring guns from people under restraining orders.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A Utah judge on Monday sentenced a man who appeared to fake his death and flee the United States to avoid arrest on rape charges to anywhere from five years to life in prison.",
      "Nicholas Rossi, 38, is \u201ca serial abuser of women\u201d and \u201cthe very definition of a flight risk,\u201d District Judge Barry Lawrence said before handing down the sentence.",
      "It was Rossi's first of two sentencings after separate convictions in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November in the second case.",
      "Utah allows prison sentences to be given as a range rather than a set period of time. A parole board will determine if and when Rossi is released. Five years to life is the entire range of possible prison time under Utah law for rape, a first-degree felony.",
      "Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.",
      "Rossi left a \u201ctrail of fear, pain and destruction\u201d behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.",
      "\u201cThis is not a plea for vengeance,\" she said. \u201cThis is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal.\u201d",
      "Rossi posed a risk to community safety and should be in prison, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, before the sentencing. Rossi's lawyers, meanwhile, urged the judge to give him parole.",
      "Rossi did not testify on his own behalf during the trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, he maintained his innocence.",
      "\u201cI am not guilty of this. These women are lying,\u201d Rossi said in a soft, raspy voice. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and used an oxygen tank.",
      "Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.",

      "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.",
      "In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.",
      "That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. \u201cThis rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.",
      "It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\u201cChina is learning from the best,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \u201cBeijing is copying Washington\u2019s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.\"",
      "He added: \u201cGame recognizes game.\"",
      "It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.",
      "Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's \u201centity list\u201d that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.",
      "In 2021, Beijing adopted the anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies such as the Chinese Foreign Ministry to deny visas and freeze the assets of unwelcome individuals and businesses \u2014 similar to what the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Treasury can do.",
      "Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be \u201chitting back with the enemy's methods.\u201d",
      "The law \u201chas combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,\u201d said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report.

      "Other formal measures Beijing has adopted in the past several years include expanded export controls and foreign investment review tools.",
      "Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often \u201cvery parallel\u201d to those of the U.S., he said.",
      "Both governments also have adopted a \u201cholistic view of national security,\u201d which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.",
      "When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.",
      "In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.",
      "That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.",
      "In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "Then came the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.",
      "While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.",
      "\u201cThe dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,\u201d he said. And second, \"in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.\u201d",

      "Born Paul Daniel Frehley into a musical family, he played guitar since age 13, and performed with bands around New York City. At 18 he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix.",
      "In 1973 Frehley joined with singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss to form Kiss. Their earliest albums did not sell well, but their stage antics \u2014 replete with pyrotechnics and stage blood, and guitars that emitted smoke during solos \u2014 earned them a following. By 1976 their albums \"Destroyer\" and \"Rock and Roll Over\" went platinum, and 1977's \"Love Gun\" hit #4 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Frehley frequently feuded with fellow band members Stanley and Simmons, and left Kiss in 1982.",
      "He performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley's Comet, before rejoining Kiss in the mid-1990s, reclaiming his persona of \"The Spaceman,\" or \"Space Ace.\" He stayed until 2002, when he resumed recording solo and with Frehley's Comet.",
      "The original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "In 2024 Frehley told Guitar World magazine, \"I'm always flattered when people tell me I influenced them. If I knew I was going to influence thousands of guitar players, I would have practiced more!\u00a0 I laugh, but that's the truth. \u2026 I've had so many players come up to me and say, 'You are the reason I play guitar,' and I'm always like, 'Wow.'\""

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:40:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",

      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year.

      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",

      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",

      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP \u00a0[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",

      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

      "They are due to be paid again Oct. 28, but they are at risk of missing that paycheck if the government shutdown persists, Duffy said.

Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",

      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 09:25:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

Foods between Sept. 17 and Oct. 14,\u00a0said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on public health regulations.",
      "Its announcement cited seven different types of frozen breakfast products that could be tainted. They are distributed to low-income students around the country as part of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, which the Department of Agriculture administers. The breakfast program served more than 14 million children in 2016, and close to 30 million children participated in the lunch program in 2019, according to the department.",
      "There are no confirmed reports of illnesses tied to the recalled products, which include burritos and wraps sold by the brands El Mas Fino, Los Cabos and Midamar and contain egg, cheese and various meats like beef, ham, sausage and turkey, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The agency said it recalled those products after the manufacturer discovered listeria while conducting routine testing on egg ingredients from its external suppliers.",
      "\"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional refrigerators of freezers,\" said the agency. \"Institutions are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away.\"",
      "Listeria is an infection caused by bacteria of the same name that spreads through food. Fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle aches, confusion, loss of balance and a range of gastrointestinal problems are some of the symptoms brought on by the illness,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic warns that pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of developing a harmful infection.",
      "People can be infected with listeria without becoming seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has estimated that listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,250 people contracting the infection and 172 dying from the infection each year.",
      "Public health officials note that flu-like symptoms caused by listeria can signal an \"invasive\" infection, meaning one that has spread from the gastrointestinal tract, where symptoms may start, to other parts of the body. These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:51:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The rush for gold continues as economic uncertainty deepens and anxious investors seek a safe haven for their money.",
    "story": [
      "As economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.",
      "The going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.",
      "Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.",
      "Gold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.",
      "Silver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.",
      "As a result, hiring has plunged\u00a0while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.",
      "Separately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "And on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.",
      "Gold jewelry sticker shock",
      "Many jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.",
      "At the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.",
      "Larger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic\u00a0growth has accelerated\u00a0in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.",
      "Not always a reliable inflation hedge",
      "Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.",
      "The frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences \u2014 with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks \u2014 putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.",
      "The Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world."

      "The class action lawsuit, filed Oct. 9 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, claims the customers wouldn't have bought the shoes if they had known about the noise.

      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.",
      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",

      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",

    "summary": "The U.S. population of people over 65 is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years, but many aren't prepared for longevity, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",
      "Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International, said that Chen was embedded in the Cambodian elite and \"well protected\" by the government, showing \"the larger role that Cambodia has played as a safe center for this online scamming to prosper.\" Chen was formerly a personal adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",

      "Monday's filing \u2014 which argues Comey is the victim of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's \"personal animus\" toward him \u2014 marks the first time that court papers have named the person the Justice Department believes Comey authorized to leak. Several media outlets had previously reported that Richman was \"Person 3.\"",
      "Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to Comey's charges.",
      "Instead, the indictment focuses on a testy back-and-forth in 2020, when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Comey about whether he let a different person \u2014 former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 leak information about the Clinton probe to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe says he told Comey after the article came out that he authorized the leak, and Comey approved of it, but Comey has long insisted that no such conversation took place.",
      "Comey had previously told Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in 2017 that he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source in media coverage on the FBI's investigations into Clinton or Mr. Trump. Three years later, Cruz argued McCabe's statements about the Wall Street Journal leak contradicted that.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" Cruz said to Comey in 2020. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "In Monday's filing, Comey's attorneys cast the fact that Cruz didn't ask about Richman as a fatal flaw in the government's case against the ex-FBI chief, who was charged with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional investigation.",
      "The lawyers wrote: \"the indictment omits Senator Cruz's words that explicitly narrow the focus of his questions to Mr. McCabe and misleadingly implies that the questioning related to Mr. Richman.\"",
      "\"In other words, the indictment presents an inaccurate description of the testimony at the heart of this case,\" the court filing continued.",
      "His attorneys also argue the Justice Department's charges misquote Comey. The indictment says Comey falsely stated to the Senate that he hadn't \"authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports\" \u2014 but that exact phrase was actually used by Cruz and Grassley, not Comey. And the filing notes that Cruz used the phrase \"Clinton administration,\" not \"Clinton investigation.\"",
      "The filing says Comey is planning on asking for his false statement count to be dismissed \"based on a defense of literal truth.\" It referenced the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States, which said people who make literally true statements under oath aren't guilty of perjury.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department, Comey's attorneys and Richman for comment.",
      "What is Daniel Richman accused of doing?",
      "The indictment doesn't say what information the Justice Department believes Richman leaked to the media. It states only that Comey \"authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers confirmed in Monday's filing that \"Person 1\" referred to Clinton.",
      "The filing points to one FBI leak investigation involving Comey and Richman called \"Arctic Haze,\" which was detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year. Arctic Haze sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe.",
      "Richman was interviewed as part of Arctic Haze, according to the heavily redacted memo, which was published by the conservative-leaning site Just The News. The memo says Richman told FBI agents he had spoken with one of the authors of the Times article, but he didn't know how the reporter got a hold of the classified information, and Richman said he was \"sure 'with a discount'\" that he didn't tell the reporter himself.",
      "The memo describes Richman as Comey's \"liaison to the media,\" but also notes at one point: \"Richman later told the interviewing agents Comey never asked him to talk to the media.\"",
      "The Arctic Haze investigation closed without any charges. The memo said the probe \"has not yielded sufficient evidence to criminally charge any person, including Comey or Richman, with making false statements or with the substantive offenses under investigation.\"",
      "Separately, during the first Trump term, Comey was investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general for giving memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to Richman, who then provided their contents to a Times reporter. The internal watchdog found that Comey \"violated applicable policies\" but did not release any classified information.",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Comey of leaks and other nefarious conduct for almost a decade, stretching back to when he fired Comey as FBI director in 2017. The president has long criticized how Comey handled the FBI's probes into Clinton and the Trump campaign. Comey, for his part, has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit to be president.\"",
      "In Monday's court papers, Comey's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump's longstanding \"personal spite\" led to the charges against him, which were filed shortly before the statute of limitations expired.",
      "\"No reasonable prosecutor would have brought such a deficient case; the only explanation is that the President's handpicked interim U.S. Attorney did so to carry out the President's wishes,\" they wrote in a 51-page filing, which also included a 60-page attachment listing all of the verbal barbs flung between Comey and Mr. Trump over the years."

    "story": [
      "In footage shared widely on social media last week, federal immigration agents were seen breaking into Gloria Maga\u00f1a's home Portland, Oregon, even though the person they were looking for does not live there.",
      "The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Maga\u00f1a told CBS News.",
      "The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Maga\u00f1a, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.",
      "With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Maga\u00f1a's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.",
      "Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.",
      "\"Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,\" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.",
      "While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Maga\u00f1a's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Maga\u00f1a said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.",
      "ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Maga\u00f1a's son, Napoleon Maga\u00f1a, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.",
      "A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Maga\u00f1a's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.",
      "\"Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,\" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.",
      "As millions took to the streets over the weekend for \"No Kings\" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.",
      "\"They're not indiscriminate,\" he told CBS News. \"We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.\"",
      "Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.",
      "\"We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,\" he said. \"If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.\"",
      "Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.",
      "Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.",
      "On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.",
      "Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.",
      "\"We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,\" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. \"And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.\"",

    "summary": "Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey called the criminal charges against him an \"egregious abuse of power\" driven by \"President Trump's personal animus.\"",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey filed a slate of motions Monday seeking to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed before a potential trial date early next year, arguing he was charged because of \"President Trump's personal animus.\"",
      "Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and unlawful prosecution. He is also challenging the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan to that role.",
      "Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges arose due to an \"egregious abuse of power,\" and there are \"multiple glaring constitutional violations\" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey due to \"personal spite\" and because Comey had \"frequently criticized the President,\" who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has sparred with Comey for years.",
      "The requests were expected, as Fitzgerald previewed them when he appeared alongside Comey during his arraignment earlier this month. He is expected to file a second tranche of filings to toss out the charges in the coming weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff has set a hearing on the first set of motions for Nov. 19 in Alexandria, Virginia.",
      "Comey's attorneys said that even if the case is not dismissed for vindictive prosecution, \"concrete and objective facts justify thorough discovery into the suspect prosecutorial decision-making process that led to this flawed indictment and a hearing at which the government must justify its decision to bring these unfounded and retaliatory charges.\"",
      "His legal team says that \"absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted.\"",
      "In a separate motion, attorneys for Comey also argued that Halligan, the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign his indictment, \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney.\"",
      "Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "\"The President and Attorney General appointed the President's personal lawyer as interim U.S. Attorney in violation of a clear statutory command so that the interim U.S. Attorney could indict an outspoken critic of the President just days before the relevant statute of limitations was set to expire,\" Comey's lawyers wrote.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the pair of motions.",
      "Prosecutors raise doubts about Comey's attorney",
      "Federal prosecutors also indicated Sunday that they may seek to have Fitzgerald disqualified because of his alleged involvement in a so-called plan by Comey to leak the contents of a memo to the media shortly after Mr. Trump fired him as FBI director in 2017, during the president's first term.",
      "\"[B]ased on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,\" prosecutors Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, wrote in a filing. \"This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel.\"",
      "A Department of Justice Inspector General report found that Comey shared four memos with Fitzgerald in May 2017, who then forwarded them to two other lawyers working for Comey. Prosecutors are asking Nachmanoff to put in place a \"filter team\" to sift through evidence that may contain information shielded by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.",
      "Prosecutors' use of material protected by privilege can raise obstacles in the case, ranging from disqualification of that material to mistrial or dismissal of charges. Filter teams are typically groups of government attorneys who review documents and separate privileged information from non-privileged information before the material gets to prosecutors on a given case.",
      "Prosecutors said the evidence at issue in Comey's case includes communications between him and several lawyers, one of whom appears to be Fitzgerald. They wrote in their latest filing that the material subject to review by the filter team \"could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for\" Fitzgerald.",
      "But Comey's lawyers accused prosecutors of attempting to \"defame\" Fitzgerald and noted that the Justice Department's internal watchdog \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media.\" The Justice Department in 2019 declined to prosecute Comey for his handling of the memos.",
      "Halligan is the latest DOJ prosecutor to face court challenges",
      "Comey was charged in September with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts at his arraignment.",
      "Because Comey is challenging Halligan's appointment to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Nachsmanoff, who sits on the bench in the district, will have to recuse himself, and a judge from outside of the district will hear arguments on that motion.",
      "The challenge to Halligan's appointment comes after defendants in New Jersey and Nevada successfully challenged similar U.S. attorney appointments President Trump made in those two states in recent weeks, as the administration has attempted to bypass the Senate confirmation process for these positions around the country.",
      "A federal judge in August found that Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, is serving \"without lawful authority\" as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Weeks later, a federal judge ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada, was also serving illegally in her role.",
      "Halligan, one of Mr. Trump's former defense lawyers who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Her appointment came days after Erik Siebert, who had been the top federal prosecutor in Eastern Virginia, resigned amid concerns he would be forced out for not prosecuting another of Mr. Trump's foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, for alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "James was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia earlier this month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. She has called the charges \"baseless.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi has invoked a provision of federal law that addresses U.S. attorney vacancies to install people in these posts temporarily. The law allows an appointee to serve 120 days as interim U.S. attorney and gives district court judges in the area the authority to keep them in the role or tap a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Siebert was installed as the interim U.S. attorney in January, and the judges there had extended his appointment as U.S. attorney for the region in May.",
      "But in the challenge to Habba's appointment to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann found that the attorney general is given 120 total days to appoint an interim U.S. attorney. The judge agreed that the law allows different individuals to be appointed interim U.S. attorney, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "Allowing the 120-day clock to reset with the selection of each new temporary U.S. attorney would allow the president \"to staff the United States Attorney's office with individuals of his personal choice for an entire term without seeking the Senate's advice and consent,\" Brann wrote.",
      "While that conclusion does not bind the judge who will consider the validity of Halligan's appointment in Virginia, Fitzpatrick's motion points to Habba's case as part of the government's attempt to \"end run\" Congress' authority on judicial nominations and appointments, adding: \"This Court should reject the government's machinations here.\"",
      "Comey charged after sparring with Trump for years",
      "Comey has long been a political opponent of Mr. Trump's, and the president has for years taken to social media to attack the former FBI director. Mr. Trump has lambasted Comey for his handling of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's associates. Mr. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, and Robert Mueller, who was named special counsel just over a week after Comey's ouster, then took over the probe.",
      "The indictment of the former FBI chief came days after Mr. Trump took to social media to voice frustration with Bondi for not bringing criminal charges against Comey and two other political opponents: James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, both Democrats.",
      "In his message to Bondi, Mr. Trump called the trio \"guilty as hell\" and wrote, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "While claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, former prosecutors have said the circumstances surrounding Comey's indictment could be a boon to his lawyers in having the charges tossed out.",
      "Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Fitzgerald said at Comey's arraignment that there will be another slate of motions filed by Nov. 20 also challenging the case against him, including claims of grand jury abuse and \"outrageous conduct\" by the Justice Department.",
      "Grounds for a motion alleging abuse of the grand jury process can include possible improper legal instructions given by the prosecutor to the grand jury, an intentional withholding of information that would exonerate the defendant or indictments obtained as a means of retaliation."

      "The president told reporters in September that construction had begun, though at the time, no part of the White House building had been demolished.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a social media post by Mr. Trump Monday announcing that \"ground has been broken\" for the \"new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom.\"",
      "\"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State visits, etc.,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway \u2014 with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!\"",
      "The East Wing of the White House is fairly small and is where the first lady's office and staff are located.",
      "\"It won't interfere with the current building,\" the president said in July. \"It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of.\"",
      "The White House says the project, which will cost $250 million, has been fully funded by private contributions from business and big tech, including Apple, Microsoft and Coinbase. Earlier this month, ballroom donors dined at the White House with Mr. Trump.",
      "By September, a number of companies had pledged to donate $5 million or more for the addition, multiple sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650. Mr. Trump said it will have bulletproof glass windows on all sides.",
      "CBS News previously obtained\u00a0renderings of the ballroom."

    "summary": "A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in favor of the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to mobilize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed to freeze a lower court order that had blocked the Trump administration from sending Oregon National Guard troops to Portland to protect federal immigration personnel and property.",
      "In its 2-1 ruling, the majority found the Trump administration is likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal by establishing that President Trump lawfully invoked a law known as Title 10 to bring Oregon's National Guard into federal service and send them to Portland.",
      "\"The statute delegates the authority to make that determination to the President and does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider in doing so,\" Judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, both appointed to the 9th Circuit by Mr. Trump, said in the opinion for the court.",
      "The judges found that the \"rather than reviewing the president's determination with great deference,\" the district court \"substituted\" its own findings related to the circumstances in Portland.",
      "\"Considering the totality of the circumstances, there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\" the majority found.",
      "Judge Susan Graber dissented and urged the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the case \"before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.\"",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield echoed Graber's call and encouraged the Portland community to ensure the city remains \"peaceful and safe\" while the legal proceedings continue.",
      "\"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he said in a statement. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Mr. Trump, had issued two temporary orders earlier this month regarding the president's federalization and deployment of National Guard members. The first forbade the administration from mobilizing Oregon National Guard troops and sending them to Portland, a decision that was appealed to the 9th Circuit. But the second prevented the administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members in Oregon.",
      "The Justice Department did not appeal that second decision, arguing instead that because it relies on the same legal reasoning as the first order regarding the Oregon National Guard, the district court would be required to dissolve it if the Trump administration succeeded in their bid for emergency relief. The 9th Circuit said in its decision that it agrees with the Trump administration that \"the first TRO and the second TRO rise or fall together on the merits of the issues raised in this motion for a stay pending appeal.\"",
      "The dispute involving Portland began in late September, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon. Mr. Trump's move came in response to protests outside of an immigration facility in Portland, some of which have turned violent. The president said on social media that he was sending in troops to protect the \"war ravaged\" city and immigration facilities from \"Antifa and other domestic terrorists,\" and was authorizing \"full force, if necessary.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then issued a directive placing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard under federal control to protect immigration personnel and property at the immigration facility in Portland.",
      "Oregon officials, however, objected to the deployment, and they filed a lawsuit arguing that Mr. Trump lacked the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Immergut, the district judge presiding over the case, swiftly issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from implementing the September directive that ordered the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard.",
      "The judge found that Mr. Trump's determination that the National Guard had to be federalized because of the situation on the ground in Portland was \"untethered to the facts,\" and said that while the president is entitled to significant deference, that is \"not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.\"",
      "But following that order, the Trump administration said it would be sending 300 members of California's National Guard to Portland. Mr. Trump had deployed members of the state's National Guard in Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement actions, and the 9th Circuit allowed their continued deployment in June.",
      "Immergut issued her second decision blocking the Trump administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members, which the Justice Department did not appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump has relied on as law known as Title 10 to bring members of state-run National Guards under federal control and has sought to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. The law allows the president to federalize members of any state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the regular forces or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "In its decision, the 9th Circuit ruled that \"there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The judges found that the district court discounted \"violent and disruptive events\" that occurred between June and August, some of which forced the closure of the ICE facility for several weeks. The president, they said, is \"entitled, and indeed, duty-bound, to evaluate the entire context of events leading up a decision to invoke\" Title 10.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to major U.S. cities has divided federal appeals courts. While the 9th Circuit has sided with the president in the early stages of cases challenging the president's deployment of troops from the Oregon and California National Guards, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit has prevented the administration from sending Illinois National Guard troops into Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, setting up an early test of the president's authority to mobilize and deploy National Guard troops over the objections of local leaders."

    "summary": "The Australian prime minister said the critical minerals deal takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",
      "Albanese said the critical minerals deal also signals the strong partnership between the U.S. and Australia.",
      "\"We are great friends and we're great allies,\" Albanese said Monday. \"And this is a relationship that's been forged in the battlefields of the world. We have stood side by side for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "The White House said Australia is also making new defense investments, including the purchase of $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles. Since February, the White House said Australia has contributed $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base. A trilateral security partnership called AUKUS involving the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which was first struck during the Biden administration \u2014 aims to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, and producing submarines for that region is a key part of that security alliance.",
      "\"We have the best submarines in the world, anywhere in the world,\" Mr. Trump said Monday."

      "Democrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions on Day 19 of the government shutdown, which has become the\u00a0third-longest funding lapse\u00a0in modern history. Last week, an effort to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate for a tenth time, as Republicans sought to peel off support from Democrats. But they've been unable to win over additional support since the shutdown began, as most Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government.",
      "Republicans in Congress have insisted that there's nothing to negotiate as Democrats have sought to sit down with GOP leaders and the president. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that he's told Democrats he's willing to guarantee a vote on the tax credits, though he can't guarantee an outcome. And in a post on X Friday, the South Dakota Republican added that he's willing to sit down with Democrats on the health care issue, but only under the condition that the shutdown ends.",
      "Kelly reiterated Democrats' position Sunday, saying, \"we want negotiations.\"",
      "\"What we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium \u2014 they're going to go up on Nov. 1 for people,\" the Arizona Democrat said, referring to an expected jump in health insurance premiums if Congress doesn't extend a set of enhanced tax credits. \"What we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.\"",
      "Though there have been conversations between lawmakers about how to reopen the government, congressional leaders have not met since the shutdown began, last gathering on Sept. 29 for a meeting with President Trump at the White House.",
      "\"The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress. That's it, one hour,\" Kelly said. \"They need to get in the room and stay in a room until we can hash this out. The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing, and he wants the government open. That's what we want.\"",
      "Sen. Britt: Democrats need to \"do the right thing\"",
      "Britt, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said, \"Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people,\" Britt said. \"And so getting the government open is number one.\"",
      "On extending the health insurance tax credits, Britt reiterated that Republicans are willing to discuss the issue, but only once the government is reopened.",
      "\"We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible,\" Britt said. \"They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.\"",
      "Britt said it's \"absolutely totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.\"",
      "\"Those two things do not match up, and Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open,\" she added."

A federal appeals court ruled that the law is unconstitutional in most cases, and the Trump administration said that decision should be reversed.",

      "The law at issue in the case is the latest longstanding firearm restriction to come under legal scrutiny in the years since the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry a firearm in public. In that landmark decision, the high court laid out a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions focusing on the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Since then, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of state bans on assault weapons, as well as federal laws barring felons and people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns. The high court in 2024 upheld the restriction targeting alleged domestic abusers, but has turned away the other cases.",
      "But the legal battles have continued to make their way to the Supreme Court, including over a provision of the 1968 Gun Control Act that prohibits a person \"who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\" from having a gun.",

He was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2023 for violating the drug-user-in-possession prohibition, related to what prosecutors said was his \"habitual\" use of marijuana.",
      "Hemani sought to have the indictment tossed out on the ground that the law violates the Second Amendment as applied to him, and a district court ordered it to be dismissed. While his case was proceeding, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in two other similar challenges that the prohibition is unconstitutional.",
      "In one of those cases, involving a \"nonviolent, marijuana-smoking gunowner,\" the 5th Circuit found that \"our history and tradition do not support disarming a sober person based solely on past substance usage,\" but may support \"some limits on a presently intoxicated person's right to carry a weapon.\"",
      "It went on to rule in Hemani's favor in light of that 2024 ruling.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision to the Supreme Court and wrote that the 5th Circuit was wrong to find that the Second Amendment precludes Congress from keeping habitual drug users from having firearms.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the firearms ban for illegal drug users complies with the Second Amendment, since it targets a category of people \"who pose a clear danger of misusing firearms: habitual users of unlawful drugs.\" He argued that the law prohibits gun possession temporarily \u2014 anyone who stops habitually using illegal substances can have firearms.",
      "\"The habitual drug user, in other words, always has the option of restoring his own right to keep and bear arms by simply forgoing the habitual use of unlawful drugs,\" Sauer wrote. \"But if he lacks the motivation or will to comply with the law because of addiction or other factors, that fact alone provides powerful evidence of society's interest in keeping him disarmed.\"",
      "Sauer compared the law to founding-era measures restricting the rights of drunkards, or those who abused alcohol habitually. He also noted that legislatures have been prohibiting drug addicts or users from having guns since the 1920s and 1930s. More than 30 states have laws barring drug users or addicts from possessing firearms.",
      "Hemani's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to turn his case away, arguing that the 5th Circuit's decision is \"exceedingly narrow.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",

      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid.

Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The lapse in government funding was the result of disagreement over providing aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and Democrats' push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, a policy from the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcast licensees to cover different sides of controversial issues. The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Bush said he would veto a short-term funding measure that did not include a plan to reduce the deficit, forcing a shutdown.

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",
      "Clinton and Republican congressional leaders ultimately reached a deal to fund the government for several weeks and allow negotiations to continue.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Duration: 34 days",
      "White House: Trump",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans/Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.

      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 09:20:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "story": [
      "Gaza's fragile ceasefire faced its first major test Sunday as Israeli forces launched a wave of deadly strikes, saying Hamas militants had killed two soldiers, and an Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory was halted.",
      "The military later said it resumed enforcing the ceasefire, and the official confirmed to The Associated Press that aid deliveries would resume Monday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Israel's military said it hit multiple targets in the Gaza Strip using aircraft and artillery, after it accused Hamas of shooting at Israeli soldiers. Military officials later said two soldiers were killed.",
      "An Israeli military official told CBS News that Hamas had targeted its soldiers with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire.",
      "\"Both of the incidents happened in an Israeli-controlled area, east of the yellow line,\" the official said. \"This is a bold violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Israel's security heads and his office said in a statement that he had directed the military to take \"strong action\" against what he called \"terrorist targets.\" He did not threaten to return to war.",
      "Hamas said that it was not involved in any of the clashes that had been reported earlier in Rafah in southern Gaza.",
      "\"We reaffirm our full commitment to implement everything that was agreed upon, foremost of which is a ceasefire across all areas of the Gaza Strip,\" the group's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of any incidents or clashes taking place in the Rafah area, as these are red zones under the occupation's control, and contact with the remaining groups of ours there has been cut off since the war resumed in March of this year.\"",
      "Hospital sources in Gaza told CBS News that at least 38 people have been killed in the territory since Sunday morning.",
      "Israel's military said it had struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets.",
      "Later on Sunday, Israel's military said that \"in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,\" it had begun \"re-enforcing the ceasefire following its violation by the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"The IDF will continue to enforce the ceasefire agreement and will respond forcefully to any violation of the agreement,\" the Israeli military said in a statement.",
      "Later Sunday night, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the ceasefire was still in effect, and blamed \"some rebels within\" Gaza, rather than Hamas itself, for the alleged breaches.",
      "\"But either way, it's going to be handled properly. It's going to be handled toughly, but properly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The strikes came as Israel\u00a0identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight, and the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed \"until further notice.\" The statement from Netanyahu's office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its obligation under the ceasefire deal to return the remains of all the deceased hostages. The bodies of 16 hostages, two of them foreign nationals, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli media.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. State Department\u00a0warned that it had received \"credible reports\"\u00a0indicating that Hamas may be planning an attack on \"Palestinian civilians\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The State Department did not provide any details on the timing or location of the possible attack, saying only that it \"would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts.\"",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died.",
      "The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza and future governance of the devastated territory."

      "After President Zelenskyy met with President Trump on Friday, he said they sort of agreed to disagree on whether to get these long-range missiles, these Tomahawks that would allow them to fire into Russia. Where does that stand? President Biden wouldn't do this either.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "So I spoke to Zelenskyy three weeks ago in New York right after his meeting with Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And we talked about Tomahawks in that meeting, much longer range, over 1,000 miles, 700-kil \u2013 700-pound warhead. They're really good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Game-changing?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Game-changing.",
      "The president said he would consider giving them these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: This weapon system, and then he had a conversation with Vladimir Putin.",
      "And I think it's important for people to recognize Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. He is a master manipulator. The president has one view. Then he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he changes his story on this. Of course Putin does not want Ukraine to get\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 a longer-range missile that could go after targets deep into Russia, beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, by the way. It can range targets much further. It's very accurate. It's a very survivable weapon.",
      "And Putin has a conversation with him and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle \u2013 if we can give them enough rounds, if we have them in our inventory and enough launchers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Ground launchers are rather new to the system, something we got rid of for a long period of time.",
      "They have demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this, and it would help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Zelenskyy says they're going to continue to try to persuade President Trump.",
      "I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican leader, John Thune, has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media.",
      "Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations on how to fix\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this enough?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 how to \u2013 I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium.",
      "They're going to go up on November 1 for people. They can't afford it. People in my state\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Either way, they're going up .",

      "This woman Emily (sp?), whose husband's a pastor, who has three kids, says, without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when premiums go up?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I would like to. I would like to \u2013 we should \u2013 we could \u2013 we should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us.",
      "The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT (R-Alabama): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things, but let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown.",
      "He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week. Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up, whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for or not here, basically.",
      "Do you want this extended?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.",
      "Just as I have been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people, when we're looking what's happening with WIC.",
      "There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on this C.R. and open the government back up.",
      "We have also given alternatives like end government shutdown. And I think you will see this week, if the Democrats don't come to the table, saying, look, a Shutdown Fairness Act, making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because, Margaret, these have real consequences for American people.",
      "And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible.",
      "They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, and I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010.",
      "This is the Affordable Air \u2013 Affordable Care Act that even \"The Washington Post\" has said was never really affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: You go to 2014, and what you see there though was increases made by the Democrats.",
      "And then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4 percent of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem.",
      "And so, when you think about this, you have got the 2021 premiums that they have given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases? We have got to be more \u2013 more responsible with taxpayer dollars.",
      "And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.",
      "Those two things do not match up. And Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open. And we're happy to have conversations, as we have always said, just as Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week.",
      "He credited you with announcing \u2013 well, basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a bad decision, and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time.",
      "With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership.",
      "From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family.",
      "And because of infertility, here in the United States, we have seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We have got about 9 percent of men, 11 percent of women who are facing these challenges.",
      "President Trump believes in being obviously the president that is helping hardworking Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that, which is so exciting. And we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater scale.",
      "And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And, additionally, we're going to drive the costs down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so I talked this weekend actually with a friend of mine who came up to me and said, \"I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this,\" because the affordability issue was the impediment.",
      "And she actually had to go off \u2013 off \u2013 off \u2013 over shores\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. So it's exciting for people like her.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And I have had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000, and lower-income women obviously have a challenge with that.",
      "But, during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it, or is it too controversial for conservatives, who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, Margaret, first, I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken. And that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you have seen the increases that people will see in 2026, 80 percent of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act-related.",
      "And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so we have got to be super honest about that.",
      "We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and actually support hardworking families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want to legislate, though, to force it to be?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, and what we're doing too \u2013 what I want to do is, I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world, and that's exactly what this is doing.",
      "We will continue to work on this issue. We also want to support families as they have children and are able to \u2013 in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the childcare cost, just the affordability aspect.",
      "And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the childcare tax credits\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances and 40 in others.",
      "So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here, because we want people to start and grow their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really\u2026",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: That's what this is doing. This is just the start, and look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly, you have been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the president's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this.",
      "If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up, we wouldn't be in this war to start with. When you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelenskyy more times in his nine months in office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 than President Biden did his entire time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have support to bring it to the floor?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: So, these conversations help us to have resolution.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 well, the first lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, it's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",

      "We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.",
      "You said the economy is this transformation. S&P global forecasts, Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year with a lot of the costs passed along to consumers themselves.",
      "You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk, or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE (President, European Central Bank): I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe \u2013 I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13 percent. So, the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer, and one-third of the consumer.",
      "What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds born by two corporates essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on the squeeze of the margins. How long are they going to put up with the squeeze of the margin? To be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So, it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit to their own profits before passing it along?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are talks happening we understand between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on social media he's going to meet with China's vice premiere in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you are ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two.",
      "But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have very, very strong trading position on that front, and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side, the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lockstep with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat, and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see space (ph) on?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say. I'm just a central banker. But the \u2013 the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the \u2013 the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So, it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question what the dollar would still warrant its status at the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that \u2013 that the administration has to use.",
      "Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that, or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the \u2013 the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded. And future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of crypto is number one. When you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically in any situation the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are worried (ph) \u2013",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been is and will continue to be is eroding a bit.",
      "Now, in addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted, you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position. But it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the sterling pound, you know, way back after the \u2013 after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it, and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So, volatility, uncertainty to the extent it is fueled by the administration is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, quickly on Ukraine. President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So, if all those countries holding assets that have cash balances available as collaterals go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine, to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine, because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",

And so far, not one college has agreed to sign and at least six have rejected it.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Professor Hudson and Professor Turner, how do you all think your university is going to interpret that kind of guidance? Do you think, first of all, that that is happening on your campuses? And then, how is that supposed to be regulated with this federal mandate?",
      "MIKI TURNER (Professor, USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism: I am on a task force, a provost (ph) task for academic freedom. Academic freedom and freedom of speech are two different things. But what we're working toward is to, you know, find that common ground between academic freedom, what professors and students can or cannot do in the classroom. And I don't think that this initiative will happen at USC. I can't \u2013 I can't see a situation where we would want to limit what we say, how we say it, and what we do as a university.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, can you go back to this idea that is being introduced here, that in the view of the Trump administration, this is actually a problem that needs to be fixed, that there is belittling or violence against conservative ideas on university campuses.",
      "LEILA HUDSON (Professor, University of Arizona School of Middle Eastern and North Africa Studies): Well, I would push back against that. Again, as a public research university, we are an open marketplace, if you will, of ideas. So, you're going to hear all kinds of speech. We have institutional rules that prevent harassment and certainly violence.",
      "But in terms of trying to regulate the speech, that, indeed, will violate, not only the academic freedom that makes our universities great, but the constitutional rights of the university community.",
      "So, I think that, again, this will require a lot more discussion and, indeed, resistance. And I've been very heartened, both on our campus and across the country, to see people rising up against anything that would silence any voices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the specific accusation that there's a problem of, you know, belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas, do any of you object to trying to counter that, or is it that none of you believe that that's actually even a real problem?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: The University of Virginia has taken the ability of people to cordially or speak to each other with courtesy but differing opinions very seriously. And we have a number of initiatives on grounds to try to advance that. So, we definitely think it's something important and we want to make sure that those, you know, isn't happening on our campuses. I don't think it's happening to the extent that it gets reported.",
      "But the thing that's really important is that each university should determine how those are implemented on their universities, what their issues are and have the decentralized decision-making ability to decide whether their university has an issue and how to deal with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, you were talking about the open marketplace of ideas here. And that is referring to the language in the compact that talks about the need to foster \"a vibrant brant marketplace of ideas.\" But in these terms, it's suggesting that that doesn't exist. That the overwhelming, you know, persuasion of the professors on campus are liberal. That seems to be the accusation here. Do you deny that that is an issue?",
      "LEILA HUDSON: Well, I don't think it's an issue that the federal government needs to weigh in on or any other level of government. Indeed, we have traditions, we have understandings, we have an ironclad commitment to the principles of free speech that mean that any systematic or chronic silencing of any individual's voice or perspective would immediately be identified and rectified by more speech, not by government intervention. So, I'm very comfortable that we can continue to improve climate on campus. But the act of introducing government regulation into that absolutely undermines and sabotages that project.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, in terms of where the Trump administration's compact came from, there were a lot of influences. But one of them, according to the man himself, is billionaire Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management. And he said he helped write the compact because \"without government involvement, reform at universities will be difficult,\" he argues. He says there have been \"government mandates\" on things like \"diversity, on discrimination and student discipline,\" so why view these at any different?",
      "Why is he wrong?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: We were talking about academic freedom. And I think in our ability to search for the truth in research, we also have responsibilities in the classroom that are different than you would experience in a corporate setting. And so, I read the compact differently than he does. I think the thing that I struggle with the most about the compact is the idea that it rewards loyalty as opposed to focuses on advancement of the truth.",
      "As a cancer survivor, I want federal research funds to go to the universities and the professors who have the best ideas to cure cancer. That's the way to advance knowledge. And academics, that's really \u2013 we are truth seekers. The compact says, you know, truth seeking is a core foundation of institutions of higher education. And I completely agree with that portion of the compact, it's just the implementation of that truth seeking that I think we differ on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the \u2013 the compact says that if this proposal is not signed on to by the university, they may choose to \"forgo federal benefits.\" If you do sign on, there's a chance of increased funding and federal partnerships. So, it's not explicitly threatened, but it's strongly suggested that that would be the consequence. That's how \u2013 how your \u2013 how the university understands it?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: That's how I believe most faculty understand it that I have heard from.",
      "Something interesting is that, even faculty who have grants have reached out to me and said, you know, we \u2013 we want the grants to go to the places that have the best ideas. We don't want to have special treatment. Faculty are truth seekers. And so, we don't \u2013 we don't want special benefits. Even if that means that our university is not favored because others do sign on, we all want the best ideas to be advanced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the state government front, there's also pressure at - - in Virginia and in California. In Virginia, Democrats in the state Senate wrote, \"if UVA signs this thing, there will be significant consequences in future budget cycles. Out in California, Professor Turner, Governor Newsom vowed to cut off billions in state funding if anyone signs this thing. And the White House says that's like California\"endorsing discrimination, tuition hikes and confronting speech with violence.\" If you're between those two pressure points, what do you do?",
      "MIKI TURNER: That's \u2013 that's a great question because I really have complete empathy for our college presidents who have to deal with this situation right now because they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this political ping-pong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, on the pressure from the Democrats in the state of Virginia, is that helping or is that hurting?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Pressure from both sides definitely feel \u2013 definitely feels it.",
      "I think the difference between the pressure from the state level and the pressure from the federal level is the state funds that come from the university are the university's to determine how they use. The federal funds that we get are either for students for financial aid or are for specific grants. So, the threats to remove funding are a little bit different in that regard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Turner, one of the things that got a lot of attention from both parties during the campaign was also just the high cost of college and university tuition right now.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: USC is the highest tuition of any private university in this country. We were looking at it before. And I was floored. It cost $75,000 a year in tuition. It gets close to $99,000 a year, inclusive of expenses. There are a lot of parents who would hear, oh, a five-year freeze in tuition and be glad that it went into effect.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Exactly. And that's one of the components I'm in agreement with, about the freeze on tuition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also wants to cap the number of international students that you have, which would impact USC because you're above that 15 percent threshold.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does one premise fight the other? Can \u2013 can you bring the cost down if you cut out the university students who are paying full boat coming from overseas?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Not at all. Not at all. We would not be able to do that because, you know, they \u2013 they essentially come with cash in hand. And not only that, do they add to the financial pot, but they also add to the collective perspective. And so, we want those students there from every country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to bring up one of the things that was raised here, and that is, we know the Supreme Court struck down race-based admissions. One of the first points in this compact addresses the issue of preferential treatment, as they refer to it, based on identity. They list, sex, nationality, gender, religion, race or political views.",
      "Professor Turner, you work on recruitment, I understand. How does this impact recruiting students?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Yes. If that goes into effect, that's going to affect the way I do things. But I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact on the way USC really does things. You know, we actively recruit, you know, students from all walks of life, of all races. And I don't think that, you know, we should stop that because, again, you know, we're thinking about these students. And we're thinking about their growth and how they are going to go out into the world and change this world for the better. And to \u2013 in order to do that, they need to engage with different types of people with different cultures. And so, hopefully, you know, this won't have that impact on our school because, you know, if we can't \u2013 we really can't afford to have that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, the University of Virginia's president was forced to resign because of a Department of Justice investigation related to DEI commitments. Do you get any indication that the federal pressure on UVA is going to go away?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Two of our open investigations with the Department of Justice that related to admissions around DEI have been closed. So, that is good news. And those were closed based on information we provided that apparently satisfied the concerns about race being used in admission.",
      "I think this particular item of the compact would impact UVA. UVA has always had a very holistic approach to admissions. We find talent to be much broader than just test scores and grades.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since we spoke with the three professors, USC and the University of Virginia have rejected the compact. No word yet from the University of Arizona.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For the first time in decades, CBS News is no longer reporting from inside the Pentagon. Our reporters, alongside those from dozens of networks, newspapers and wire services emptied out their booths and workspaces this past week. The journalists exited rather than agree to a 21-page list of new restrictions which would prevent them from soliciting information that has not been pre-approved by the government.",
      "The Department of War, as the current administration calls it, has a $1 trillion budget and employed 3 million military and civilian employees. CBS will continue to report from outside the building, but journalists will no longer have the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the military that helps the public understand what U.S. troops are facing.",
      "Secretary Hegseth once promised the most transparent administration ever. But as one former defense official told us, \"The American people are going to know a lot less about what their Department of War is doing.\"",

      "\"Back then, you could have a simple question, but you couldn't get an easy answer,\" Tyson said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"Now, you can type anything into Google, into ChatGPT. If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems.",
    "story": [
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "\"Under item 1.05(c), the Department may grant a delay after finding that a disclosure required by Item 1.05 would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",
      "What's in the CISA emergency order",
      "CISA's order directed federal civilian executive branch agencies \u2014 which include the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission, among others \u2014 to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, which are application delivery and security services.",
      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested last weekend for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to \"eliminate\" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at an event in New York City on Monday.",
      "Jeffries spoke at the Economic Club of New York on Monday.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Moynihan is scheduled to make his first\u00a0court appearance\u00a0in the case on Thursday in Dutchess County, New York.",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",
      "Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon.",
      "The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.",
      "The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.",
      "Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons."

      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",

    "story": [
      "In footage shared widely on social media last week, federal immigration agents were seen breaking into Gloria Maga\u00f1a's home Portland, Oregon, even though the person they were looking for does not live there.",
      "The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Maga\u00f1a told CBS News.",
      "The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Maga\u00f1a, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.",
      "With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Maga\u00f1a's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.",
      "Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.",
      "\"Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,\" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.",
      "While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Maga\u00f1a's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Maga\u00f1a said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.",
      "ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Maga\u00f1a's son, Napoleon Maga\u00f1a, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.",
      "A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Maga\u00f1a's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.",
      "\"Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,\" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.",
      "As millions took to the streets over the weekend for \"No Kings\" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.",
      "\"They're not indiscriminate,\" he told CBS News. \"We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.\"",
      "Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.",
      "\"We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,\" he said. \"If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.\"",
      "Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.",
      "Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.",
      "On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.",
      "Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.",
      "\"We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,\" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. \"And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.\"",
      "\"ICE cannot come in here \u2026 This could be a standoff if that happens,\" he added.",
      "Knutson said he prays he never has to face that reality."

      "St. Johns, Michigan, is aware its surroundings are changing. In the city of roughly 8,000 people, golf carts motor side-by-side with everyday traffic. St. Johns started regulating them last month \u2014 one of hundreds of communities across the country \u2014 putting restrictions on which roads the carts can be driven on.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP \u00a0[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

      "Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer \u2014 an encouraging sign of progress \u2014 but one that does not signal the end of his treatment.",
      "A Biden spokeswoman confirmed to CBS News Monday that the former president, who turns 83 next month, finished several weeks of radiation therapy treatment Monday at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia. His office first announced Oct. 11 that the former president had been undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer for several weeks.",
      "\"He rang the bell today,\" Biden spokeswoman Kelly Scully said.",
      "Ashley Biden, the daughter of the former president,\u00a0posted on Instagram\u00a0a quick video clip of her father ringing the bell, with the caption, \"Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!\"",
      "Subsequent photos posted by the one-time first daughter show the former president posing with a medical professional, and another with former first lady Jill Biden and two of their grandchildren with the caption, \"Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful.\"",
      "Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.",
      "Biden announced in May that he had an advanced stage of\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones, prompting an\u00a0outpouring of concern\u00a0and a new round of questions about his health and whether he faced undisclosed or unknown medical challenges during his presidency.",
      "According to a statement from his office in May, the former president was diagnosed with \"prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone\" after a small nodule was found in the prostate.",
      "Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment.",
      "Biden also\u00a0underwent a skin cancer surgery\u00a0in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area.",
      "The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House."

      "Nicholas Rossi, 38, was sentenced to five years in prison by District Judge Barry Lawrence in Salt Lake City, CBS affiliate KUTV reported.",
      "During the impact statement before Rossi was sentenced, the victim said Rossi left a \"trail of fear, pain and destruction\" behind him.",
      "\"This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,\" she told the court.",
      "Rossi \"uses rape to control women\" and posed a risk to community safety, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case.",
      "The sentence is the first of two scheduled for Rossi after he was convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 4 for the second conviction, also for five years to life in prison.",
      "In August, jurors found Rossi guilty of rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand. Rossi did not testify on his own behalf. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, Rossi maintained his innocence.",
      "\"I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,\" Rossi said softly, with a raspy voice.",
      "It took more than a decade from the time of the rapes to his convictions. Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit tied to the other case. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.",
      "He was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos \u2014 including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended \u2014 from an Interpol notice.",
      "He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.",
      "In his first Utah trial, Rossi's public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas.",
      "The victim had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.",
      "She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn't be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.",
      "She went to police years later after hearing Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.",
      "The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.",
      "Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008."

Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",

      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "summary": "Ian Cleary pleaded guilty to the attack that took place more than a decade ago while he was a student at Gettysburg College.",
    "story": [
      "A man who sent a Facebook message that said, \"So I raped you,\" to a woman he later\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to sexually assaulting on a Pennsylvania college campus was sentenced to two to four years in prison on Monday.",
      "The judge took into account Ian Cleary's guilty plea, his remorse and his long history of mental illness in giving a sentence below state guidelines. Cleary, 32, said he sent the messages as part of a 12-step program, in hopes of seeking atonement.",
      "However, victim Shannon Keeler told the court on Monday that the messages only reopened wounds she had long carried over the assault, which had gone years without being prosecuted.",
      "\"The system meant to protect me protected you instead,\" said Keeler, detailing in a powerful 10-minute impact statement the years she spent pursuing charges, which prosecutors are often reluctant to do in campus sexual assault cases.",
      "\"This isn't just my story, it's the story of countless women,\" she said.",
      "Cleary faced a maximum of 10 years in prison for the 2013 attack on Keeler at Gettysburg College, and the two sides had initially proposed a four- to eight-year sentence.",
      "\"The defendant has admitted his guilt, he's come forward and even though 10 to 11 alarming years have passed in the meantime, we wouldn't be here today but for his hope for some kind of forgiveness and contrition,\" said Senior Judge Kevin Hess, who nonetheless said that anyone with daughters or, like him, granddaughters in college would find the crime \"horrifying.\"",
      "According to Keeler, Cleary sneaked into her first-year dorm on the eve of winter break, when few people were left on campus, then pushed his way into her room and assaulted her.",
      "Cleary, who left Gettysburg after the attack, ultimately finished college in Silicon Valley, California, where he'd grown up. He then got a master's degree and worked for Tesla before moving overseas.",
      "Years later, he sent the Facebook message to Keeler, and she renewed her efforts with police and prosecutors to have charges filed. In 2021,\u00a0she shared her experience\u00a0in an Associated Press story on the reluctance of authorities to prosecute campus sex crimes.",
      "Cleary was indicted weeks later and, following a three-year search, was extradited from Metz, France, where he had been detained on unrelated charges in April 2024.",
      "Cleary, standing just a few feet away, apologized to Keeler in court on Monday, as well as to his family.",
      "\"I'm committed to getting treatment for mental health and stuff like that as I go forward,\" he said.",
      "Keeler, in\u00a0interviews\u00a0with the AP, described her decade-long effort to persuade authorities to pursue charges, starting hours after the assault.",
      "\"I had been thinking about this moment for 12 years,\" Keeler said after seeing Cleary in court in July when he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault. She called it a surreal moment.",
      "Authorities in the U.S. and Europe tried to\u00a0track Cleary down\u00a0after the indictment, but seemed unable to follow his trail, online or otherwise.",
      "In court in July, defense lawyer John Abom said Cleary was homeless at times and unaware of the charges. Adams County District Attorney Brian Sinnett said he had his doubts, but could prove that Cleary was on the run.",
      "Cleary's family members have declined to comment on the case and did not attend most of his court hearings. His father was present at Monday's sentencing, however.",
      "The AP typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Keeler has done."

      "With Halloween falling on a Friday this year, celebrations are expected to be bigger. Consumers are opening their wallets for everything spooky, from candy to costumes, despite paying higher prices for many items.",
      "U.S. consumers are expected to spend a record $13.1 billion this Halloween, up from $11.6 billion last year, according to the National Retail Federation. That breaks the previous record of $12.2 billion set in 2023. On average, Americans will shell out $114.45 per person, nearly $11 more than last year.",
      "The Hershey Co., which makes Halloween favorites including Hershey bars, Kit Kat bars and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, told CBS News there was \"no impact on Halloween candy prices this season.\" But prices at the register are telling a different story. According to CBS, a box of 48 full-size chocolate bars has jumped from $40 to more than $50.",
      "Cocoa prices have more than doubled since early 2024, according to the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute's latest analysis. Extreme weather in West Africa, which supplies 70% of the world's cocoa, has slashed yields, with heavy rains, crop disease and droughts causing the biggest supply deficit in more than 60 years.",

      "Price-conscious shoppers have some options other than chocolate treats this year, Stew Leonard Jr., the president and CEO of Stew Leonard's, a family-owned grocery chain in the Northeast, told CBS News. He recommended gummy bears and Starbursts instead.",
      "\"They are about 18 cents. So almost half the price [of a mini chocolate bar],\" he said.",
      "Alcohol prices may also hit consumers' wallets, given a 15% tariff on imported spirits. That could encourage shoppers to turn to domestically produced wines, beers and spirits.",
      "Nearly 90% of Halloween products, such as costumes and decorations, contain at least one component made overseas \u2014 most often in China \u2014 according to the Halloween and Costume Association. These products are vulnerable to supply chain issues and a 30% tariff rate on Chinese imports.",
      "Consumers are expected to spend an average of $37.62 on a single Halloween costume this year, an 11% increase from 2024, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "DIY Halloween",
      "Despite the higher costs, most U.S. adults still plan to celebrate Halloween, but some consumers are turning to budget-friendly techniques to rein\u00a0in spending.",
      "A report from Nielsen IQ shows that Gen Z consumers are embracing budget-friendly, reusable and DIY d\u00e9cor, often inspired by social media and driven by a focus on sustainability.",
      "Millennials are combining new purchases with reused items, while baby boomers and Gen Xers are more likely to scale back spending but still participate in Halloween traditions, Nielsen found. In fact, 55% of Millennials and 42% of Gen Z say they'll prioritize DIY or reused d\u00e9cor this year.",
      "Shopping early to avoid last-minute price hikes, choosing generic candy instead of big name brands and buying in bulk can also help save money, experts say."

    "summary": "A new study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased more than 50% over the last 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "And I think it's important for people to recognize Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. He is a master manipulator. The president has one view. Then he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he changes his story on this. Of course Putin does not want Ukraine to get\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 a longer-range missile that could go after targets deep into Russia, beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, by the way. It can range targets much further. It's very accurate. It's a very survivable weapon.",
      "And Putin has a conversation with him and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle \u2013 if we can give them enough rounds, if we have them in our inventory and enough launchers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Ground launchers are rather new to the system, something we got rid of for a long period of time.",
      "They have demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this, and it would help.",

      "I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican leader, John Thune, has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media.",
      "Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations on how to fix\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this enough?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 how to \u2013 I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium.",
      "They're going to go up on November 1 for people. They can't afford it. People in my state\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Either way, they're going up .",

      "This woman Emily (sp?), whose husband's a pastor, who has three kids, says, without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when premiums go up?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I would like to. I would like to \u2013 we should \u2013 we could \u2013 we should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us.",
      "The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress.",

      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT (R-Alabama): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things, but let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown.",
      "He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week. Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up, whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for or not here, basically.",
      "Do you want this extended?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.",
      "Just as I have been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people, when we're looking what's happening with WIC.",
      "There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on this C.R. and open the government back up.",
      "We have also given alternatives like end government shutdown. And I think you will see this week, if the Democrats don't come to the table, saying, look, a Shutdown Fairness Act, making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because, Margaret, these have real consequences for American people.",
      "And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible.",
      "They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, and I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010.",
      "This is the Affordable Air \u2013 Affordable Care Act that even \"The Washington Post\" has said was never really affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: You go to 2014, and what you see there though was increases made by the Democrats.",
      "And then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4 percent of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem.",
      "And so, when you think about this, you have got the 2021 premiums that they have given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases? We have got to be more \u2013 more responsible with taxpayer dollars.",
      "And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.",
      "Those two things do not match up. And Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open. And we're happy to have conversations, as we have always said, just as Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week.",
      "He credited you with announcing \u2013 well, basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a bad decision, and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time.",
      "With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership.",
      "From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family.",
      "And because of infertility, here in the United States, we have seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We have got about 9 percent of men, 11 percent of women who are facing these challenges.",
      "President Trump believes in being obviously the president that is helping hardworking Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that, which is so exciting. And we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater scale.",
      "And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And, additionally, we're going to drive the costs down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so I talked this weekend actually with a friend of mine who came up to me and said, \"I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this,\" because the affordability issue was the impediment.",
      "And she actually had to go off \u2013 off \u2013 off \u2013 over shores\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. So it's exciting for people like her.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And I have had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000, and lower-income women obviously have a challenge with that.",
      "But, during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it, or is it too controversial for conservatives, who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, Margaret, first, I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken. And that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you have seen the increases that people will see in 2026, 80 percent of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act-related.",
      "And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so we have got to be super honest about that.",
      "We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and actually support hardworking families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want to legislate, though, to force it to be?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, and what we're doing too \u2013 what I want to do is, I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world, and that's exactly what this is doing.",
      "We will continue to work on this issue. We also want to support families as they have children and are able to \u2013 in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the childcare cost, just the affordability aspect.",
      "And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the childcare tax credits\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances and 40 in others.",
      "So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here, because we want people to start and grow their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really\u2026",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: That's what this is doing. This is just the start, and look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly, you have been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the president's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this.",
      "If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up, we wouldn't be in this war to start with. When you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelenskyy more times in his nine months in office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 than President Biden did his entire time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have support to bring it to the floor?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: So, these conversations help us to have resolution.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 well, the first lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, it's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",

      "We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.",
      "You said the economy is this transformation. S&P global forecasts, Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year with a lot of the costs passed along to consumers themselves.",
      "You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk, or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE (President, European Central Bank): I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe \u2013 I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13 percent. So, the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer, and one-third of the consumer.",
      "What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds born by two corporates essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on the squeeze of the margins. How long are they going to put up with the squeeze of the margin? To be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So, it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit to their own profits before passing it along?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are talks happening we understand between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on social media he's going to meet with China's vice premiere in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you are ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two.",
      "But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have very, very strong trading position on that front, and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side, the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lockstep with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat, and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see space (ph) on?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say. I'm just a central banker. But the \u2013 the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the \u2013 the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So, it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question what the dollar would still warrant its status at the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that \u2013 that the administration has to use.",
      "Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that, or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the \u2013 the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded. And future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of crypto is number one. When you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically in any situation the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are worried (ph) \u2013",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been is and will continue to be is eroding a bit.",
      "Now, in addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted, you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position. But it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the sterling pound, you know, way back after the \u2013 after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it, and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So, volatility, uncertainty to the extent it is fueled by the administration is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, quickly on Ukraine. President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So, if all those countries holding assets that have cash balances available as collaterals go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine, to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine, because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",

And so far, not one college has agreed to sign and at least six have rejected it.",

      "JERI SEIDMAN (Professor, University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce): So, belittling speech is obviously not something that any university would want. However, as a state university, we are required to abide by the Constitution. And so, while a private university could decide to limit the free speech of faculty, staff or students if that university decided to, as a state institution, nobody can require the University of Virginia to limit the free speech or any other constitutional right of faculty, staff or students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Professor Hudson and Professor Turner, how do you all think your university is going to interpret that kind of guidance? Do you think, first of all, that that is happening on your campuses? And then, how is that supposed to be regulated with this federal mandate?",
      "MIKI TURNER (Professor, USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism: I am on a task force, a provost (ph) task for academic freedom. Academic freedom and freedom of speech are two different things. But what we're working toward is to, you know, find that common ground between academic freedom, what professors and students can or cannot do in the classroom. And I don't think that this initiative will happen at USC. I can't \u2013 I can't see a situation where we would want to limit what we say, how we say it, and what we do as a university.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, can you go back to this idea that is being introduced here, that in the view of the Trump administration, this is actually a problem that needs to be fixed, that there is belittling or violence against conservative ideas on university campuses.",
      "LEILA HUDSON (Professor, University of Arizona School of Middle Eastern and North Africa Studies): Well, I would push back against that. Again, as a public research university, we are an open marketplace, if you will, of ideas. So, you're going to hear all kinds of speech. We have institutional rules that prevent harassment and certainly violence.",
      "But in terms of trying to regulate the speech, that, indeed, will violate, not only the academic freedom that makes our universities great, but the constitutional rights of the university community.",
      "So, I think that, again, this will require a lot more discussion and, indeed, resistance. And I've been very heartened, both on our campus and across the country, to see people rising up against anything that would silence any voices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the specific accusation that there's a problem of, you know, belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas, do any of you object to trying to counter that, or is it that none of you believe that that's actually even a real problem?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: The University of Virginia has taken the ability of people to cordially or speak to each other with courtesy but differing opinions very seriously. And we have a number of initiatives on grounds to try to advance that. So, we definitely think it's something important and we want to make sure that those, you know, isn't happening on our campuses. I don't think it's happening to the extent that it gets reported.",
      "But the thing that's really important is that each university should determine how those are implemented on their universities, what their issues are and have the decentralized decision-making ability to decide whether their university has an issue and how to deal with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, you were talking about the open marketplace of ideas here. And that is referring to the language in the compact that talks about the need to foster \"a vibrant brant marketplace of ideas.\" But in these terms, it's suggesting that that doesn't exist. That the overwhelming, you know, persuasion of the professors on campus are liberal. That seems to be the accusation here. Do you deny that that is an issue?",
      "LEILA HUDSON: Well, I don't think it's an issue that the federal government needs to weigh in on or any other level of government. Indeed, we have traditions, we have understandings, we have an ironclad commitment to the principles of free speech that mean that any systematic or chronic silencing of any individual's voice or perspective would immediately be identified and rectified by more speech, not by government intervention. So, I'm very comfortable that we can continue to improve climate on campus. But the act of introducing government regulation into that absolutely undermines and sabotages that project.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, in terms of where the Trump administration's compact came from, there were a lot of influences. But one of them, according to the man himself, is billionaire Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management. And he said he helped write the compact because \"without government involvement, reform at universities will be difficult,\" he argues. He says there have been \"government mandates\" on things like \"diversity, on discrimination and student discipline,\" so why view these at any different?",
      "Why is he wrong?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: We were talking about academic freedom. And I think in our ability to search for the truth in research, we also have responsibilities in the classroom that are different than you would experience in a corporate setting. And so, I read the compact differently than he does. I think the thing that I struggle with the most about the compact is the idea that it rewards loyalty as opposed to focuses on advancement of the truth.",
      "As a cancer survivor, I want federal research funds to go to the universities and the professors who have the best ideas to cure cancer. That's the way to advance knowledge. And academics, that's really \u2013 we are truth seekers. The compact says, you know, truth seeking is a core foundation of institutions of higher education. And I completely agree with that portion of the compact, it's just the implementation of that truth seeking that I think we differ on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the \u2013 the compact says that if this proposal is not signed on to by the university, they may choose to \"forgo federal benefits.\" If you do sign on, there's a chance of increased funding and federal partnerships. So, it's not explicitly threatened, but it's strongly suggested that that would be the consequence. That's how \u2013 how your \u2013 how the university understands it?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: That's how I believe most faculty understand it that I have heard from.",
      "Something interesting is that, even faculty who have grants have reached out to me and said, you know, we \u2013 we want the grants to go to the places that have the best ideas. We don't want to have special treatment. Faculty are truth seekers. And so, we don't \u2013 we don't want special benefits. Even if that means that our university is not favored because others do sign on, we all want the best ideas to be advanced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the state government front, there's also pressure at - - in Virginia and in California. In Virginia, Democrats in the state Senate wrote, \"if UVA signs this thing, there will be significant consequences in future budget cycles. Out in California, Professor Turner, Governor Newsom vowed to cut off billions in state funding if anyone signs this thing. And the White House says that's like California\"endorsing discrimination, tuition hikes and confronting speech with violence.\" If you're between those two pressure points, what do you do?",
      "MIKI TURNER: That's \u2013 that's a great question because I really have complete empathy for our college presidents who have to deal with this situation right now because they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this political ping-pong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, on the pressure from the Democrats in the state of Virginia, is that helping or is that hurting?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Pressure from both sides definitely feel \u2013 definitely feels it.",
      "I think the difference between the pressure from the state level and the pressure from the federal level is the state funds that come from the university are the university's to determine how they use. The federal funds that we get are either for students for financial aid or are for specific grants. So, the threats to remove funding are a little bit different in that regard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Turner, one of the things that got a lot of attention from both parties during the campaign was also just the high cost of college and university tuition right now.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: USC is the highest tuition of any private university in this country. We were looking at it before. And I was floored. It cost $75,000 a year in tuition. It gets close to $99,000 a year, inclusive of expenses. There are a lot of parents who would hear, oh, a five-year freeze in tuition and be glad that it went into effect.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Exactly. And that's one of the components I'm in agreement with, about the freeze on tuition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also wants to cap the number of international students that you have, which would impact USC because you're above that 15 percent threshold.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does one premise fight the other? Can \u2013 can you bring the cost down if you cut out the university students who are paying full boat coming from overseas?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Not at all. Not at all. We would not be able to do that because, you know, they \u2013 they essentially come with cash in hand. And not only that, do they add to the financial pot, but they also add to the collective perspective. And so, we want those students there from every country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to bring up one of the things that was raised here, and that is, we know the Supreme Court struck down race-based admissions. One of the first points in this compact addresses the issue of preferential treatment, as they refer to it, based on identity. They list, sex, nationality, gender, religion, race or political views.",
      "Professor Turner, you work on recruitment, I understand. How does this impact recruiting students?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Yes. If that goes into effect, that's going to affect the way I do things. But I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact on the way USC really does things. You know, we actively recruit, you know, students from all walks of life, of all races. And I don't think that, you know, we should stop that because, again, you know, we're thinking about these students. And we're thinking about their growth and how they are going to go out into the world and change this world for the better. And to \u2013 in order to do that, they need to engage with different types of people with different cultures. And so, hopefully, you know, this won't have that impact on our school because, you know, if we can't \u2013 we really can't afford to have that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, the University of Virginia's president was forced to resign because of a Department of Justice investigation related to DEI commitments. Do you get any indication that the federal pressure on UVA is going to go away?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Two of our open investigations with the Department of Justice that related to admissions around DEI have been closed. So, that is good news. And those were closed based on information we provided that apparently satisfied the concerns about race being used in admission.",
      "I think this particular item of the compact would impact UVA. UVA has always had a very holistic approach to admissions. We find talent to be much broader than just test scores and grades.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since we spoke with the three professors, USC and the University of Virginia have rejected the compact. No word yet from the University of Arizona.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For the first time in decades, CBS News is no longer reporting from inside the Pentagon. Our reporters, alongside those from dozens of networks, newspapers and wire services emptied out their booths and workspaces this past week. The journalists exited rather than agree to a 21-page list of new restrictions which would prevent them from soliciting information that has not been pre-approved by the government.",

      "In several interviews with Mexico's Radio Formula in late September and earlier this month, Bravo denounced \"organized crime's permanent commercial hijacking of any commercial activity.\" He said criminals' demands had become out of reach for producers who were left with no other choice but to negotiate with them.",
      "He conceded that the federal government had made some advances against organized crime in the area, but said more had to be done to end their impunity.",
      "Last year, the federal government sent hundreds of troops to Michoacan to protect lime growers complaining of extortion threats.",

      "Ordinary citizens are also targeted with extortion.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",

      "The White House said Australia is also making new defense investments, including the purchase of $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles. Since February, the White House said Australia has contributed $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base. A trilateral security partnership called AUKUS involving the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which was first struck during the Biden administration \u2014 aims to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, and producing submarines for that region is a key part of that security alliance.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Sumo's biggest international showcase in history rocked London this week, spotlighting more than 40 wrestlers across 100 bouts with blistering palm thrusts, stunning face slaps and an unforgettable lightning-fast overarm throw. The final championship clash of the Grand Sumo Tournament was a battle of giants \u2014 a Goliath versus only a slightly smaller Goliath.",
      "Colliding with the force of a few tons and sending clay into the air, 330-pound Hoshoryu Tomokatsu seized the blue silk belt \u2014 the mawashi \u2014 of 420-pound Onosato Daiki. Momentum carried the heavier man to the edge of the ring, then Hoshoryu powered him out, sealing a perfect 5-0 record in just 10 seconds. The 5,000-strong crowd inside London's sold-out Royal Albert Hall erupted in cheers.",
      "\"I'm just glad to have got through the five days with no injuries,\" Hoshoryu said backstage after claiming the championship trophy.",
      "He hadn't planned a celebration, but told CBS News he's ready to go where his career takes him.",
      "\"If someone decides that we'll do this in America, of course I'll be there,\" said the 26-year-old.",
      "For young American boys watching and dreaming of entering sumo's sacred ring, his advice was rooted in self-discipline and perseverance.",
      "\"You must work hard to be a sumo wrestler if that is your dream. Everyone has dreams \u2014 but only you can achieve them,\" he said.",
      "Sumo is a life of devotion. Wrestlers typically begin training around age 15, the minimum age to join a heya, or stable, where they live communally and train full-time under a stablemaster, a retired wrestler. To outsiders, sumo may look like a sport but for its practitioners, it is a way of life shaped by 1,500 years of ritual and discipline, rooted in Shinto prayers for a bountiful harvest.",
      "London's Royal Albert Hall \u2014 better known for the echoes of The Beatles, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruce Springsteen than the slaps and grunts of massive muscle men \u2014 was transformed into a place of reverence to reflect that.",
      "\"I've worked here 11 years, and this is one of the most exciting weeks I've ever been part of,\" said David Gamble, head of programming at the hall, who gave CBS News a special, behind-the-scenes tour.",
      "\"We've had teams, artisans in the U.K. create this 1.5 ton roof,\" he said, gesturing to the massive hanging roof over the ring reminiscent of a Shinto shrine. \"It is more than sport \u2026 we had a ring blessing ceremony where the Sumo Association blessed the ring in the same way that they would for all of their shows in Tokyo.\"",
      "He explained the few rows of red floor mats circling the ring were the most coveted \u2014 and the riskiest.",
      "\"You're really going to have to stay focused because at any moment there might be a 400 pound sumo wrestler bearing down on you, so no time to check your phone,\" Gamble said with a grin. These seats are \"the most expensive, the best and the most dangerous.\"",
      "Big wrestlers meant big logistics. The venue brought in 10 tons of clay to build the sacred ring \u2014 the dohy\u014d \u2014 and had to procure nearly a ton of rice. The athletes consume up to 10,000 calories a day, mostly in the form of a protein-rich stew, called chanko-nabe.",
      "The heaviest sumo wrestler ever recorded remains Konishiki Yasokichi, the Hawaiian-American who weighed 633 pounds at his peak. He competed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, when sumo first ventured beyond Japan's shores \u2014 the last time the hall hosted the sport until now.",
      "This week's event marked sumo's first overseas tournament in 34 years, and only its second in history. The more than 40 \"rishiki\" \u2014 not all from Japan but Mongolia and Ukraine too \u2014 stopped a lot of people in their tracks outside Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, crossing Abbey Road like The Beatles and at the \"Harry Potter\" Platform 9 3/4 attraction at King's Cross station.",
      "As Hoshoryu raised his championship trophy \u2014 the ornate Emperor's Cup, flown in from Tokyo \u2014 the moment symbolized more than victory. It was a celebration of an ancient Japanese tradition finding new life \u2014 and new fans \u2014 far from home."

      "\"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia \u2014 the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing,\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0a social media post.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.",
      "\"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions,\" he said in a\u00a0social media post. \"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.\"",
      "In\u00a0another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a \"pointed conversation.\"",
      "The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump \"cursing all the time.\" Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was \"sick\" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters on Sunday, in remarks that were embargoed until Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine shared \"President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end  of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours  with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive \u2014 that we  stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides  understand what is meant.\"",
      "\"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's\u00a0incredibly tense encounter\u00a0in front of television cameras in February.",
      "The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that\u00a0Zelenskyy had hoped Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in\u00a0a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants.",

      "Despite positive signals from the White House in recent months regarding a potential deal to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, Mr. Trump demurred on the subject when asked about it by reporters Friday during his meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "\"One thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks, also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday that Mr. Trump had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant Ukraine access to the missiles.",
      "\"If he thinks it is in America's best interest to sell additional weapons to Europe, he will do that, but right now he has not made that decision with regards to Tomahawks,\" Vance said."

    "summary": "An Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory is halted \"until further notice,\" the first major test of the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Gaza's fragile ceasefire faced its first major test Sunday as Israeli forces launched a wave of deadly strikes, saying Hamas militants had killed two soldiers, and an Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory was halted.",
      "The military later said it resumed enforcing the ceasefire, and the official confirmed to The Associated Press that aid deliveries would resume Monday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Israel's military said it hit multiple targets in the Gaza Strip using aircraft and artillery, after it accused Hamas of shooting at Israeli soldiers. Military officials later said two soldiers were killed.",
      "An Israeli military official told CBS News that Hamas had targeted its soldiers with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire.",
      "\"Both of the incidents happened in an Israeli-controlled area, east of the yellow line,\" the official said. \"This is a bold violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Israel's security heads and his office said in a statement that he had directed the military to take \"strong action\" against what he called \"terrorist targets.\" He did not threaten to return to war.",
      "Hamas said that it was not involved in any of the clashes that had been reported earlier in Rafah in southern Gaza.",
      "\"We reaffirm our full commitment to implement everything that was agreed upon, foremost of which is a ceasefire across all areas of the Gaza Strip,\" the group's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement. \"We have no knowledge of any incidents or clashes taking place in the Rafah area, as these are red zones under the occupation's control, and contact with the remaining groups of ours there has been cut off since the war resumed in March of this year.\"",
      "Hospital sources in Gaza told CBS News that at least 38 people have been killed in the territory since Sunday morning.",
      "Israel's military said it had struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets.",
      "Later on Sunday, Israel's military said that \"in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,\" it had begun \"re-enforcing the ceasefire following its violation by the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"The IDF will continue to enforce the ceasefire agreement and will respond forcefully to any violation of the agreement,\" the Israeli military said in a statement.",
      "Later Sunday night, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the ceasefire was still in effect, and blamed \"some rebels within\" Gaza, rather than Hamas itself, for the alleged breaches.",
      "\"But either way, it's going to be handled properly. It's going to be handled toughly, but properly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The strikes came as Israel\u00a0identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight, and the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed \"until further notice.\" The statement from Netanyahu's office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its obligation under the ceasefire deal to return the remains of all the deceased hostages. The bodies of 16 hostages, two of them foreign nationals, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli media.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. State Department\u00a0warned that it had received \"credible reports\"\u00a0indicating that Hamas may be planning an attack on \"Palestinian civilians\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The State Department did not provide any details on the timing or location of the possible attack, saying only that it \"would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts.\"",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died.",
      "The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza and future governance of the devastated territory."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel on Friday, killing three people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Sunday. It is the seventh known attack since last month.",
      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",
      "The defense secretary said the strike took place in international waters and within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

      "Thieves carried out a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning, breaking into the famed landmark using a basket lift to force open a window, smash display cases and steal jewelry that has \"inestimable value,\" France's interior minister and the museum said.",
      "The break-in happened in broad daylight while tourists were already inside the Louvre, the world's most visited museum. It was forced to close in the aftermath of the incident as authorities began to investigate. Police sealed the museum gates and visitors were ushered out. No injuries were reported, according to spokespeople for the Louvre.",
      "\"A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,\" French Culture Minister Rachida Dati wrote on X, while the museum cited \"exceptional reasons\" for the closure.",
      "Dati called the strike the work of \"professionals,\" describing it on TF1 TV network as \"a four-minute operation carried out without violence.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez previously told France Inter radio that the heist took seven minutes and the thieves used a disc cutter to slice through the panes. He said it was \"manifestly a team that had done scouting.\"",
      "The heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m., when several people broke into the Louvre through the Galerie d'Apollon and stole jewelry before fleeing the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"An investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled,\" the statement said. \"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value.\"",
      "France's ministers of culture and interior were at the Louvre and working with the museum's management as well as law enforcement, the statement continued, adding that \"all possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.\"",
      "The interior ministry similarly said that forensic work was underway Sunday morning and a precise inventory of the stolen items was being compiled.",
      "Video from the scene showed confused tourists being ushered out of the glass pyramid and surrounding courtyards as officers shut the iron gates and closed nearby streets along the Seine.",
      "The Galerie d'Apollon is a vaulted hall in the Denon wing that displays part of the French Crown Jewels beneath a ceiling painted by King Louis XIV's court artist, according to the ministry.",
      "French daily Le Parisien reported the thieves entered via the Seine-facing facade, where construction is underway, and used a freight elevator to reach the gallery. After breaking windows, they reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. One stolen jewel was later found outside the museum, the paper reported, adding that the item was believed to be Empress Eug\u00e9nie's crown and that it had been broken.",
      "Security around the marquee works remains tight. The Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass and a custom high-tech display system as part of broader anti-theft measures across the museum.",
      "Staffing and protection have been flashpoints at the Louvre. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions have warned that mass tourism strains security and visitor management.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday's theft.",
      "In January, President Emmanuel Macron announced a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan \u2014 roughly \u20ac700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece its own dedicated gallery by 2031 \u2014 but workers say relief has been slow to reach the floor.",
      "The theft, less than half an hour after doors opened, echoes other recent European museum raids.",
      "In 2019, thieves smashed vitrines in Dresden's Green Vault and carried off diamond-studded royal jewels worth hundreds of millions of euros. In 2017, burglars at Berlin's Bode Museum stole a 100-kilogram (220-pound) solid-gold coin. In 2010, a lone intruder slipped into Paris's Museum of Modern Art and escaped with five paintings, including a Picasso.",
      "The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence \u2014 an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci's portrait the world's best-known artwork.",
      "Home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting \u2014 from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters \u2014 the Louvre's star attractions include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The museum can draw up to 30,000 visitors a day."

      "Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",
      "The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his demotion when it emerged that he had emailed Epstein 12 weeks later.

      "This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).",
      "Prince Andrew is facing another wave of humiliation due to his accuser Virginia Giuffre's upcoming posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",
      "In the bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "In addition to her explosive allegations, Giuffre made scathing remarks about Andrew's disastrous 2019 BBC \"Newsnight\" interview, reviving the conversation around the TV appearance that triggered the downfall of his public life.",
      "\"He said he had no recollection of ever meeting me\u2014\u2018None whatsoever.\u2019 Most outlandishly, he said he couldn\u2019t have danced sweatily with me at the Tramp nightclub, as I\u2019d described, because he\u2019d temporarily developed an inability to perspire after enduring \u2018an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War,'\u2014a bizarre reference to his military service nineteen years prior to our meeting,\" she wrote in a copy of the book, obtained by Fox News Digital.",
      "Prince Andrew is facing humiliation again as his late accuser Virginia Giuffre's memoir puts the spotlight back on his disastrous 2019 interview.\u00a0 (Karwai Tang/WireImage; Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Andrew's interview centered on his friendship with convicted sex-offender Epstein and Giuffre's allegations that he had sex with her when she was underage. The royal agreed to the interview in order to clear his name and explain his relationship with Epstein.",
      "Instead, the interview became infamous due to Andrew\u2019s defensive and tone-deaf answers. After it aired on Nov. 16, 2019, the response was overwhelmingly negative.",
      "The interview was branded a \"car crash\" and a PR disaster, with widespread disbelief at Andrew\u2019s explanations and criticism of his lack of empathy along with other odd moments, including the references to not sweating.",
      "Media, politicians and the public widely viewed it as catastrophic for both his personal reputation and the monarchy\u2019s image. Within days, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would step back from public duties \"for the foreseeable future.\" He later lost his military titles and royal patronages, and corporate sponsors and charities cut ties with him and his initiatives.",
      "Meanwhile, Giuffre wrote, \"as devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, detailed her alleged sexual encounters with Andrew in her posthumous memoir.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, royal expert Hilary Fordwich weighed in on the fallout from the book.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "\"In addition to all we know, [Andrew] comes across even worse as unrepentant and manipulative. This is ghastly for the royal family,\" she said.",
      "\"The orgy with eight others is revolting,\" Fordwich continued. \"Her quote that he was having sex with her if having sex with me was his birthright is damning and all the cover-up attempts, which demonstrate deliberate actions and contradict his Newsnight interview where he stated he didn\u2019t even know Giuffre. If he didn\u2019t know her, then why was he trying to cover up?\"",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Andrew allegedly appears in this photograph with his arm around the waist of then-17-year-old Giuffre. Ghislaine Maxwell is standing to the right. (U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals)",
      "Fordwich noted that, \"Andrew\u2019s team attempting to hire online trolls in order to harass her so as to cast doubt regarding her credibility during her U.S. lawsuit in a smear campaign, which is now being investigated by British police is also horrendous. It indicates such hubris, moral blindness and entitlement.\"",
      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams explained that Giuffre's depiction of Andrew in the memoir and her revival of his 2019 interview could deepen the lasting damage to his reputation and future within the royal family.",
      "\"The portrait she paints of Andrew is of a bovine, entitled and supercilious individual, in some ways never out of the nursery,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If his Newsnight interview did not exist, no one would have been able to invent it outside a spoof,\" Fitzwilliams continued. \"Yet he was a brave pilot before he succumbed to the lure of disastrous friendships like that of the deceased pedophile Epstein.\"",
      "In August 2019, four months before Andrew's interview, Epstein died in prison while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss Giuffre's civil lawsuit, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital that Andrew could potentially face legal consequences over the claims made in Giuffre's book and the newly resurfaced emails.",
      "\"While past civil litigation in the U.S. is concluded, the new memoir revives several potential areas of concern for Andrew,\" she explained. \"Even though he has not (as of yet) been criminally charged, the renewed scrutiny over possible misuse of police resources or attempt to gather personal information on a survivor could trigger regulatory or investigative action.\"",
      "\"If the monarchy faces any renewed questions about oversight, privilege, and accountability, that action might even be greenlit by palace agents,\" Matta added.",
      "Andrew is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Sang Tan, File)",
      "In addition to the emails published by the Mail on Sunday, other leaked correspondence could prove to be a liability for Andrew, according to Fitzwilliams.",
      "On Oct. 12, The Guardian published details of an email dated Feb. 28, 2011 from Andrew to Epstein, which contradicted the royal\u2019s prior claim that he cut contact with the disgraced financier in 2010.",
      "\"I\u2019m just as concerned for you! Don\u2019t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it,\" he allegedly wrote in an email sent to Epstein. \"Otherwise keep in close touch and we\u2019ll play some more soon!!!!\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",
      "The leaked emails published by the Mail on Sunday emerged days after Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal titles and honors due to the accusations connecting him with Epstein.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew's statement read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.

      "\"No doubt the royals hoped that with Andrew voluntarily removing his titles that would be punishment enough, but more people are baying for blood with politicians seeking a legal resolve of title removals, Metropolitan police investigating the allegations of trying to use his security staff in establishing any scandals attached to Guiffre and the fact living in luxury in the 30 bedroom Royal Lodge at Windsor should still be allowed.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:51:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The 9th Circuit weighed Trump\u2019s plan to send Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, a test of presidential power likely headed to the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy discusses the legal challenges to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to American cities on 'The Sunday Briefing.'",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ruled that President Donald Trump can deploy Oregon National Guard troops into the city of Portland, delivering a significant victory to the Trump administration as it continues its effort to send federal forces into Democratic-led cities despite a string of recent setbacks in other district and appeals courts.",
      "Judges on the three-member panel ruled 2-1 to authorize Trump's deployment. Judge Ryan Nelson and Judge Bridget Bade, both appointed by Trump, sided with the administration in the majority ruling, with the lone Clinton-appointed judge, Susan Graber, dissented.",
      "\"After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12406(3), which authorizes the federalization of the National Guard when \u2018the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\u2019\" the majority said.",
      "The move has become a political flashpoint as protesters opposing his key policies have clashed with law enforcement. Oregon officials and civil liberties groups say the administration is exaggerating the threat, while Trump allies insist the Guard is needed to restore order.",

      "Federal agents attempt to keep protesters back outside an ICE facility on October 6, 2025, in Portland, Oregon.\u00a0 (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",
      "After a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump's attempt to deploy troops to Portland earlier this month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal.",
      "The lower court judge had described Trump's action in her emergency order as \"untethered to reality,\" and one that she said risks \"blurring the line between civil and military federal power \u2014 to the detriment of this nation.\"",
      "The appeals court quickly stayed the lower court\u2019s order pending review.",
      "The ruling comes as Trump has sought to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities despite stated opposition from local and state leaders. Senior administration officials have argued that the deployment is a necessary step to crack down on what they say is an uptick in violent crime and protect against threats from protesters, including anti-ICE demonstrations in many downtown areas.",
      "Democrats have countered that Trump's descriptions are hyperbolic and inaccurate, and are merely a legal pretext for Trump to try to \"federalize\" Democratic-led cities. They've used news conferences to highlight declines in violent crime, and have argued in court that the effort to deploy federal troops exceeds Trump's authority as commander-in-chief.",
      "Until the matter is appealed to the Supreme Court, the burden remains on the lower courts to navigate the high-profile, politically thorny flurry of cases.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)",
      "Another federal appeals court has also weighed in on the dispute. On Saturday, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago partially lifted a lower court order blocking Trump\u2019s federal deployment of National Guard troops, though the decision stopped short of authorizing their use and instead allowed them to remain at a U.S. Army Reserve base outside the city.",
      "In Oregon, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held about 90 minutes of arguments on the administration\u2019s appeal. Trump administration officials argued the troops' presence was necessary to quell mounting unrest and protect against future risk of violence.",
      "Judges on the three-member panel appeared largely sympathetic to the Trump administration, especially the two Trump appointees, who noted presidents do enjoy broad latitude to deploy the National Guard.",
      "\"It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don\u2019t have evidence of that,\" Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee, said during oral arguments.",
      "Trump's decision to call up the military \"doesn\u2019t strike me as a glaring overuse on its face,\" he said.",

      "The panel's majority otherwise did little to disguise their skepticism of arguments presented by Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin \u2014 including that Trump's assessment of violence in the city did not justify federalizing the National Guard.",
      "Chaffin argued that the protests in Portland are a far cry from a definition of a \"rebellion\" \u2014 one of two conditions Trump needs to meet the legal pretext for National Guard deployment.",
      "Rebellions \"are unusual and extreme emergencies,\" Chaffin said. She noted that the bulk of complaints by local agents are focused on them being short-staffed. Administrative or personnel concerns, she said, \"are not a reason to bring the military into the streets of Portland or any other U.S. city.\"",
      "Still, the court appeared poised to side with the Trump administration.",
      "\"I\u2019m not sure even President Lincoln would have been able to authorize the use of force right now\" if his actions were to be scrutinized under the \"much more stringent reviewability standard\" implied by Oregon here, Nelson noted shortly before court adjourned.",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "Hackers hit Discord\u2019s support vendor, exposing sensitive user data worldwide. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "What Discord is doing now and what users should do next",
      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts. We've secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.\"",

      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",

Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",

They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",

You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",

      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate. Using a personal data removal service helps wipe your private details from data broker sites, cutting off one of the main sources hackers use to impersonate you.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

    "story": [
      "AI-powered driving will help with a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs and relentless demand for faster deliveries.",
      "Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",
      "Right now, most resurfacing decisions are based on visible damage. But cracks and wear in the layers below the asphalt often go undetected until it's too late. That's where Fraunhofer's innovation comes in.",

      "How AI road sensors work to prevent costly repairs",
      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",
      "ULTRA-THIN SOUND BLOCKER CUTS TRAFFIC NOISE DRAMATICALLY",
      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",
      "For drivers, it means less time sitting in construction zones. For local governments, it means better roads built on data, not guesswork.",

These companies collect your personal details, such as age, phone number, donation history and even religious or political leanings, and sell them to anyone who asks. That means fraudsters can buy a ready-made list of \"generous retirees who donate to veterans' causes\" and start calling immediately.

They automatically reach out to data brokers on your behalf, demand the removal of your personal info and keep following up so it doesn't creep back online.",

      "Earlier this year, his office dropped an assault and kidnapping case against King when the victim failed to appear in court \u2014 a decision that allowed King to walk free on $200,000 bail, even though prosecutors had sought nearly $1 million because of the violent nature of the charges.",

      "Krasner countered that late-night bail appeals are often \"fruitless,\" adding, \"The unfortunate reality is that some judges don\u2019t want you calling them in the middle of the night. And if you do, they lower the bail \u2014 they don\u2019t raise it.\"",

      "During a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday, Trump warned, \"We're going to eradicate them. If we have to, they'll be eradicated. And they know that,\" he told reporters, and stressed the deal\u2019s broad backing \u2014 \"59 countries that agreed to the deal\" \u2014 while insisting the ceasefire remains in place and warning that any further violence would be met with decisive action.",

      "\"We don't need to, because we have many countries, as you know, signed on to this deal,\" he said. \"We've had countries calling me when they saw some of the killing with Hamas, saying we'd love to go in and take care of the situation ourselves. In addition,\u00a0you have Israel \u2014 they would go in, in two minutes. If I asked him to go in, I could tell him, go in and take care of it. But right now, we haven't said that. We're going to give it a little chance, and hopefully there will be a little less violence.\"",
      "He added a blunt warning about\u00a0Hamas' capacity and support. \"But right now, you know, they're violent people. Hamas has been very violent, but they don't have the backing of Iran anymore\u2026 They have to be good, and if they're not good, they'll be eradicated \u2014 because absolutely we can, and we have the capacity to do so.\"",
      "The comments came as senior U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli leaders to shore up the fragile, Trump-brokered, 20-step ceasefire plan after a weekend flare-up. Hamas terrorists killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli strikes against the terror group. Despite the violence, both Israel and Hamas publicly recommitted to the truce.",

But over decades, it has metastasized into a sweeping jurisdiction for granting children autonomy \u2013 and\u00a0secrecy \u2013 over their medical decisions.

      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",

    "story": [
      "Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an outspoken accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that her own father had abused her and suggested that he took hush money from Epstein in a posthumous memoir releasing Tuesday.",
      "Giuffre, 41, had been working on the book with a co-author before she died by suicide in April. In the memoir, she alleges that other men had abused her before she was groomed by Epstein at age 16.",
      "She alleges that her experience with abuse began as early as 7 by her father. Her father denied the allegation, insisting that he never abused his daughter. And in a statement in the memoir, her father said he \u201cnever knew what was going on with Epstein\u201d until he saw the news online.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s brother Sky Roberts Jr. told NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson that he confronted his father over the abuse allegation.",
      "\u201cI just, I said \u2014 we know,\u201d he recalled, choking up. \u201cI mean, you were Dad. You sexually abused your daughter. It\u2019s absolutely heinous what he did.\u201d",
      "Giuffre recounts in the memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\u201d that Epstein showed her a photo of her younger brother, then in middle school, and told her to keep quiet about \u201cwhat goes on in this house.\u201d She also suggested in her book that her father may have taken money from Epstein after he began abusing her.",
      "Her brother recalled that their father would buy \u201cdecently nice things\u201d at points in their life, including a boat.",
      "\u201cIf there was a payment wired to him, like it would, would be disgusting, be disgusting that he accepted money,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "The final years of Giuffre\u2019s life were marked by her repeatedly calling for criminal charges against Epstein and his associates. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence. Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against him in 2019, and he died while awaiting trial.",
      "Giuffre provided federal authorities with information that led to the arrest and conviction of his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre said she was getting her life back on track after a troubled childhood when she met Maxwell, who steered her into Epstein\u2019s path.",
      "She alleged that the two groomed her into becoming a sex slave for Epstein and that Epstein trafficked her to other prominent men in his circle. Maxwell, a former British socialite, was convicted on five counts of sex trafficking in 2021 for her role in recruiting young girls to be abused by Epstein.",
      "Other survivors have credited Giuffre\u2019s bravery for giving them the strength to come forward with their own allegations. When she died in April, Giuffre\u2019s attorney described her as \u201can incredible champion for other victims.\u201d",

      "The Toronto Blue Jays advanced to the World Series on Monday by defeating the Seattle Mariners and winning the American League pennant.",
      "The Blue Jays survived the American League Championship Series on their home field by taking a winner-take-all Game 7, 4-3, to make the franchise\u2019s first World Series berth since 1993 and set up a matchup against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "The pivotal moment came in the bottom of the seventh inning with Toronto trailing 3-1. With runners on second and third base with one out, George Springer crushed a sinker from Mariners pitcher Bryan Woo 381 feet to the left-center field stands for a lead that would not be relinquished.",
      "Because Toronto finished with a better regular-season record, it will have home-field advantage for the World Series, starting with hosting Game 1 on Friday and Game 2 on Saturday.",
      "The Dodgers won two of the three games the teams played this season in early August.",
      "\"It takes so much work and perseverance to get to this point, and I love this entire group,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said postgame. \"It's so fitting \u2014bottom of our order gets it done again. There's probably no other person on planet Earth that I want up other than George Springer and his October magic.\"",
      "Only eight players on Toronto\u2019s 40-man roster were alive when the team last made the World Series in 1993, when it won a second consecutive title. The championships were followed by 21 consecutive seasons without so much as a playoff berth.",
      "Including their postseason return in 2015, the club has made the playoffs five of the last 10 years but never broken through to win the pennant until this season, when it won 94 games \u2014 a 20-win improvement over 2024 \u2014 under manager John Schneider.",
      "They began the postseason by beating the New York Yankees in the divisional series, then opened the ALCS by immediately falling into an 0-2 hole. Wins in Seattle evened the series, as did another in Game 6, in which Toronto staved off elimination thanks to Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\u2019s sixth home run of the postseason, a franchise record.",
      "The Blue Jays are the first team since the 1996 Yankees to lose the first two games at home of a best-of-seven series, only to ultimately win the series."

      "If you have been scrolling on the social media platform lately, chances are, you have seen TikTok users posting videos and leaving comments about being in \u201cgroup 7\u201d without providing more context about the secret club. So who started the mysterious group and how can you score an invite?",
      "Well, it appears the origins of group 7 can be traced back to singer Sophia James. Last week, the music artist posted a series of videos on TikTok. In her first clip, she shared that she had recently received a parking ticket while dancing and singing along to her new song \u201cSo Unfair.\u201d James then continued to upload more clips with a goal: to get as many TikTok users as possible to see her posts and hear her song by flooding their feeds.",
      "By the fourth video, she started labeling the clips and the fans who came across them in groups.",

      "As the night went on, more videos arrived. The seventh and final video in her algorithm experiment went viral.",
      "\u201cIf you are watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James explained. \u201cI have posted seven videos tonight and this is the seventh one. Just a little science experiment to see what kind of video gets the most reach.\u201d",
      "She playfully added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about you, but you\u2019re in group 7!\u201d",
      "Beneath her post, which has 8.5 million views as of Oct. 20, TikTok users celebrated and joked about being in the special group.",
      "\u201cI (hereby) declare group 7 is the most elite group,\u201d one wrote in a comment.",

      "One TikTok user also used a post to explain how the joke went viral. In her video, the TikTok user complimented James for succeeding in getting millions of people to listen to and promote her new single.",
      "\u201cIt is incredible. I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in awhile. It\u2019s also immaculate marketing,\u201d the TikTok user said.",
      "She then pointed out that \u201cSo Unfair\u201d has taken off on the TikTok, with some asking for it to be group 7\u2019s \u201canthem.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone is using her song, and it is the best marketing technique I have ever seen a musician do,\u201d she praised. \u201cI think we all should really know the name Sophia James.\u201d"

      "\"Love Is Blind\" launched on Netflix in 2020, and has spawned multiple international versions, from France to Brazil. \"Married at First Sight\" was adapted from a Danish version of the show. It began in 2014 on FYI, later moving to Lifetime and, as of 2025, Peacock.",

      "Witherspoon, who runs her own book club and has served as executive producer of many book-to-screen adaptations, collaborated with bestselling thriller author Harlan Coben to write the novel \"Gone Before Goodbye,\" out Oct. 14.",
      "Witherspoon tells TODAY.com she came out of the experience with \"more respect for writers.\"",
      "\"It's just an incredibly disciplined talent where they have to really make stuff up out of thin air,\" Witherspoon says.",
      "Coben, standing next to her, says he's not sure where his ability to write his many twists comes from. \"I think if I think about it, it'll go away,\" he says, laughing.",
      "\"Gone Before Goodbye\" began with an idea Witherspoon had about three years ago, but felt she couldn't execute on her own. She called up Coben, whom she had met about two and half years before, to help tell the story of Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who finds herself entangled with billionaire oligarchs, dark money and a dangerous scheme.",
      "Growing up the daughter of a surgeon and nurse, Witherspoon was fascinated by the medical profession and said at her Shine Away in October that she once dreamed of entering the field, per the Hollywood Reporter.",
      "Writing a book marked a new chapter for Witherspoon \u2014 and a new one for Coben, who had never collaborated on a book before.",
      "They emailed, talked, texted or met every day, \u201cWe were both completely obsessed by this story,\u201d Coben says.",
      "Coben calls Witherspoon a \"generous collaborator\" and \"one of the great storytellers out there.\"",
      "\"Reese was just the perfect partner. She knew when to push me, when to back off, when to just \u2014 I could see why she'd be a great boss,\" he says, adding, \"I actually admire everything about Reese.\"",
      "Witherspoon, meanwhile, says it was \"privilege\" to watch him construct the book.",
      "\"I understood a lot as an actor about building character, but he builds entire worlds and a cast of characters that all have to intertwine to come out with this perfect result. And he managed to tie up every loose end, which I didn't think was possible,\" she says.",
      "But when it came to landing the ending, Coben credits Witherspoon's suggestion to change it.",
      "\"When she first told me, (I) was kind of like, 'No one touches my endings.' But actually she was right. I went to bed that night, I woke up the next morning, said, 'You're right.' So we made a little change in the end,\" he says.",
      "The duo played coy when asked on TODAY with Jenna & Friends whether they'd ever team up for an adaptation.",
      "As for whether Witherspoon would write another book?",
      "\"Only with Harlan Coben,\" she says."

      "Why are all the TikTok girlies typing \u201cgirl whatever\u201d on their videos?",
      "Over 27,000 posts and counting have used the hashtag #girlwhatever. The videos take on a similar format: Users post videos of themselves or their surroundings set to Charli XCX\u2019s song \u201cYou (Ha Ha Ha).\u201d",
      "The wide application of the \"girl whatever\" trend include: Horses running by a pool, footage from a Lady Gaga concert, a skydiving expedition, or eating a burrito on a beach. It's even reached the NFL: The Pittsburgh Steelers, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants have tapped into the trend, posting videos of their players running onto the field.",
      "But how does this two-word phrase tie all these disparate videos together? \"Girl whatever\" is everywhere \u2014 and so is confusion as to its meaning.",
      "One TikToker shared a video of her approaching the sparkling Eiffel Tower with the words, \u201cGirl whatever.\u201d But the caption was a cry for clarification: \u201cIt\u2019s not that deep \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (can someone explain this trend),\u201d she captioned the video.",
      "The top comment on the video, from creator Brett Walker, explained their take on the trend.",

      "Other TikTokers have come to the rescue with takes.",
      "The social media agency @media.alacarte, which explains TikTok trends in videos, said you can \u201cuse this iconic Charli XCX song to show how you are loving life, despite everything going on around you. Because let\u2019s be honest..it was never *that* serious.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe \u2018girl whatever\u2019 trend is all about loving yourself and embracing your main character energy,\u201d creator Melanie Martinez said in a video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also about leaving the drama and haters behind because the trivial problems and stress that they carry just have no place in your life,\u201d she added.",
      "TikToker Lizzy Lucamai offered another take on what the trend \u201creally means.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means escaping the ordinary and realizing that you were meant for something more,\u201d Lucamai wrote. \u201cIt means nurturing your wild woman spirit and chasing down your dream. It means leaving behind everything that is not meant for you, clearing space for the things that are.\u201d",
      "The phrase is \u201cnot a diss,\u201d as commenters on this post from an Olivia Rodrigo concert (which got nearly 11 million views) were quick to point out. \u201cTo the people who dont understand: the girl whatever trend goes over a video of you happy living your best lifeee (sic), this is not a diss,\u201d one comment read.",
      "Like the slang term 67, \u201cgirl whatever\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean anything too deep. It's more an attitude and a mindset \u2014 enjoying your life as it passes you by."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas has violently sought to reassert its authority over the Gaza Strip in the wake of the Israel military\u2019s partial withdrawal, but questions remain over the group\u2019s future and efforts to rebuild.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023,  attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",
      "\u201cHamas feels that this shift is something that they alone brought about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hamas ties that to its strategic picture on the ground.\u201d"

      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut I think job one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",

      "Despite being scattered across oceans and continents, the protests are connected by the frequent appearance of the same emblem: a pirate flag from a globally popular Japanese anime series.",

      "Frustrated by chronic power and water shortages, young people in Madagascar, an island nation off southeastern Africa, first took to the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Sept. 25. The protests were mobilized largely by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group that is powered by social media.",

      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",

      "According to the United Nations, at least 22 people have been killed in the Madagascar protests, a figure the government has disputed.",
      "Local protesters say they have been inspired by youth-driven movements against ruling elites in Nepal and elsewhere.",
      "The protests\u2019 global spread has been aided by the pirate flag from \u201cOne Piece,\u201d whose popularity has made its ideas about resistance accessible across languages and cultures.",

      "The bodies of three hostages were returned to Israel in the last day and the ceasefire continued to hold, however, the United States issued a warning to Hamas should it try to violate the deal with an attack on Palestinians.",
      "The World Food Programme is supplying approximately 560 tons of food every day, its spokesperson, Abeer Etefa, told reporters on Friday. However, the agency is facing challenges in ramping up the quantity, as key crossings remain shut, and in its delivery, due to destroyed roads.",

      "The IDF on Sunday identified one set of remains as those of Ronen Tommy Engel. The identity of the second person has not been publicly released.",

      "That line separates the area Israeli forces still occupy from the areas that it has withdrawn from as part of the ceasefire agreement. On Friday, the Israeli defense minister said the line would be physically marked and warned that any trespassers would be targeted.",

      "The charred and smoldering object was found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, according to the Australian Space Agency. It\u2019s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it\u2019s probably a spent rocket part.",

      "The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy.",
      "There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, the cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision \u2014 meaning an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch.",
      "Roughly 22 million people in the United States have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.",
      "In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79, were fitted with the \u201cPRIMA device,\u201d a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera \u201csees\u201d is transmitted to the chip implanted in the eye in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling the brain to interpret signals the cells send as vision.",
      "An image processor, which users must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.",
      "With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for reassessments one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,\u201d said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial\u2019s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. \u201cLate-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game changer in my mind.\u201d",
      "One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before she received the implant was akin to \u201chaving two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.\u201d A self-described \u201cavid bookworm\u201d before she lost her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.",
      "Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results are a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.",
      "\u201cEven with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,\u201d said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. The drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the United States and must be injected into the eye every one to two months. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it, and we can\u2019t do anything to bring back lost vision.\u201d",
      "Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said the PRIMA system is not without limitations.",
      "Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. \u201cYou have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,\u201d said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss.",
      "Vavvas said it was important to note that the device is not restoring normal vision, as patients were able to see only in black and white rather than color, and that the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training to learn how to see with the device. He also said it was not clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients\u2019 quality of life.",
      "But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key steppingstone in the field of vision restoration.",
      "\u201cThink of this device as the pre-release iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitations are clear. We shouldn\u2019t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still, in some ways, a prototype. They\u2019re working on iterations of this device that will be better.\u201d",
      "New upgrades to the device could be coming in the next couple of years.",
      "The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corp.",
      "Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera\u2019s zoom function, Palanker said, that could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.",
      "\u201cWe are also working on next-generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also gray-scale natural images, such as faces,\u201d Palanker said.",
      "Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.",
      "Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients\u2019 ability to function day to day. Vavvas suggested that future trials should include a control arm to understand the extent to which the device yields real-world benefits, for example compared with existing electronic magnifiers.",
      "\u201cIs it something that is good enough for patients to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve regained my independence because I can now do my credit card bills myself, stamp and address my envelopes myself, and look at grocery store labels\u2019?\u201d Garg said. \u201cThose kinds of practical things I would like to know more about.\u201d",
      "Vavvas  said: \u201cThis is a chronic disease that you will have for life, so we need more than one year of follow-up to see other risks, other problems. Does that signal of efficacy that we see at 12 months remain two years later?\u201d",
      "While Vavvas said he would not call the device a panacea for blindness, the study showed that brain-computer interfaces can represent an important approach to tackling different kinds of severe visual impairment. \u201cAs the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House on Monday on rare-earth minerals, which could serve as a bargaining chip as the United States fights a trade war with China.",
      "They signed the agreement at the top of the meeting, which Trump told the media had \"been negotiated over a period of four or five months.\"",
      "\"We got it done just in time for the visit,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we work together very much on rare earths, critical minerals and lots of other things, and we\u2019ve had a very good relationship. We\u2019ve been working on that for quite a while.\"",
      "Albanese said Australia has a $8.5 billion pipeline \"ready to go\" for the deal.",
      "A White House official said that under the deal, the U.S. and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months, with recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion.",
      "Asked whether the United States plans to lift tariffs on Australia, Trump touted his general trade policies and eventually said: \"I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\"",
      "The two leaders are also expected to discuss defense cooperation, Indo-Pacific stability and the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, Albanese\u2019s office said Sunday.",
      "Albanese, whose center-left government was re-elected in May for a second term, said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d meeting with Trump.",
      "Australia, a country of about 27 million people, hasn\u2019t figured prominently in the second Trump administration so far. Unlike many U.S. trading partners, it has a large trade deficit with the United States, earning it the minimum tariff rate of 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Australia is particularly high on Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s International and Security Affairs Program.",
      "But the rest of the world may be watching the meeting closely, she said, \u201cto see how Trump treats a traditional ally.\u201d",
      "For Albanese, the bar for success is that the meeting \u201cisn\u2019t a disaster,\u201d Shortis said, avoiding the kind of Oval Office dressing-downs Trump delivered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "Resource-rich Australia has sensed an opportunity in recent U.S.-China tensions over rare-earth minerals, which are critical components of advanced electronics and defense technologies. China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, has announced a series of export controls viewed as threatening the global supply.",
      "\u201cWe know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\u201d Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Washington on Friday.",
      "There has been some uneasiness in Australia that it has taken nine months for Trump and Albanese to have an official meeting, though they met briefly last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "But there is also uneasiness about Albanese\u2019s meeting with Trump at all.",
      "Australia, whose population closely follows U.S. politics, is among the countries most critical of Trump, with 77% of survey respondents telling the Pew Research Center in the first months of his current term that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.",
      "A poll released by the Australia Institute in May found that more than 54% of respondents preferred a more independent foreign policy over a closer alliance with the United States, an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the same poll two months earlier, shortly after Trump returned to office.",
      "Though Australian support for the U.S. alliance has historically been strong, \u201cif the United States is not seen as a democracy or a nation of laws, then the alliance with the United States will come into question,\u201d said Brendon O\u2019Connor, a professor of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign relations at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "Albanese broke with the United States last month by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. He has praised Trump over the ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Hamas war but will be cautious not to be seen as too \u201cfawning\u201d to Trump on \u201cissues around democracy and authoritarianism and internal dissent,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "The relationship has also been tested over the future of AUKUS (which stands for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States), a $240 billion trilateral security deal in which Australia would buy U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and then build a new submarine class with Britain.",
      "Australian officials have expressed confidence that the deal will move forward, even though it is currently under review by the Trump administration amid concerns that the U.S. may not be able to produce enough submarines for both itself and its ally.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy said last week that Australia would \u201cshortly\u201d make its second of three billion-dollar payments to help accelerate U.S. nuclear submarine production.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s reasons to be pretty skeptical about whether those submarines will ever arrive,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just up to Trump. I mean, six months before delivering them in the 2030s the United States can decide it doesn\u2019t have enough submarines to sell Australia three or four.\u201d",
      "Some in Australia have suggested that Albanese could shore up Trump\u2019s support for AUKUS by offering a critical minerals deal.",
      "Shortis was skeptical, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s word on any issue like this is not particularly reliable and can change very quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you offer Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The daring daylight heist at Paris' Louvre Museum was over in minutes, but it's feared the priceless Napoleonic jewelry taken by a masked gang in Sunday's brazen raid could be lost forever.",
      "After riding on a cherry picker up the museum's facade, the thieves forced open a window about 30 minutes after the museum opened and smashed up display cases in the gilded Galerie d\u2019Apollon where the Crown diamonds from France's long defunct royal families are displayed.",
      "It is not the first time the gallery has been targeted. In December 1976, masked thieves entered the same room through the same window to steal a 19th-century jeweled sword belonging to French King Charles X. It has never been recovered.",
      "After Sunday's smash-and-grab robbery, the gang, which remained at large, escaped the world\u2019s most-visited museum on motorbikes, making off with nine items, including a crown, a tiara, necklaces and earrings.",
      "Here, NBC News looks at what was stolen.",
      "Diamond-encrusted crown, brooch and tiara",
      "Containing more than 1,300 diamonds, Empress Eug\u00e9nie's crown ranks among the Louvre\u2019s most valuable pieces.",
      "Designed to reflect the grandeur of the Second French Empire, the crown which features a gold circlet topped with golden eagles, was created in 1855 by Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier, one of Paris' most famous goldsmiths at the time, two years after Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s marriage to Napoleon III.",
      "Alexandre Giquello, president of Paris' well known Drouot auction house, told Reuters it was worth tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Investigators found the crown near the Louvre after it was apparently dropped by the thieves as they made their escape. It was reportedly recovered broken.",
      "Still missing however, is a reliquary brooch set with 94 diamonds. Crafted in 1855, it holds a sacred relic as a symbol of the Empress' Catholic faith, according to the Louvre\u2019s website.",
      "A large corsage bow set with 2,438 diamonds and 196 rose-cut stones was also taken from her collection, along with a tiara containing 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, investigators said.",
      "Emerald necklace and earrings",
      "A necklace and matching earrings, commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to mark his second marriage to Marie\u2011Louise in 1810, were also taken by the thieves.",
      "With a striking 13.75-carat oval emerald at its center, the gold necklace is decorated with another 32 emeralds and more than 1,000 diamonds, according to the Louvre's website.",
      "After the fall of Napoleon\u2019s empire, Marie\u2011Louise passed the set, including a tiara, to a relative, and it remained in her family for generations. The Louvre bought it in 2004.",
      "Sapphire jewelry set",
      "Worn by successive members of the Orl\u00e9ans family, including the last queen of France, Marie-Am\u00e9lie, a sapphire parure, or a matching set of jewelry, was also taken in the raid.",
      "The necklace, earrings and tiara each feature natural Ceylon sapphires set in gold and surrounded by diamonds.",
      "Although the jewelry bears no hallmarks of any renowned royal jewelers, the Louvre describes this set as a \u201cprecious testimony to Parisian jewelry.\u201d",

      "Iranian director Jafar Panahi puts a lot on the line for his work.",
      "Authorities could again arrest him for speaking out against the country\u2019s hard-line regime. They could send him back to the notoriously cruel Evin Prison in Tehran, which houses many of Iran\u2019s political dissidents. He could again be placed on house arrest and barred from making films.",
      "But Panahi, now 65, has largely ignored these attempts at silencing him over the years, instead focusing on doing what he loves most: making films about his homeland.",
      "When he was imprisoned and charged with \u201cpropagandizing against the government,\u201d he went on a hunger strike until authorities released him on bail. His filmmaking ban \u2014 which was supposed to last for 20 years \u2014 ended up serving as creative inspiration, fueling critically acclaimed films such as \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d and \u201cTaxi.\u201d",
      "With his latest movie, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was released in limited North American theaters over the weekend, Panahi once again defied the government\u2019s attempts to censor his art, though it has meant putting himself at risk.",
      "\u201cYou have to find a way around the system,\u201d Panahi said in a recent interview conducted in Farsi at a hotel in Santa Monica, California, and translated into English by NBC News. Panahi, known for the signature sunglasses that he sports at every event, was sitting in the lobby next to his translator after enjoying a smoke break outside.",
      "The filmmaker has had a busy few months traveling the world to promote his film, a buzzy Oscar contender that was picked up for distribution in North America by Neon. He has also faced several hurdles coming from Iran \u2014 including missing a New York Film Festival screening after his visa process was delayed, reportedly because of the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "While on the press tour, he has continued to champion his message of the importance of freedom of expression.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d a revenge drama that is sprinkled with comedic moments, follows a group of Iranians who capture a man whom they suspect was their interrogator while they were in prison. They quarrel about the man they have put in the back of their van and whether he is in fact the guard, noting both have an artificial leg that makes a squeaking noise when walking. The group also grapples with the morality behind taking vengeance, and whether that makes them just as bad as those who oppressed them.",
      "Panahi reflected on how his own time in prison shaped \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was the first film he directed after  spending seven months in Evin from 2022 to 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen you are imprisoned, it does not matter which group, which category and which party you are. We are all living with each other. And then when you go out, you can\u2019t separate from it. These all remain in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience stays in your brain, and after you leave \u2026 you feel like you have to do something to express this.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker has previously spoken about his time at the prison, recalling how he was placed in solitary confinement and blindfolded during his hourslong interrogations. He drew from his own experiences, as well as from fellow political prisoners he met there, in writing the film, making it one of his most personal endeavors to date.",
      "But authorities in Iran oversee the media, so filmmakers must get their scripts approved to get film permits. While Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, he chose to shoot in secret, filming in Iran over the course of several weeks without official permission from the government because of the film\u2019s sensitive subject matter.",
      "The crew shot scenes in a remote desert location, in a van and in the streets of Tehran. Expecting trouble from authorities, the crew also took precautionary steps while moving around the city. Panahi told Vulture that in the summer of 2024, the crew was stopped by police during filming. They were asked to turn everything over but they handed over an empty memory card from a camera, rather than the actual footage of the film.",
      "They then waited a few weeks to resume the project and ended up editing part of the movie in France for safety reasons after the cast and crew had a run-in with authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make a movie in Iran, you have to accept that is not possible through a regular path, you have to find an alternative path, and you either have to find it yourself or use other people\u2019s experience in doing so,\u201d Panahi said.",
      "Despite his years of political dissent and the personal price he has paid, Panahi is humble. He explained that it\u2019s the people of Iran who deserve praise for continuing to stand up to the government in the aftermath of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered huge, monthslong public protests that were labeled the Women, Life, Freedom movement.",
      "\u201cThey are more brave than I am,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s someone who is \u201cwell known\u201d and because of that has \u201csome protections in place.\u201d The activists \u201care not known to anyone,\u201d he said. They took to the streets, were jailed and released, and still continue to protest in their own ways.",
      "For example, there are women in Iran who now refuse to wear the mandatory hijab, instead walking around with their hair flowing freely. It\u2019s a subtle act of defiance that Panahi captured in his film, which shows its two female stars without headscarves in public in several scenes.",
      "It was important to Panahi to depict a \u201ctruthful picture of Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in history where everything is measured by whether it happened before or after the Women, Life, Freedom movement. If it\u2019s before, and you were showing in your film that there was a woman without the headscarf covering, it would not be believable.\u201d",
      "Those who admire Panahi say his art serves as its own powerful form of activism, as he balances politics with a personal touch that helps breathe levity into heavier topics.",
      "At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Panahi won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or after the film received a nearly eight-minute standing ovation.",
      "The win marked the second time an Iranian filmmaker took home the award (Abbas Kiarostami was the first, winning in 1997 for \u201cTaste of Cherry\u201d). Panahi has now received the top prize at all three major European film festivals, including Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear for \u201cTaxi\u201d in 2015 and the Golden Lion at Venice for \u201cThe Circle\u201d in 2000.",
      "Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche, who served as the 2025 Cannes jury president, said that \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d \u201csprings from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very human and political at the same time, because he comes from a complicated country,\u201d she said at the event, according to Deadline. \u201cWhen we watched the film, it stood out.\u201d",
      "At the New York Film Festival earlier this month, Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese also praised Panahi and called on more streaming services to champion Iranian cinema.",
      "As the film continues to rack up positive reviews and vies for Oscar nods, Panahi plans to continue to promote it at events.",
      "Other Iranian filmmakers, including Panahi\u2019s friend and fellow director Mohammad Rasoulof, have fled Iran to avoid facing fierce punishment.",
      "But when asked whether he fears the Iranian government lashing out at him again, Panahi appeared undeterred.",
      "\u201cWhat are they going to do that they haven\u2019t done already?\u201d he said."

      "The break-in happened at around 9:30 a.m. local time as the museum was opening, French Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez told radio station France Inter. Two people, with their faces concealed, used power tools to break into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon through a window, the prosecutor's office said. The crew had brought a crane lift mounted on a truck and appeared to have scouted the location in advance.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez said the \u201cexperienced\u201d thieves broke into the gallery with a disc cutter. The stolen jewels had been kept behind glass inside the gallery, he added. The daring morning heist, which lasted just seven minutes, forced the museum to close for the day, officials said.",
      "The break-in triggered alarms on the exterior of the window of the Galerie d\u2019Apollon and on the two high-security display cabinets targeted by the thieves inside the gallery, the Ministry of Culture in Paris said Sunday, describing the brazen theft as \u201cparticularly rapid and brutal.\u201d",
      "Five museum workers were in the room and adjacent rooms and immediately contacted police, the culture ministry said.",
      "The thieves targeted two glass display cabinets housing \u201cpriceless\u201d jewels and threatened guards, who evacuated the premises, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.",
      "The Ministry of Culture credited the quick-thinking employees and their calls to police with prompting the thieves to flee, leaving behind their equipment and some of the stolen items.",
      "Before fleeing the scene, the thieves allegedly attempted to set fire to the crane lift they had used, the prosecutor's office said. A museum worker thwarted that attempt, the culture ministry said.",
      "An image from the scene showed what appeared to be a furniture elevator propped up against a balcony, with police gathered nearby to cordon off the area.",
      "French Culture Minister Rachida Dati said earlier on X that \u201cno injuries were reported.\u201d",
      "A recent string of heists",
      "The Galerie d\u2019Apollon \u2014 or Apollo Gallery \u2014 is home to many of France\u2019s crown jewels and historic diamonds. It also features hard-stone vessels collected by French kings, including jade and rock crystal, according to the Louvre\u2019s website.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez said \u200bthe museum was evacuated \u201cmainly to preserve evidence and clues so that investigators could work undisturbed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI expect we will very soon find the thieves and jewels,\u201d he added.",
      "An investigation into organized theft and criminal conspiracy to commit crime has been launched by the Paris public prosecutor\u2019s office, a source inside the office told NBC News."

      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s Metropolitan Police are \u201cactively looking into\u201d reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre, a spokesperson for the force told NBC News on Sunday.",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, had alleged that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein trafficked her to his powerful friends, including Andrew, against whom she filed a lawsuit in 2021 alleging that he sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "British newspaper the Mail on Sunday reported that Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate Giuffre before a photo was published in February 2011, showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre. The newspaper cited an email reportedly containing a request from Andrew, not seen by NBC News.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Andrew \u201csought to dig up dirt\u201d on Giuffre.",
      "A spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police said: \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied that the photo of him with Giuffre is real, and denies any wrongdoing connected with Epstein. He has not commented on the newspaper reports and did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "A flow of stories about Prince Andrew\u2019s association with Epstein has dogged King Charles III\u2019s younger brother for six years, with the scandal becoming one of the most damaging in recent British royal history.",
      "The reports came two days after Andrew announced he would stop using his royal titles, including the Duke of York, after facing fresh questions over his friendship with Epstein.",
      "The decision was taken \u201cin discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family,\u201d he said in a statement, after concluding that \u201cthe continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d Andrew said.",
      "His former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will no longer be known as the Duchess of York.",
      "Andrew stepped back from active royal duties in 2019 as controversy around his association with Epstein swirled. He reached a settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in 2022 with no admission of wrongdoing."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged President Donald Trump to get tougher with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, saying he was ready to join their upcoming summit in Budapest and remained optimistic despite leaving the United States without the weapons he was seeking.",
      "The Ukrainian leader told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview taped Friday that Trump needed to apply even more pressure on Putin than he had applied to Hamas during his recent success in securing a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\u201cPutin is something similar but more strong than Hamas,\u201d Zelenskyy said. The war is bigger and Russia\u2019s army is the second biggest in the world, he added, \u201cand that\u2019s why more pressure\u201d is needed.",
      "Zelenskyy had hoped that part of that pressure would be the delivery of long-range U.S. Tomahawk missiles that could be used to strike deep into Russia.",
      "Trump had publicly floated the possibility of providing Tomahawks to Ukraine, but appeared to limit expectations about an agreement when he met with Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, one day after a phone call with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy, who spoke to NBC News shortly after that visit, said it was \u201cgood that President Trump didn\u2019t say \u2018no,\u2019 but for today, didn\u2019t say \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "Putin has warned that supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would be a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation.\u201d Zelenskyy said that Putin is \u201cafraid that United States will deliver us Tomahawks. And I think that he [is] really afraid that we will use\u201d them.",
      "Trump announced after his call with Putin that he would meet with the Russian president in Budapest, Hungary, for a second round of in-person talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy called Putin a \u201cterrorist\u201d during his interview with NBC News, but reiterated his willingness to meet with the Russian president face to face.",
      "\u201cIf we really want to have just and lasting peace, we need both sides of this tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can there be some deals without us about us?\u201d",
      "Asked if he would push to go to Budapest, Zelenskyy said he had told Trump: \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s last bid to get the two leaders to meet fizzled out after initial optimism, with the Kremlin rebuffing U.S. efforts.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s latest visit to the U.S. came as Russia hammered Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure with drones and missiles in the past week, leading to blackouts across the country. Ukraine has been carrying out its own campaign targeting Russia\u2019s energy supply in a bid to impose economic pain on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia was stepping up airstrikes across Ukraine because of its \u201cweak position\u201d on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why he really escalates airstrikes,\u201d Zelenskyy added, saying Putin wants an \u201cenergy disaster this winter by attacking us.\u201d",
      "Trump said in a social media post after meeting with Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia \u201cshould stop where they are,\u201d and that it was time to \u201cstop the killing, and make a DEAL.\u201d",
      "Russia currently controls nearly 44,600 square miles, or 19%, of Ukraine, including a major chunk of territory in the east and southeast of the country, according to open-source maps of the battlefield.",
      "Asked if he was willing to negotiate or give up some territory in order to end the war, Zelenskyy said: \u201cIf we want to stop this war and to go to peace negotiations urgently and in diplomatic way, we need to stay where we stay, not to give something additional to Putin.\u201d",
      "Peace talks have to take place in quiet, he added. \u201cNot under missiles, not under drones.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Trump can end the war, Zelenskyy said: \u201cGod bless, yes.\u201d"
