      "The Broadway revival of \u201cChicago\u201d has lasted for decades, in part thanks to casting celebrities in the top spots of a show about the venality of celebrity",
      "NEW YORK -- There's only one Roxie Hart. And yet \u2014 stay with us here \u2014 there are many Roxie Harts.",
      "The murderous, washed-up chorus girl is the beating, biting heart of Broadway's mainstay musical \u201cChicago,\u201d but no single actor owns her. She instead belongs to a revolving sisterhood of performers who, at a glance, have little in common \u2014 but all have donned a bowler hat and slinked across the stage.",
      "There are the musical theater professionals far from household names. Others, much like Roxie herself, have notoriety but little stage experience. Some are ingenues on the cusp of fame. Some are world-weary, looking to reclaim the spotlight.",
      "Since 1996, the list of Roxies has included Brooke Shields, Sandy Duncan, Marilu Henner, Christie Brinkley, Mel B, Gretchen Mol, Brandy, Robin Givens, Lisa Rinna, Ashlee Simpson, Jennifer Nettles, \u201cTrading Spaces\u201d host Paige Davis, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d winner Jinkx Monsoon, \u201cPose\u201d star Angelica Ross and Ariana Madix of \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Chicago\u2019 is different,\u201d says Barry Weissler, a lead producer with his wife, Fran. \u201cIt welcomes people constantly. There\u2019s never a locked door where we\u2019re concerned.\u201d",
      "Roxie isn't a cute role: She kills her lover and tries to get her dimwitted husband to take the blame. She grows insatiably hungry for fame behind bars and, after an acquittal, teams up with rival Velma to cash in with a revue. \u201cThe name on everybody\u2019s lips / Is gonna be Roxie,\u201d she purrs.",
      "The revival has lasted for decades, attributable in part to often casting celebrities to lead a show about the venality of celebrity.",
      "\u201cThe casting of this show falls in line with the show itself,\u201d says choreographer Greg Butler, who helps prepare actors in Los Angeles. \u201cWe talk about celebrity and how celebrity is glorified. And yet, in a way, we glorify it.\u201d",
      "Glorified though they may be, the stars still have to perform. So how does \u201cChicago\u201d turn a reality star into Roxie?",
      "Each Roxie needs to memorize their lines, sing and make it down a ladder in high heels. But there's elasticity built into the role.",
      "The secret about Roxie: She has two really big songs \u2014 \u201cFunny Honey\u201d and \u201cRoxie\u201d \u2014 but the role isn\u2019t as physically taxing as Velma's. And Roxie will always be taken care of.",
      "\u201cI always say when we bring these celebrities in, we must protect them so that everyone around them and every other part is a full-blooded Broadway pro,\u201d director Walter Bobbie reveals.",
      "In \u201cRoxie,\u201d the merry murderess is surrounded by smitten, superb male dancers.",
      "\u201cRoxie could simply stand there and have seven men adore her and the number is delivered,\u201d Bobbie says.",
      "Some Roxies need lots of work, including singing lessons. Some Roxies you leave alone. Take Pamela Anderson, who was a hit in 2022.",
      "\u201cLet her do whatever she wants,\u201d Weissler says. \u201cSo she can\u2019t do a somersault, she can\u2019t do a split. It\u2019s all right because she IS Roxie.\u201d",
      "The team tries to incorporate the star's signatures. Underneath Anderson's dress, for instance, the costume shop added fabric that looked like a bathing suit bottom, a nod to \u201cBaywatch.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one in the show tries to imitate anybody else\u2019s performance. I always try to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to play Roxie. I want you to find the Roxie in yourself,\u2019\u201d Bobbie says.",
      "It all begins, though, with landing a willing celebrity.",
      "\u201cWhen I approach an agent for a star \u2014 no matter how big or small \u2014 I always say, \u2018Ask not what you can do for \u201cChicago\u201d but what \u201cChicago\u201d can do for you,\u2019\u201d says Duncan Stewart, who has landed castmembers for nearly two decades.",
      "Stewart, ARC vice president and casting director, emphasizes the part's glamour and razzle-dazzle in negotiations, as well as its relative ease. All you need is some training and the willingness to wear a black cocktail dress.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to dress up as a spoon or a fork. You don\u2019t have to dress up in green paint and sing through the stratosphere,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can rehearse for four weeks and you can do a quick six-week run. You can get your Broadway debut and legacy in under eight weeks.\u201d",
      "Sometimes a celebrity will mull a pitch for years. Sometimes they need just days.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing. It\u2019s all about persistence and never accepting a no,\u201d Stewart says. (If a target Roxie ages out of the role, he says, the offer shifts to Matron \u201cMama\u201d Morton.)",
      "Celebrities sign up for different reasons: Broadway is on their bucket list. Their latest tour sold poorly. They were recently divorced. They're doing it for their kids.",
      "\u201cThey need some way of saying to the world, \u2018I\u2019m worthy. I can prove my mettle,\u2019\u201d says Stewart.",
      "Once or twice a year he goes to a newsstand and buys $400 worth of magazines \u2014 Ebony, People, Variety, you name it. He hands them to his staff, along with black pens.",
      "His instructions: \u201cThere are no bad ideas. Circle everybody from these magazines and just write in black pen, \u2018Roxie,\u2019 \u2018Velma,\u2019 \u2018Billy,\u2019 \u2018Amos,\u2019 \u2018Mama.\u2019\u201d",
      "The names go into a spreadsheet, which goes to the marketing team and producers, who score the names from one to five. One is terrible. Three, four and five prompt him to pursue interest and availability.",
      "Stewart then puts together a dossier with background details on the potential Roxie \u2014 perhaps she played saxophone in high school or sang with a band. He delivers the report and any YouTube footage to the Weisslers.",
      "With their green light, the offer goes out \u2014 contingent on a successful boot camp.",
      "Like the military, Roxie\u2019s boot camp is meant to build volunteers up \u2014 with a lot less screaming.",
      "\u201cWe try to meet them where they are,\u201d says Butler, an associate choreographer since 2005 who performed in the show for 14 years and was a dance captain.",
      "\u201cThey have something that you can\u2019t really teach them. They understand the idea of celebrity,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are pulling from life.\u201d",
      "Butler usually asks the Roxie-to-be to draw on what they know: red carpets, news conferences, getting their pictures taken by paparazzi. They go from there.",
      "\u201cUltimately, your feet are probably going to have to leave the ground and you\u2019re probably going to have to kick. So I\u2019m going to have to teach you how to punch your foot,\u201d he tells his starry students.",
      "He started one session with Rita Wilson by asking her if she had a favorite pose. \u201cAnd she was like, \u2018Oh my God! I have this pose,\u2019\u201d Butler says. \u201cWe used it and then she starts to build from that.\u201d",
      "The original \u201cChicago\u201d debuted on Broadway in 1975, directed by Bob Fosse. Butler credits Ann Reinking \u2014 the iconic Fosse collaborator who originated Roxie in the 1996 revival and created the choreography in Fosse's style \u2014 with cracking how to accommodate the skillset of each successive Roxie. Vocal coaches also help find the right keys and approach to each song.",
      "One of the harder things Roxie faces comes during the song \u201cHot Honey Rag.\u201d In a sequence nicknamed The Cakewalk, the actor must dance backward while executing a series of intricate hand movements. Trained dancers, like Reinking, rely on their strong cores. But Melanie Griffith, primarily a film actor, struggled with The Cakewalk. The two experimented with different ideas as Griffith prepared to become Roxie in 2003.",
      "\u201cShe just started doing a move and Annie saw her do this thing and she went, \u2018Oh my, God! OK. Do that again,\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "What Griffith had done was fan her hands over her head and make her hips and hands move at the same time.",
      "\u201cAnnie, said \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s your move,\u2019\u201d he recounts. \u201cSo now there\u2019s a step in the show that we call The Melanie, just in case I have an actress where The Cakewalk does not look awesome on them.\u201d",
      "Some elements may be tweaked but make no mistake: It's hard work.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s new parts of my body that are sore that I didn\u2019t know would actually get sore,\u201d says Alyssa Milano, one of the newest Roxies, in the middle of her boot camp. \u201cAnd I've been a dancer all my life.\u201d",
      "The Roxies who don't have extensive stage or dance backgrounds may feel vulnerable.",
      "\u201cI tell them that falls right in line with Roxie Hart,\u201d Butler says. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Honey, you are halfway there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Melora Hardin was more than halfway there. \u201cThe Office\u201d star arrived not only able to sing, but also as a lifelong dancer, first in ballet and then in jazz.",
      "Hardin was taught a few numbers in a Valley studio before flying to New York to perform in front of Weissler and his team.",
      "She could tell they liked it.",
      "\u201cBarry walks me to the window and kind of puts his arm around my shoulder and asks, \u2018Where have you been? Why haven't I met you before?\u2019\u201d she remembers.",
      "She got the job on the spot.",
      "Fast-forward and Hardin in late 2008 made her Broadway debut, with her husband and two young daughters in the audience. When fans threw her roses, she'd try to toss them to her girls. She laughs that the crowd seemed more impressed by her somersault than nailing her Fosse steps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that I will hold as one of the most joyful times of my life,\u201d says Hardin. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a more wonderful experience.\u201d",
      "Roxie has been kicking for more than 11,000 performances on Broadway, despite recession, storms, a pandemic and an Oscar-winning adaptation. \u201cChicago\u201d is the second longest-running show in Broadway history, behind only the now-closed \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d In all, the musical has been seen by more than 32 million people across 36 countries and more than 500 cities.",
      "\u201cThe show changes from actor to actor, from country to country, from city to city, from company to company,\u201d says Butler.",
      "But Butler has his favorites. He still gets excited whenever one of his Roxies slays: \u201cIt\u2019s like giving birth. I\u2019m just like, \u2018Oh, my God, my little baby\u2019s about to step up!\u2019\u201d",
      "Trends come and go, but \u201cChicago\u201d endures, fed by a plot replete with celebrity culture, greed and media manipulation. \u201cIt keeps becoming more relevant, not less. More,\u201d says Weissler.",
      "Bobbie bristles at critics who deride the revolving door as a gimmick: \u201cYou can call it stunt casting all you want. There\u2019s an authenticity to it.\u201d",
      "He argues that \u201cChicago\u201d will always be different than most other Broadway shows.",
      "\u201cThe guy doesn't get the girl. The girl gets the girl,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cThis is about a romance with show business.\u201d",

      "Crime writer John D",
      "NEW YORK -- Crime writer John D. MacDonald, a master of the genre, was so prolific that sometimes even he couldn't keep up with what he was doing.",
      "He might have dozens of stories in submission at once and would leave some unfinished or unpublished as he moved on to a new idea. One of the surviving manuscripts was recently discovered and appears this week in the literary quarterly The Strand Magazine, which has run rarities by Ernest Hemingway,Tennessee Williams and many others. \"The Accomplice\u201d is an early work from the author known for his Travis McGee series and for the novel \u201cThe Executioners,\u201d retitled \u201cCape Fear\u201d in two film adaptations.",
      "The newly seen story, a narrative of lust, betrayal and dangerous choices, was found in the archives at the University of Florida.",
      "\u201cRaw and gritty, the narrative embraces classic noir tropes, only to flip them in quintessential MacDonald style with an unexpected and thought-provoking finale,\u201d Strand managing editor Andrew F. Gulli writes in the current issue.",
      "\u201cThe Accomplice\u201d is set in a grocery store where a \u201cnearly\u201d 18-year clerk named Joey works alongside the middle-aged owner, John Mallon, and his younger wife, Belle, whom MacDonald introduces as tall and long-faced, very white and so thin and taut that \u201cher hips stuck out against the dresses she wore.\u201d Before long, she is paying close attention to Joey, who would prefer \u2014 at first \u2014 that she keep it all professional.",
      "\u201cIt scared him a little when he realized that when they were alone, in the store he\u2019d head for the space behind the meat counter or the entrance to the cellar where the stock was kept, knowing that she would find some excuse to go by him,\u201d MacDonald writes.",
      "\u201cAfter he realized that, he had a hard time getting to sleep at night and sometimes he would dream about her. In the dreams she was cold to touch, and like snakes. And then she would get mixed up in the dream with other girls.\u201d",
      "In a plot turn known to fans of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and other noir favorites, Belle proposes that they kill her husband and use the insurance money to go into business together.",
      "\"She whispered, \u2018How are we going to do it, Joey?\u2019\u201d",
      "MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, in 1916, and later moved with his family to Utica, New York, where he was still living when he wrote \u201cThe Accomplice.\u201d He settled in Sarasota, Florida in the early 1950s and remained for decades before dying in Milwaukee, in 1986. His books have sold millions of copies and numerous authors, including Stephen King, have cited him as an influence. He is especially loved in Florida, and was honored in song by another famous state resident, Jimmy Buffett, who offered tribute in \u201cIncommunicado.\u201d",
      "According to MacDonald scholar Calvin Branche, the author likely wrote \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d in the late 1940s-early 1950s and set it aside amidst other projects. His wife, Dorothy, had gotten one of his stories published while he was serving overseas in World War II, and he was anxious to follow up, writing some 80 hours a week. MacDonald was still a few years away from his Travis McGee books, but Branche said that \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d did anticipate the moral struggles of McGee and other MacDonald protagonists.",
      "\u201c(Joey) stands up to her temptation despite having initially thought her plan and a future with her might be good,\u201d Branche says. \u201cThe reader is pleased with this conclusion, and it is the kind of insight characters find in many of the stories.\u201d"

    "summary": "Over the four years he&rsquo;s spent working on &ldquo;Mufasa: The Lion King,&rdquo; Barry Jenkins estimates that he&rsquo;s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times",
    "story": [
      "Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times",
      "NEW YORK -- Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times.",
      "The question of why Jenkins, the filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d would want to jump into the big-budget, photorealistic animated Disney world of lions and tigers has bedeviled much of a film world that reveres him.",
      "Countless other directors had made leaps into CGI-heavy blockbuster-making before. But Jenkins\u2019 decision was uniquely analyzed \u2013 perhaps because there\u2019s no more heralded, or trusted, filmmaker today under the age of 50 than Jenkins.",
      "\u201cIt just thought it was something I could not deny,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI had to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, brings together movie worlds that ordinarily stay very far apart. On the one hand, you have the Oscar-winning, 45-year-old director of some of the most luminous and lyrical films of the past decade. On the other, you have the intellectual property imperatives of today\u2019s Hollywood. What happens when they collide?",
      "The result in \u201cMufasa,\u201d about the lion cub's orphaned upbringing set both before and after the events of Jon Favreau's 2019 remake of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d is an uncommonly textured and thoughtfully rendered spectacle that, Jenkins maintained in a recent interview, has more in common with \u201cMoonlight\u201d than you\u2019d think. Made with virtual filmmaking tools, \u201cMufasa\u201d essentially plopped one of the most groundbreaking filmmakers working today into an all-digital playground, with a budget more than a hundred times that of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d",
      "Often in \u201cMufasa,\u201d you can feel Jenkins\u2019 sensibility warming and enhancing what can, in other less sensitively commanded films, feel soulless. With songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201cMufasa\u201d works as a big-movie entertainment and, even more surprisingly, as a Barry Jenkins film.",
      "\u201cMy head was spinning when this started,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt actually reminded me of when I first got into filmmaking. This felt oddly enough very similar to that first experience. You can sort of run away from that newness and be intimidated by it, or you can embrace it, learn the things you don\u2019t know and then start to bend it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also an experience that has quite evidently changed Jenkins, exponentially expanding his filmmaking tool kit while opening his eyes to new ways of making movies. \u201cIt was almost like learning a new language,\u201d Jenkins says of the process. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.",
      "Jenkins: At least 400 times. But it came down to the spirit and the warmth of Jeff Nathanson\u2019s script and also the spirit and the warmth I always found in the story. I came to \u201cThe Lion King\u201d by babysitting my nephews way, way back in the 1990s. My sister was a single mom and I\u2019d be at home watching with the kids. You\u2019d put on different VHSs and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d was always the one that stuck. I just thought: Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to, coming out of something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d to step into this thing that\u2019s so full of light?",
      "JENKINS: Maybe warmer, lighter but still just as deep, just as spiritual. This idea of family legacy, of finding your place in the world, those are things that are very present in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d If I was telling you, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this film about this kid who has this almost biblical experience involving water and a parent figure that he then gets displaced from, and has to find his place in the world, I could be talking about \u201cMoonlight\u201d or I could be talking about \u201cMufasa.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: It wasn\u2019t about the notions of who people thought I was. But I was looking to expand just the kind of filmmaking I was doing at that point. This came right in the thick of pretty much a seven-year cycle, from beginning \u201cMoonlight\u201d to being in post on \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d the way this movie is made, with this virtual production, it\u2019s just a very new way of making films. There\u2019s maybe been five or six movies made with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: I did. We evolved this process to the point where we could create so much of all the world and the movement in virtual space, and we could then take our virtual cameras into virtual production. We evolved the animation to the point where we could create the light, we could create the set, we could create the environment. (Cinematographer) James (Laxton) would be there and I would be there, and we\u2019re blasting the voices of the actors into the room and the animators are moving through and I\u2019m directing the blocking, and the camera is responding to the blocking in real time.",
      "JENKINS: Absolutely. Look, I\u2019m a filmmaker who was on set with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d I\u2019ve got 25 days and the sun is going down. Yeah, you\u2019re trying to find a place for the camera, you have ideas, but those ideas aren\u2019t practically achievable. In this sense, the camera could be anywhere. It could be everywhere. It\u2019s sort of the same questions but the possibility of answering is so immediate and direct.",
      "JENKINS: I want to unpack what you just said. We\u2019ve been talking, and I\u2019ve been talking about using these tools to create a very physical, in-person experience. I don\u2019t consider this a project that\u2019s all digital and all computer animated. If I made this movie again right now, it wouldn\u2019t take me four years. It\u2019d probably take me two and a quarter. If I was going to do another one of these films, I would have such a stronger foundation. It wouldn\u2019t feel like something that\u2019s alien or something that\u2019s other or that\u2019s all digital. It would just feel like filmmaking.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. I love through this process I\u2019ve learned so many other ways of making a film that I just could not learn making something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d What I love now is the overlap between the two of them. When I began this process, I talked to Matt Reeves because I had heard he had used some of these tools to pre-vis \u201cThe Batman.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know that shot where the Penguin is in his car and Batman is walking upside down? I discovered that in the volume.\u201d I said, \u201cOf course you did.\u201d I was like, Oh my God, we could have pre-vised \u201cMoonlight\u201d with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. The light can be anywhere in this film and the camera can be anywhere. That doesn\u2019t mean it should be everywhere. The next time I go out to make a film whether it\u2019s something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d or \u201cBeale Street,\u201d James and I are probably going to incorporate these tools as well. Because figuring out the light is half the battle, as they say in \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: This is all new. It\u2019s all being developed right now. We went down to \u201cAvatar\u201d and spoke to the engineers there. They heard what we were trying to do and sent some people to embed with us and they helped us evolve our process, so we could have these animators with two legs move as if they have four legs. What I\u2019m saying is: This is the wild, wild West."

    "story": [
      "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- An attorney defending Jay-Z against the rape allegation brought against him last week by an unnamed woman outlined a range of evidence Monday that he said showed the accuser\u2019s account to be \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "The woman told NBC News last week that Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sexually assaulted her in 2000, when she was 13, at an after-party for the MTV Music Awards. She has since acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

      "NEW YORK -- Come and take a trip to the giddy birth of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll through the eyes of one of its pioneers \u2014 Brenda Lee.",
      "The \u201cI'm Sorry\u201d and \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d hitmaker who shared stages with both Elvis Presley and the Beatles is a guide to those heady years in \u201cAmerican Masters \u2014 Brenda Lee: Rockin\u2019 Around,\u201d which premieres Monday on PBS.",
      "\u201cThat era can never be repeated again,\u201d she tells The Associated Press on the eve of the broadcast. \u201cThat was an era when the money wasn\u2019t thought about, the fame wasn\u2019t thought about. I know that sounds crazy, but it is true. The artists of that time were there to do their thing, and they loved it, whether they got paid or not.\u201d",
      "Lee, 80, had her first hit record in 1960 at age 15 and went on to sell more than 100 million albums. In the \u201960s, she earned more Hot 100 singles in the United States \u2014 46 \u2014 than any recording artist besides the Beatles, Presley or Ray Charles. She won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.",
      "She is the rare artist inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, moving effortlessly in her career between country, pop, rock and rockabilly sounds.",
      "\u201cI never classified myself as a ballad singer, as a rock singer, as a country singer or anything. I just wanted to sing,\u201d she says in the interview. \u201cSome artists can sing it all. Not me. I have to love what I\u2019m singing or it\u2019s not believable.\u201d",
      "The documentary draws on the commentary of musicologists and such stars as Keith Urban, Tanya Tucker, Trisha Yearwood, Jackie DeShannon, Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo.",
      "\u201cI had no trouble getting people to talk about Brenda and why she matters and why we should look to her,\u201d says director Barbara Hall. \u201cThis is what\u2019s possible when you just get your head down and stay focused and do what you know you\u2019re good at and don\u2019t give up.\u201d",
      "Lee was the daughter of a carpenter in Atlanta who died in a construction accident when she was just 8. Her mother soon was forced to work in the cotton mill. When she was 10, country music singer Red Foley put her on his national TV program \u201cOzark Jubilee.\u201d By age 12, she had appeared on various network TV variety shows.",
      "The portrait that emerges is a rare one for the music industry, the story of a young woman who is protected and nurtured. Lee credits producer Owen Bradley; her manager, Dub Allbritten; and the musicians she worked with for looking out for her, treating her like a little sister.",
      "\u201cI hear horror stories about children in show business, but I certainly didn\u2019t have that experience, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt was like I was one of the group, and that was so important to me.\u201d",
      "The holidays are when Lee shines most, with her hit \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d in high rotation. In 2023, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time ever, 65 years after the song\u2019s debut.",
      "\u201cShe is in your house every Christmas,\u201d says Hall. \u201cShe is a part of something that so many Americans celebrate. So, I\u2019m hoping that people will embrace her story and her music once they get reintroduced to it.\u201d",
      "She recorded it at age 13 in July 1958, not exactly a snowy time in the South.

      "The sports movie, like any genre, can easily fall victim to overly familiar story beats",
      "NEW YORK -- The sports movie, like any genre, can easily fall victim to overly familiar story beats. An underdog challenger. A big match. You know how the rest goes.",
      "But a trio of new movies brings some original moves, and a few curveballs, to a genre where tried-and-true formula often reigns supreme. In a movie year that\u2019s already given us \u201cChallengers\u201d \u2013 a tennis movie that has almost nothing to do with tennis and everything to do with the dynamics of a threesome \u2013 these movies carve out their own place in the hard knocks world of sports dramas.",
      "Each, curiously enough, is a directorial debut by an industry veteran. And each features, among other fine performances, one of the great standbys of the sports film and the abiding refuge of great character actors: the inspirational coach.",
      "Jack Huston\u2019s \u201cDay of the Fight,\u201d currently playing in theaters, stars Michael Pitt as down-and-out middleweight boxer \u201cIrish\u201d Mike Flannigan. He is, like some battered boxers before him, seeking redemption. Flannigan\u2019s once-promising career was long ago derailed by a fatal drunk driving accident. But on this day, he\u2019s preparing for an unlikely opportunity: an undercard bout at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cDay of the Fight\u201d is loosely based on the 1951 Stanley Kubrick documentary short of the same name, and it\u2019s likewise in black and white. Huston, the \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d actor and grandson to director John Huston, has mulled the movie since watching his \u201cBoardwalk\u201d co-star Pitt, the sometimes troubled but always talented actor.",
      "\u201cI had in my head this image of Michael Pitt punching a sandbag when we were on the set of \u2018Boardwalk,'\" says Huston. \"I think his life in a strange way mimics that of a boxer \u2014 sometimes the ups, sometimes the downs. Specifically where he is in his life right now, he has the essence of that boxer mentality. He can take a punch but, guess what, he keeps standing up.\u201d",
      "\u201cDay of the Fight\u201d culminates in the Madison Square Garden match, but the movie is largely about the preamble to the fight. The movie follows Flannigan on a series of poignant errands.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film where you didn\u2019t necessarily need the boxing match,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThe boxing match became icing.\u201d",
      "The film instead evolves as an elegiac character study of a man, pummeled by life, trying to put things in order.",
      "\u201cMe and Michael used to speak about how you can walk into any boxing gyms and you\u2019d find multiple stories just like Irish Mike\u2019s,\u201d says Huston. \u201cThese guys go through it. I think that\u2019s probably why their world is so fascinating to us.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: Ron Perlman. Though \u201cDay of the Fight\u201d is graced by a several father figures (Joe Pesci, Steve Buscemi), the one that really stands out is Perlman\u2019s coach. Perlman, the spectacular character actor, has all the gravitas and crustiness you\u2019d ever want in a boxing coach.",
      "William Goldenberg, the Oscar-winning editor (\u201cArgo,\u201d \u201cHeat\u201d) directs this based-on-a-true-story drama about the life of NCAA champion wrestler Anthony Robles, played by Jharrel Jerome. The film, which arrives Jan. 16 on Prime Video, chronicles Robles\u2019 constant hardships, not the least of which is that he was born without his right leg.",
      "While \u201cUnstoppable\u201d does steer toward the moment of ultimate triumph for Robles, it carefully and naturally dramatizes his long road to the championship. It\u2019s less about Robles\u2019 overcoming one challenge than it is about his perseverance through constant adversary. Jennifer Lopez co-stars as his mother, with Bobby Cannavale as an abusive step father.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s a movie about an athlete who wins, so there\u2019s going to be certain tropes that are unavoidable. And I didn\u2019t want to avoid them,\u201d says Goldenberg. \u201cI just wanted to try to do them in an organic, real-feeling way. Shooting handheld was the idea that we\u2019re with him along the journey, so you feel like you were facing the challenges he faces.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a constant battle,\u201d says Robles. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I felt going through my life, whether it was on a mat against a flesh and blood opponent or it was in my family life or the world. There was always something I was fighting against.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnstoppable\u201d is unique for another reason. While Jerome, the charismatic up-and-coming actor of \u201cMoonlight,\" bulked up for the role and devoted himself to shadowing Robles, he couldn\u2019t do everything that Robles could. For the wrestling scenes, Robles was Jerome\u2019s body double.",
      "\u201cI signed on to the movie and then I was like: How am I going to do the wrestling?\u201d says Goldenberg. \u201cI watched so many hours of him wrestling. I thought, there\u2019s no way I can do this without him doubling himself. He moves in a way that I just thought no one could ever master.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: \u201cUnstoppable\u201d is the rare sports drama to give you not just one excellent coach, but two. Because it spans Robles\u2019 wrestling career in high school and college, we first get Michael Pe\u00f1a as his most devoted supporter, and, later, Don Cheadle as his initially more skeptical coach in college.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d directed by decorated cinematographer Rachel Morrison (\u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d \u201cMudbound\u201d), is also about a real champion, the Olympic gold medal winner Claressa Shields (played by Destiny Ryan).",
      "The first half of \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d which opens Dec. 25, is somewhat conventional, albeit crafted with a keen sense of texture and the local flavor of Flint, Michigan, where Shields was from. It charts her rise as a female boxer leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Once she's won gold, you might even glance at your watch and wonder why they wrapped things up so quickly.",
      "But the film, scripted by Barry Jenkins, the \u201cMoonlight\u201d director, then turns into something else, something more interesting. Shields\u2019 glory is short-lived. No Wheaties box covers come for her. A tough Black woman in a bloody sport who makes no apologies for her interest in knocking out her opponent, is unappealing to marketers. As \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d continues in its thought-provoking third act, it asks questions less about who wins and more about who gets to be deemed \u201can American hero.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: Brian Tyree Henry plays Shields\u2019 devoted cornerman Jason Crutchfield for the duration, from her first jabs in the gym to her post-Olympics struggles. Henry, a tender and soulful actor in everything, is more of a co-star than a supporting player. Of all the coaches in these three films, he\u2019s the one you\u2019d most want cheering you on."

Almost like a plot from Hallmark's playbook, regional and community theaters are putting on a festive show. But these are gentle send-ups of the films and all their cheesy spirit.",
      "Love \u2018em or hate \u2019em, formulaic meet-cute holiday flicks have become as tied to the yuletide as ugly sweaters and hot chocolate. Theater directors say the movies have a universal appeal since most audiences can recognize the story beats. And judging by the high ticket sales, these parodies are gaining a holly jolly reception.",
      "Ghostlight Theatre, a community theater in the Phoenix suburb of Sun City West, is presenting \"The Holiday Channel Christmas Movie Wonderthon,\u201d by Don Zolidis. The story juggles six different would-be couples at the same Vermont inn.",
      "They all represent archetypes, from the movie star seeking anonymity to a Christmas-themed shop proprietor. All the female characters have holiday-ish names like Holly, Joy and Carol. In one funny twist, real-life husband and wife Michael and GinaKay Howell play one of the couples. She says the experience has been \u201cthe greatest Christmas present.\u201d Their courtship banter, however, was nothing like in the play.",
      "\u201cThere are moments where I\u2019m like, \u2018What? What are we even saying?\u2019\u201d laughed Michael, who plays the prince of a fictitious country with a \u201cBorat\u201d-like accent. \u201cIt really hit the nail on the head of everything that Hallmark stands for and then, like, makes fun of it.\"",
      "Zach Athanasakis, the director, emphasized to the 16-member cast that much of the humor depends on them saying their lines with a straight face.",
      "\u201cA lot of these lines are very, very corny and you have to be able to say it with your chest and really, truly embody how much weight that holds for the character in it \u2014 no matter how silly it is,\u201d Athanasakis said.",
      "Laura Vines, Ghostlight's executive director and co-founder, had been looking for something \u201cthat would kind of set us apart\u201d in metro Phoenix.

She's a business executive who falls for the \u201chunky lumberjack widower\u201d owner of the B&B, said the director, Dan Murphy.",

      "\u201cThe reason I wrote this is because my wife found something on YouTube, like a three-minute spoof,\" Lepard said. \"She said, \u2018You should write something like this for the theater.\u2019\u201d",

      "But the play's appeal isn't limited to Williamston. Lepard has gotten requests to license it to theaters elsewhere in Michigan, and in Texas and Colorado.

      "When Donald Trump takes office as president for a second time, many journalists anticipate a hostile climate toward them and their work",
      "NEW YORK -- For the press heading into a second Trump administration, there's a balancing act between being prepared and being fearful.",
      "The return to power of Donald Trump, who has called journalists enemies and talked about retribution against those he feels have wronged him, has news executives nervous. Perceived threats are numerous: lawsuits of every sort, efforts to unmask anonymous sources, physical danger and intimidation, attacks on public media and libel protections, day-to-day demonization.",
      "In a closely-watched case settled over the weekend, ABC chose to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the president-elect over an inaccurate statement made by George Stephanopoulos by agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library.",
      "\u201cThe news media is heading into this next administration with its eyes open,\u201d said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.",
      "\u201cSome challenges to the free press may be overt, some may be more subtle,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to be prepared for rapid response as well as long campaigns to protect our rights \u2014 and to remember that our most important audiences are the courts and the public.\u201d",
      "One prominent editor warned against going on war footing with an administration that hasn't taken office yet. \u201cThere may be a moment to cry wolf here,\u201d said Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached it.\u201d",
      "At a news conference on Monday, Trump said that \u201cwe need a fair media\u201d and discussed some potential and ongoing legal cases he has against news outlets.",
      "\u201cWe have to straighten out the press,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur press is very corrupt, almost as corrupt as our elections.\u201d",
      "News organizations are heading into the second Trump era weak both financially and in public esteem. To a large extent, Trump sidestepped legacy media outlets during his campaign in favor of podcasters, yet still had time for specific beefs against ABC, CBS and NBC.",
      "The Trump team knows that many of its followers despise a probing press, and stoking that fury has political advantages. Two examples in the campaign to install Trump nominee Pete Hegseth as defense secretary shows how routine reporting activities can be characterized as an attack.",
      "When The New York Times was tipped to an email that Hegseth's mother once sent to him criticizing his treatment of women, it called her for comment. Penelope Hegseth later told Fox News that she perceived that as a threat, even though it enabled the newspaper to report that she had quickly apologized for sending the email and says she doesn't feel that way about him now.",
      "Pete Hegseth also used social media to say that ProPublica \u2014 he called it a \u201cLeft Wing hack group\u201d \u2014 was about to knowingly publish a false report that he hadn't been accepted into West Point decades ago. The news site had contacted him after officials at the military academy contradicted Hegseth's claim of acceptance. Hegseth provided proof that those officials were mistaken, and ProPublica never published a story.",
      "\u201cThat's journalism,\u201d noted ProPublica's Jesse Eisinger. But a narrative had taken hold: \u201cProPublica's botched Pete Hegseth smear,\u201d the New York Post called it in a headline.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump sued CBS News for the way it edited an interview with opponent Kamala Harris; suggested ABC News lose its broadcast license for fact-checking him during his lone debate with Harris; and successfully called for equal time on NBC after Harris appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In the Stephanopoulos lawsuit, the ABC anchor said Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d in writer E. Jean Carroll's civil trial, when he had not.",
      "At his news conference, Trump said he was expecting to file a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register in Iowa for publishing results of a poll shortly before the election that suddenly had him behind Harris. He said that amounted to \u201cfraud and election interference.\u201d He eventually won the state handily. Spokeswoman Lark-Marie Anton says the Register stands by its reporting and believes a lawsuit would be without merit.",
      "Trump engages with the mainstream media \u2014 besides the news conference Monday he gave a newsmaking interview to NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this month \u2014 but journalists have to be alert to how their work will be portrayed.",
      "Trump's appointments, and what they've said about journalists, have raised alarms.",
      "Kash Patel, Trump's choice to lead the FBI, said on a podcast last year that \u201cwe're going to come after people in the media who lied about American citizens.\u201d Two appointees who have expressed hostility toward the media will be in a position to impact the work of journalists: Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Kari Lake as director of Voice of America.",
      "News organizations are worried that a Justice Department policy that has generally prohibited prosecutors from seizing the records of journalists in order to investigate leaks will be reversed, and are already urging journalists to protect their work. \u201cIf you have something you don't want to share with a broader audience, don't put it on the cloud,\u201d ProPublica's Engelberg said.",
      "During the first Trump administration, some journalists who covered immigration issues were pulled aside for screening and questioning. The Reporter's Committee wonders if this might happen again \u2014 and whether similar practices might extend toward reporting on expected deportations.",
      "The literary and human rights organization PEN America is concerned about journalists facing physical danger and digital hostility. It may have seemed like a flippant remark to some of his supporters when Trump, months after an attempt on his life, said at a rally that he wouldn't mind if somebody had to \u201cshoot through the fake news\u201d to get to him. But it wasn't for people standing on media risers.",
      "\u201cIt's important that the president act with responsibility to reduce physical violence against the press rather than encourage it,\u201d said Viktorya Vilk, PEN America's program director for digital safety and free expression.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana recently introduced a bill that would end taxpayer funding for public radio and television, a longtime goal of many Republicans that may get momentum with the party back in power. Some U.S. Supreme Court justices are eager to revisit a legal precedent that has made it difficult to prove defamation against news organizations.",
      "It's apparent that the new administration will come after the press in every conceivable way, former Washington Post editor Martin Baron said recently on NPR. \u201cI do think he will use every tool in his toolbox,\u201d Baron said, \u201cand there are a lot of tools.\u201d",
      "In their most pessimistic moments, advocates for the press look at what has happened in Hungary under the control of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Since Orban took control in 2010, he and his supporters have taken control of most media and turned it into a propaganda arm.",
      "Don't think that can't happen in the United States, warns Andras Petho, an investigative journalist in Hungary who left a news website when it was pressured to stifle his work, and started the investigative journalism center Direkt36.",
      "Despite repression, there is still a market for independent journalism in Hungary, he said. Earlier this year, two Hungarian officials resigned following an outcry when it was revealed that they had pardoned a man who had forced children to retract sexual abuse claims made against the director of a government-run facility.",
      "Petho said it is important for journalists not to portray themselves as any sort of resistance, because that makes it easier for the government to dismiss them. Instead, they should just do the work.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we all have to accept and admit that our power as media has declined,\u201d said Petho, who participated in the Nieman fellowship for journalists at Harvard University. \u201cOur stories don't have the same impact that they had a decade ago. But I wouldn't underestimate the power of the news media, either.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Popeye the Sailor and the Belgian boy reporter Tintin lead the class of characters and works of art becoming public domain in 2025",
      "Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.",
      "This year\u2019s crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year\u2019s entrance of Mickey Mouse into the public domain. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons \u2014 he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke\u2019s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \u201cThere are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at this year\u2019s crop.",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \u201cThimble Theater\u201d in 1929, speaking his first words, \u201c\u2019Ja think I\u2019m a cowboy?\u201d when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \u201dPopeye.\u201d",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength was not there from the start, and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn\u2019t begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman\u2019s 1980 film, starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAdventures of Tintin\u201d in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors \u2014 including Tintin\u2019s red hair \u2014 didn\u2019t appear until years later, and could, like Popeye\u2019s spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won\u2019t become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d arguably William Faulkner\u2019s quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family\u2019s ruin in the author\u2019s native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner\u2019s Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d joins his earlier \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway\u2019s status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck\u2019s first novel, \u201cA Cup of Gold,\u201d from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \u201cPsycho,\u201d and \u201cVertigo,\u201d Alfred Hitchcock made \u201cBlackmail\u201d in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the UK\u2019s \u2014 and Hitchcock\u2019s \u2014 first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film\u2019s most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929\u2019s \u201cThe Black Watch,\u201d an adventure epic that includes Ford\u2019s future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \u201cDynamite.\u201d",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929\u2019s \u201cThe Cocoanuts,\u201d a forerunner to future classics like \u201cAnimal Crackers\u201d and \u201cDuck Soup.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Broadway Melody,\u201d the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture \u2014 known as \u201coutstanding production\u201d at the time \u2014 will also become public, though it\u2019s often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \u201cThe Karnival Kid,\u201d where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter\u2019s compositions \u201cWhat Is This Thing Called Love?\u201d and \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \u201cAin\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019, written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \u201cThe Hollywood Revue\u201d and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \u201cNobody Knows the Trouble I\u2019ve Seen\u201d from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d performed by its composer George Gershwin."

      "Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music.",

      "The son of legendary tabla artist Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he was touring by age 12 and performing alongside India\u2019s classical music legends during his teens.",
      "In an interview that was shared widely on social media in India, Hussain says his father welcomed him into the world after he was born by speaking tabla rhythms into his ears.",
      "\u201cI was brought home, handed over to my dad in his arms. The tradition was that the father is supposed to recite a prayer in the baby\u2019s ear ...

      "Kane Brown's fourth studio album, \u201cThe High Road,\u201d is his favorite to date, the country superstar tells The Associated Press in an exclusive interview",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kane Brown is in his new home studio just outside Nashville, preparing to have the first sit-down conversation about his fourth studio album, \u201cThe High Road.\u201d It's a fitting title, because pounding the pavement is something he's more than familiar with. A few short days ago, he was in Los Angeles, performing at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball alongside an eclectic mix of the biggest performers \u2014 SZA, Tate McRae, Madison Beer, T-Pain, Paris Hilton and K-pop group NCT Dream among them.",
      "To the untrained ear, it might seem unusual pairing \u2014 one of the great modern country voices alongside pop acts. But genre-mixing? That's something Brown knows a little bit about, too.",
      "Country is at the heart of everything he does \u2014 the genre's narrative style, fiddles, slide guitar and Brown's signature twang carry throughout \u2014 but \u201cThe High Road\u201d isn't afraid to play with different sounds. He says he's \u201calways been kind of nervous to push boundaries and do certain things. But I\u2019ve been here for almost a decade now, so I needed to stop hiding and just do what I love to do. And country is always my number one.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is by far my favorite album, from the sequencing to the songwriting to the different sounds. There\u2019s definitely a song for everybody,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy other albums, I always kind of, you know, cared what people thought about. And this album, we don\u2019t... we gave our everything into the songs.\u201d",
      "He's also no stranger to working with a variety of artists, from regional Mexican country superstar Carin Le\u00f3n on \u201cThe One (Pero No Como Yo),\u201d which released earlier this year, to 2019's \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d with EDM giant Marshmello. The helmet-wearing DJ is back on \u201cThe High Road,\u201d with the radio smash \u201cMiles On It.\u201d",
      "This album, which will be released Jan. 24, includes more features than any other in Brown\u2019s discography, including tracks with Khalid, Jelly Roll, and the legendary Brad Paisley.",
      "They came about naturally: Khalid expressed interest in wanting to go country, Brown helped him make it happen. For the Paisley track \u201cThings We Quit,\u201d Brown shared a video of him singing it on social media, and \u201ca lot of people said, \u2018This sounds like a Brad Paisley song,'\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAnd it's kind of a comedy country song, a little bit, so he was perfect for that.\u201d",
      "And as for Jelly Roll, on the song \u201cHaunted\u201d? That one was written while Brown was staying in a hotel in Manchester, England.",
      "\u201cIt was this big hotel, and I had the suite, which was a bank vault. So, the bank vault was actually in my room and there were these, like, old paintings on the wall. And we wrote three or four songs that day and we couldn\u2019t think of a song title. And I was like, \u2018This is place is haunted,\u2019\" he recalls. \"Let's write a song called \u2018Haunted,\u2019 about depression and all that. So, I mean, it actually, it came out really quick and, you know, it\u2019s meaningful to me. So hopefully it\u2019ll be meaningful to a lot of other people.\u201d",
      "Jelly Roll has never been one to veer away from topics of mental health, and he made the ideal collaborator. \u201cThat song is so him,\u201d Brown says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think that I was going to release it, so he was trying to keep it for himself. So that told me that the song meant even more to him than what I thought it was going to mean.\u201d",
      "Important to Brown, no doubt, are two new duets with his wife Katelyn, following the success of their 2023's single \u201cThank God.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur music is about telling our story,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "There's the R&B-pop of \u201cBody Talk,\u201d and a traditionalist's country tune in \u201cDo Us Apart\" \u2014 pulling from a long tradition of country music greats performing with their partners. The latter should come as no surprise. \u201cOur favorite duet to sing together is Randy Travis and Carrie Underwood's \u201cI Told You So,\u201d so we\u2019ve always wanted to have that type of song,\" he says.",
      "And country songs, he's got a lot of them: the jukebox \u201cFiddle in the Band,\u201d the slow-burn \u201cBackseat Driver,\u201d the barstool swaying of \u201cSays I Can.\u201d",
      "Or the closer, \u201c'When You Forget,' a song that I wrote about my granddad with Alzheimer's. To me, that's \u201890s country song storytelling,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's keep the tradition there \u2014 and then I go far left with some other songs.\u201d",
      "On \u201cThe High Road,\u201d Brown believes each track tells a story \u2014 and he looks forward to sharing them, both through the record and on a North American tour next spring.",

      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "The settlement agreement was signed Friday, the same day a Florida federal judge ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for separate depositions in the case next week. The settlement means that sworn testimony is no longer required.",
      "The agreement bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",

      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",

      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "Cooper will leave office at the end of the year because of term limits.",
      "Despite opposition in the GOP-controlled General Assembly for several years, Medicaid expansion in North Carolina passed with bipartisan support last year after Congress offered states more financial incentives to join the program. The federal government foots 90% of the expansion costs under the program.",
      "In just the first few weeks of the program's rollout, the state had 300,000 North Carolinians \u2014 half of its goal \u2014 enroll in Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is part of a handful of Southern states that now participate in the program.",
      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

      "A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby says he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution\u2019s leading expert changed his opinion on how three infants died",
      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",
      "An inquiry currently underway to examine failures by the hospital to recognize why babies were dying and why they took so long to stop Letby opened in September against a backdrop of experts and others who have questioned evidence used against Letby.",
      "A group of scientists, doctors and legal experts that independently reviewed scientific evidence from Letby\u2019s trial warned Britain\u2019s ministers of health and justice that legal systems were \u201cparticularly vulnerable to errors\u201d when dealing with technical matters, \u201cespecially in cases involving statistical anomalies in health care settings.\u201d",
      "Evans gave his new opinions on the death of infants identified in court as Baby C, Baby I and Baby P in a signed response to a Channel 5 documentary, McDonald said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure Dr. Evans is still going to say that Lucy Letby is guilty and he has a different view or different hypothesis in relation to it,\" McDonald said. \u201cBut the cause of death that was before the Court of Appeal is different now, according to Dr. Evans, and I think that is a profound issue that needs to be relooked at.\u201d",
      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said."

      "You could be suffering from a case of the holiday blues, which experts say is not uncommon.",
      "A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cA lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,\u201d said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling.",
      "\"You\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.",
      "Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the holidays, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.",
      "\u201cCertainly this year, I think with the recent election, there\u2019s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you\u2019re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can bring up strong emotions.\u201d",
      "Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?",
      "It\u2019s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event \u2014 and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.",
      "And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.",
      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",
      "During her first sober holiday season last year, Haydel reveled in meaningful conversations and the joy of waking up feeling good each morning with clear memories of the night before.",
      "\u201cSobriety is the gift that you keep on giving to your future self over and over and over again,\u201d says Eliott Edge, who manages Hekate, the sober bar.",
      "Focus on enjoying this very real gift, Baily says. Take your time getting dressed, visualizing yourself having a great time, and imagine how you\u2019ll feel as your head hits the pillow when you get home.",
      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best bits of the evening,\u201d Baily says, \u201cand there are no costs.\u201d"

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

    "story": [
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.",
      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "The day after a masked gunman killed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City, police in San Francisco gave the FBI a potentially valuable tip about the identity of the suspect",
      "NEW YORK -- The day after a masked gunman killed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City, police in San Francisco gave the FBI a potentially valuable tip about the identity of the suspect: He looked like a man who had been reported missing to them the previous month, Luigi Mangione.",
      "San Francisco police provided Mangione\u2019s name to the FBI on Dec. 5, according to a law enforcement official was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "That was the day the NYPD released surveillance images showing the face of the suspected shooter as he checked into a Manhattan hostel.",
      "\u201cAmong multiple tips received by FBI New York from the public and law enforcement regarding the homicide in Midtown Manhattan on December 4, 2024, a tip was received from the San Francisco Police Department regarding the possible identity of the suspect,\u201d the FBI confirmed in a statement Friday.",
      "The FBI statement didn\u2019t provide further detail about the nature of the tip or say when it was received but said agents in New York had \u201cconducted routine investigative activity and referred this and other leads to the New York City Police Department.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested Monday, Dec. 9, after an employee at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, phoned police saying that there was a person eating breakfast in the restaurant who looked like the person being sought as the gunman.",
      "The NYPD's chief of detectives, Joseph Kenny, said at the time that the department's investigators didn't have Mangione's name until he turned up in that McDonald's.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the NYPD Friday.",
      "The San Francisco department's tip to the FBI was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was ambushed and fatally shot outside a hotel where his company was holding its annual investor conference.",
      "The leader of the insurer's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, described Thompson as kind and brilliant Friday in a guest essay published in The New York Times.",
      "UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty conceded that the patchwork U.S. health system \u201cdoes not work as well as it should\u201d but said Thompson cared about customers and was working to make it better.",
      "The killing has been viewed as a violent expression of widespread anger at the insurance industry. Witty said people in the company were struggling to make sense of the killing, as well as the vitriol and threats directed at colleagues.",
      "Police have said that Mangione was found with a gun that matched shell casings found at the scene of the shooting and a three-page letter in which he lamented the high cost of health care in the U.S. and singled out UnitedHealthcare for its profits and size. The company, a division of UnitedHealth Group, is the largest U.S. health insurer. Mangione is currently being held in Pennsylvania and intends to plead not guilty to a murder charge in New York, his lawyer has said.",
      "Witty said he understood people's frustration but described Thompson as part of the solution.",
      "Thompson never forgot growing up in his family's farmhouse in Iowa and focused on improving the experiences of consumers.",
      "\u201cHis dad spent more than 40 years unloading trucks at grain elevators. B.T., as we knew him, worked farm jobs as a kid and fished at a gravel pit with his brother. He never forgot where he came from, because it was the needs of people who live in places like Jewell, Iowa, that he considered first in finding ways to improve care,\u201d Witty wrote.",
      "Witty said his company shares some responsibility for lack of understanding of coverage decisions.",
      "\"We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people\u2019s frustrations with it. No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It\u2019s a patchwork built over decades,\u201d Witty wrote. \u201cOur mission is to help make it work better.\u201d",
      "He said it was unfair that the company's workers had been barraged with threats, even as they grieved the loss of a colleague.",
      "\u201cNo employees \u2014 be they the people who answer customer calls or nurses who visit patients in their homes \u2014 should have to fear for their and their loved ones\u2019 safety,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A woman in Lakeland, Florida, was charged this week with threatening a worker at her own health insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield, during a phone call. Police said she cited words Thompson\u2019s killer wrote on shell casings and said \u201cyou people are next\u201d during the recorded call.",
      "Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel, where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing on a bicycle.",
      "Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him to New York so he can face a murder charge in Thompson\u2019s killing."

      "Briana Boston, 42, told a representative of Blue Cross Blue Shield, \u201cDelay, deny, depose. You people are next\u201d as they ended a phone call Tuesday in which she unsuccessfully challenged the company's denial of her insurance claim, Lakeland police say a recording shows.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the casings left at the scene of the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City street on Dec. 4. The words reflect the \u201cdelay, deny, defend\u201d strategy some insurance companies use in dealing with expensive claims: Delay the decision, deny the claim and aggressively defend themselves.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, is charged with murder in Thompson's killing.",
      "According to police, when Boston was questioned by officers Wednesday, she told them she used the words because \u201cit is what is in the news right now.\u201d She told officers she owns no guns and is accused of adding that insurance companies \u201care evil\u201d and \u201cdeserve karma.\u201d",
      "Boston was arrested and charged with threatening to conduct an act of terrorism. She was being held without bail Friday at the Polk County jail. Court records do not show whether she has an attorney, and a phone listing at her home address was disconnected.",
      "The charge is a second-degree felony, which could be punished by up to 15 years in prison if she is convicted."

    "summary": "McKinsey &amp; Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work for opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according to court papers filed in Virginia",
    "story": [
      "McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work for opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according to court papers filed in Virginia",
      "BOSTON -- McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin, according to court papers filed in Virginia on Friday.",
      "As part of the deal with the U.S. Justice Department, McKinsey will avoid prosecution on criminal charges if it pays the sum and follows certain conditions for five years, including ceasing any work on the sale, marketing or promotion of controlled substances.",
      "A former McKinsey senior partner, Martin Elling, has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for deleting documents from his laptop after he became aware of investigations into Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin that was then a client, according to the filings. A lawyer for Elling declined to comment Friday.",
      "McKinsey said in a statement on Friday that it's \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for its work for Purdue Pharma.",
      "\u201cWe should have appreciated the harm opioids were causing in our society and we should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret for our firm.\u201d",
      "It's the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold accountable companies officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of them have been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis.",
      "Purdue paid McKinsey more than $93 million over 15 years for several products, including how to improve revenue from OxyContin. Prosecutors say McKinsey \u201cknew the risk and dangers\u201d of OxyContin and knew that Purdue Pharma executives had previously pleaded guilty to crimes related to the promotion of the drug, but decided to work with the opioid manufacturer anyway.",
      "One of the jobs for McKinsey, the papers said, was to identify which prescribers would generate the most additional prescriptions if Purdue salespeople focused on that. That resulted in prescriptions that \u201cwere not for a medically accepted indication, were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d the filing said.",
      "\u201cThis was not hypothetical,\" Christopher Kavanaugh, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said in a news conference in Boston on Friday. \u201cThis was not just marketing. It was a strategy. It was executed and it worked.\u201d",
      "During work to \u201cturbocharge\u201d Purdue sales in 2013 after a drop in business, McKinsey consultants accompanied Purdue sales representatives on visits to prescribers and pharmacies to gather information. In a note about one ride-along, a McKinsey consultant said one pharmacist had a gun \u201cand was shaking; abuse is definitely a huge issue.\u201d The company continued looking for ways to increase OxyContin sales, according to court papers.",
      "In 2014, McKinsey identified some small clinics that were writing more opioid prescriptions than entire hospital systems \u2014 and suggested they be targeted for more sales, the court filing said.",
      "The company also tried to help Purdue get a say in shaping federal rules intended to ensure the benefits of addictive prescription drugs outweighed the risks. The government said in its new filings that that resulted in making high-dose OxyContin subject to the same oversight as lower-dose opioids and made training for prescribers voluntary rather than mandatory.",
      "Since 2021, McKinsey has agreed to pay state and local governments about $765 million in settlements for its role in advising businesses on how to sell more of the powerful prescription painkillers amid a national opioid crisis.",
      "The firm also agreed last year to pay health care funds and insurance companies $78 million.",
      "Federal authorities say the deal represents the first time a management consulting firm is being held accountable like this for advising a client to break the law.",
      "\u201cIf a consulting first conspires with a client to engage in criminal conduct, the fact that you\u2019re an outside consultant will not protect you,\u201d said Joshua Levy, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts.",
      "Some advocates say the opioid crisis was touched off when Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin hit the market in 1996.",
      "Three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to misbranding charges in 2007 and the company agreed to pay a fine. The company pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2020 and agreed to $8.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures \u2014 most of which will be waived as long as it executes a settlement through bankruptcy court that is still in the works.",

      "Specially trained miniature horses visit hospital wards and residential care homes in the Greek capital, providing pet therapy to sick and disabled children and adults",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of nine tiny equines from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the horses, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of nine equines \u2014 the six American miniature horses, one that was later born in Greece, and two rescued ponies - Billy the Shetland pony and Giselle who was rescued from the island of Santorini.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",
      "Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. \u201cI\u2019m making super-human efforts,\u201d said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program\u2019s continuity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",
      "Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can.",
      "During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the reactions. It\u2019s like something awakens their senses,\u201d said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki.",
      "The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, \u201cis very important for us. Especially when it\u2019s spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn\u2019t instigated by us,\u201d Volikaki said.",
      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the (horses) get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",

      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",

      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",
      "He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month backpacking trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found \u201cthe perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",

      "In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Donald Trump weighs in on Jan. 6 pardons, immigration issues and world affairs",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was on the verge of backing a 16-week federal abortion ban earlier this year when aides staged an intervention.",
      "According to Time magazine's cover story on his selection as its 2024 Person of the Year, Trump's aides first raised concerns in mid-March that the abortion cutoff being pushed by some allies would be stricter than existing law in numerous states. It was seen as a potential political liability amid ongoing fallout over the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that includes three justices nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "Trump political director James Blair went to work assembling a slide deck \u2014 eventually titled \u201cHow a national abortion ban will cost Trump the election\" \u2014 that argued a 16-week ban would hurt the Republican candidate in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the magazine reported.",
      "\u201cAfter flipping through Blair\u2019s presentation\" on a flight to a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in April, Trump dropped the idea, according to the report. \"So we leave it to the states, right?\" Trump was quoted as saying. He soon released a video articulating that position.",
      "At the time, Trump\u2019s campaign denied that he was considering supporting the 16-week ban, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and saying Trump planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House.",
      "Here are other highlights from the story and the president-elect's 65-minute interview with the magazine:",
      "Trump reaffirmed his plans to pardon most of those convicted for their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would look at individuals on a \u201ccase-by-case\" basis, but that \u201ca vast majority of them should not be in jail.\u201d",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump insisted he has the authority to use the military to assist with his promised mass deportations, even though, as his interviewers noted, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military in domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help.\"",
      "Trump did not deny that camps would be needed to hold detained migrants as they are processed for deportation.",
      "\u201cWhatever it takes to get them out. I don\u2019t care,\" he said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not going to need too many because I want to get them out and I don\u2019t want them sitting in camp for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Trump told Time he does not plan to restore the policy of separating children from their families to deter border crossings, but he did not rule it out. The practice led to thousands of children being separated from their parents and was condemned around the globe as inhumane.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have to because we will send the whole family back,\u201d he said. \u201cI would much rather deport them together, yes, than separate.\u201d",
      "Trump dismissed the idea that Elon Musk will face conflicts of interest as he takes the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group that Trump has selected him to lead. The panel is supposed to find waste and cut regulations, including many that could affect Musk's wide-ranging interests, which include electric cars, rockets and telecommunications.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\" Trump said. \u201cI think that Elon puts the country long before his company. ... He considers this to be his most important project.\"",
      "Trump lowered expectations about his ability to drive down grocery prices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to bring them down. It\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up. You know, it\u2019s very hard. But I think that they will,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said he is planning \u201ca virtual closure\" of the \"Department of Education in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to need some people just to make sure they\u2019re teaching English in the schools,\" he said. \u201cBut we want to move education back to the states.\u201d",
      "Yet Trump has proposed exerting enormous influence over schools. He has threatened to cut funding for schools with vaccine mandates while forcing them to \u201cteach students to love their country\" and promote \u201cthe nuclear family,\u201d including \u201cthe roles of mothers and fathers\u201d and the \u201cthings that make men and women different and unique.\u201d",
      "Asked to clarify whether he was committed to preventing the Food and Drug Administration from stripping access to abortion pills, Trump replied, \u201cIt\u2019s always been my commitment.\u201d",
      "But Trump has offered numerous conflicting stances on the issue, including to Time.",
      "Earlier in the interview, he was asked whether he would promise that his FDA would not do anything to limit access to medication abortion or abortion pills. \"We\u2019re going to take a look at all of that,\u201d he said, before calling the prospect \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve stated it very clearly and I just stated it again very clearly. I think it would be highly unlikely. I can\u2019t imagine, but with, you know, we\u2019re looking at everything, but highly unlikely. I guess I could say probably as close to ruling it out as possible, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to do anything now.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would abandon Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia's invasion, Trump said he would use U.S. support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow in negotiating an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI want to reach an agreement,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way you\u2019re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.\u201d",
      "Trump would not commit to supporting a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, as he had previously.",
      "\u201cI support whatever solution we can do to get peace,\" he said. \"There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can\u2019t go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he trusted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",
      "Trump would not rule out the possibility of war with Iran during his second term. \u201cAnything can happen. It\u2019s a very volatile situation,\" he said.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Nov. 5 election, Trump continued to play coy: \"I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s just inappropriate.\u201d",
      "Trump insisted that his bid to install Matt Gaetz as attorney general \u201dwasn\u2019t blocked. I had the votes (in the Senate) if I needed them, but I had to work very hard.\u201d",
      "When the scope of resistance to the former Republican congressman from Florida became clear, Trump said, \u201cI talked to him, and I said, \u2018You know, Matt, I don\u2019t think this is worth the fight.'\"",
      "Gaetz pulled out amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations, and Trump tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the Cabinet post.",
      "Trump, who has named anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, did not rule out the possibility of eliminating some childhood vaccinations even though they have been proved safe in extensive studies and real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades and are considered among the most effective public health measures in modern history.",
      "Pressed on whether \u201cgetting rid of some vaccinations\u201d \u2014 neither Trump nor the interviewers specified which ones \u2014 might be part of the plan to improve the health of the country, Trump responded: \u201cIt could if I think it\u2019s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very controversial in the end.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there could be, yeah,\" Trump said of the prospect of others in his family continuing in his footsteps.",
      "He pointed to daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who served as co-chair of the Republican National Committee and is now being talked about as a potential replacement for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Trump has chosen for secretary of state.",
      "Trump said the former and soon-to-be first lady Melania Trump will be joining him at the White House during second term and will \"be active, when she needs to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh yes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very beloved by the people, Melania. And they like the fact that she\u2019s not out there in your face all the time for many reasons.\u201d"

      "The French military said it is sending four to five planes a day with up to 50 tons of assistance, including food, water and medicine. Hundreds of military personnel have arrived in Mayotte since the weekend.",

      "\u201cThe priority today is water and food,\u201d Soumaila told RFI radio, adding that \"there are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem.",

      "Speaking on France Inter radio Tuesday morning, Mayotte lawmaker Estelle Youssouffa described the challenges in accounting for victims, especially among undocumented migrants.",
      "\u201cThe real toll of those swept away by the mud, winds and tin from shanty towns will never be known,\u201d Youssouffa said. \u201cThis population, by definition undocumented migrants, are the main victims of this tragedy because they feared going to shelters.\u201d",
      "Youssouffa shared a harrowing account from an imam she spoke to on Monday, who reported burying more than 30 people in a single day in La Vigie, a makeshift settlement.",

      "Aid efforts continue, with French military aircraft delivering water and food daily. However, power outages and communication disruptions persist, leaving many without basic necessities. The island\u2019s main hospital remains severely damaged, and a field hospital is expected to arrive Thursday.",

      "A controversial legislation submitted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to change India\u2019s voting system has failed to pass Tuesday in the country\u2019s lower house of Parliament",
      "NEW DELHI -- A controversial legislation submitted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to change India's voting system failed to pass Tuesday in the country's lower house of Parliament.",
      "Law minister, Arjun Ram Meghwal, presented the legislation which proposed allowing elections for state assemblies and the national parliament to be held simultaneously. However, it was not approved as the vote fell short of the required two-thirds majority; only 269 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal while 198 were against it.",
      "The government says simultaneous polls will result in higher economic growth and pave the way for better governance as they will reduce the frequency of election campaigns and expenses and allow politicians to focus on their work.",
      "However, India\u2019s opposition has strongly objected to the legislation, which has been under review for over a year. Critics say the proposed system will undermine federalism and risks shifting India toward a presidential election model and could give unfair poll advantage to the governing parties at the federal level in state elections.",
      "The South Asian country of more than 1.4 billion people has 28 states and eight federal territories. Currently, staggered state and parliamentary elections are held at different times across India, with few state polls scheduled almost every year.",
      "India\u2019s last national election was held in seven phases over 44 days.",
      "Meghwal said on Tuesday the government was willing to send the legislation to a parliamentary committee for wider consultation.",
      "As per the draft, the legislation if approved as a law can be put into action in \u201cthe first sitting\u201d of the lower house of the parliament after a national election \u2014 which implies it can\u2019t be implemented until 2029 when the current government's term ends.",
      "Modi\u2019s government has long advocated for the proposed system and appointed a nine-member panel last year to look into whether it was feasible. The panel recommended the plan in March, saying it would help reduce wasting public funds and increase voter turnout.",
      "The legislation must be approved by both houses of the parliament by a two-thirds majority in each before it becomes law. The new system, if approved, would also require amendments to India\u2019s Constitution and approval from all states and federal territories, experts say.",
      "Unlike its two previous terms, Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party does not have a majority in the lower house of the parliament and banks on its partners from the National Democratic Alliance and friendly parties to get laws passed."

I have high expectations for whether there is peace, tension, or development across the strait. I think there should be more ... lights on fishing boats at dawn and less noise of (war) ships and (war) planes.\u201d",
      "Between Monday and Tuesday, China sent 10 military aircraft and seven aircraft toward Taiwan, according to Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry. Four of the aircraft crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that forms an unofficial border between the sides.",

      "Faced with China's massive military, Taiwan has been upgrading its defenses with latest version F-16 fighter jets, missiles, submarines and artillery. On Monday, Taiwan began unloading 38 U.S.-made M1A2T tanks that represent a quantum leap in Taiwan's outdated land defenses. A further 42 of the tanks are due to be delivered next year, and at least 28 the year after.",

      "South Korea\u2019s acting leader has vowed to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament\u2019s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s acting leader vowed Tuesday to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament\u2019s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, as rival parties squabble the appointments of court justices who will determine whether to unseat or reinstate Yoon.",
      "The country\u2019s liberal opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law imposition, suspending Yoon\u2019s presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether he can stay in office. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within two months.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting leader, has taken steps to reassure the U.S. and other countries and stabilize markets. Presiding over a Cabinet Council meeting on Tuesday, Han said he will \u201ccontinuously do my utmost to inform the international society that the Republic of Korea is fast regaining stability and maintaining confidence with partners.\u201d",
      "But the country\u2019s intense political strife appears to be far from over, as rival parties began bickering over whether to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, the nine-member court panel needs support from at least six justices. But since three seats remain vacant following retirements, a unanimous decision in favor of Yoon\u2019s impeachment is required to throw him out of office.",
      "Three of the court\u2019s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three others are nominated by the Supreme Court head and another three by the National Assembly, before they are formally appointed by the president in what is widely considered a procedural matter. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by the National Assembly \u2014 two by the Democratic Party and the other by Yoon\u2019s ruling People Power Party.",
      "The court can rule on Yoon\u2019s case with only the current six justices. But the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led the impeachment efforts against Yoon, has said it will speed up the process of restoring the court to its full capacity to promote fairness and public confidence in its ruling.",
      "PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, created a stir Tuesday as he voiced his objection to the push to fill the three vacancies. He said it would be inappropriate for Han, the acting leader, to appoint justices nominated by parliament, saying such authority solely rests with the president.",
      "\u201cAn acting president can appoint Constitutional Court justices when there is a presidential vacancy, but not when the president\u2019s duties are just suspended,\u201d Kweon said.",
      "Many observers say the court\u2019s current six-member configuration is advantageous for Yoon\u2019s chances to return to office, as it would only require a single justice rejecting the parliament's impeachment. They note that Cheong Hyungsik, one of the six justices, is a clear conservative who was directly appointed by Yoon.",
      "The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Kweon\u2019s argument as \u201cabsurd and utterly nonsensical\u201d and urged PPP to abide by a November agreement between the parties to nominate the three Constitutional Court justices.",
      "Party lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said PPP has \u201cblatantly revealed their true intention to obstruct the constitutional trial.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate response from Han, who during the Cabinet meeting stressed that the government will cooperate with the ruling and opposition parties to stabilize the economy.",
      "There is no clear definition about what an acting president can and cannot do over the appointments of the court\u2019s justices. But some experts say Han is allowed to appoint the three remaining justices nominated by parliament, as there\u2019s no legal provision preventing him from doing so.",
      "Kim Jung-won, the Constitutional Court\u2019s secretary general, told the parliament on Tuesday that the court believes the acting president can exercise the right to appoint justices.",
      "The Democratic Party accuses PPP of trying to drag out the impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which has up to 180 days to determine Yoon\u2019s fate.",
      "Time is a crucial issue for Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is favored by polls to win a presidential election in the event of Yoon\u2019s ouster but grapples with his own legal troubles. Lee could possibly be prohibited from running for president if the appellate and Supreme courts uphold his lower court conviction for election law violation in November.",
      "Yoon faces allegations of rebellion and abuse of power over his martial law introduction. Investigative authorities want him to appear for questioning later this week, but officials at Yoon\u2019s office and residence on Monday refused to receive requests for his appearance.",
      "The martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, drew hundreds of troops who tried to encircle parliament and prevent lawmakers from voting on the decree. Many lawmakers still managed to get inside a National Assembly chamber and voted to overturn Yoon\u2019s decree unanimously, forcing Yoon\u2019s Cabinet to lift it.",
      "Yoon\u2019s decree, which harkened back to an era of past military-backed dictatorships, has sparked massive street protests calling for his ouster and resulted in his approval rating plummeting. Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have been arrested over their roles in the martial law enforcement.",
      "Supporters of Yoon worry that his early exit would severely hamper the country\u2019s conservatives and cause them to likely lose a presidential by-election to the liberals, like they did in 2017, when then-impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye was ousted and arrested over a corruption scandal."

      "Advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across Ukraine's military",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The concert took place in an old movie studio in Kyiv, the location kept secret until the final moment in case it was the target of a Russian attack.",
      "More than 1,000 soldiers and young people gathered to listen to the artists who joined forces with a military brigade in an innovative effort to raise funds for Ukraine\u2019s embattled troops.",
      "This was the first and only live performance of the charity album \u201cEpoch,\u201d a collaboration between the 3rd Assault Brigade and eight Ukrainian bands.",
      "The project\u2019s ambitious target is to raise 50 million hryvnias (about $1.2 million) to buy an M113 armored personnel carrier to help get infantry to the front and evacuate the wounded for medical treatment. Since it launched on streaming platforms a month ago, the initiative has raised 9 million hryvnias (around $214,000).",
      "Grassroots fundraising for Ukrainian fighters dates back to 2014, the year Russia first annexed the southern region of Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in eastern Ukraine. At that time, Ukraine\u2019s defense was made up of a regular army supported by volunteer battalions who weren't financially supported by Kyiv\u2019s government. Self-funding was critical.",
      "Now, advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across the military. By scanning a QR code, people can help buy anything from body warmers and drones to armored cars for soldiers defending the nearly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",
      "But some charities are seeing a decline in individual donations in part because of the economic situation in the country.",
      "Oleksandr Borodyn, one of the project's organizers, says the idea for the collaboration came from the challenge of continuing to drum up funds to support troops as the war is on the cusp of marking a three-year milestone.",
      "\u201cTo raise the same amount of money as at the beginning of the war, you need much more effort. That\u2019s why we came up with the idea that a musician could donate his or her art, and that art would earn money for the army,\u201d said Borodyn, a press officer for the 3rd Assault Brigade.",
      "The initiative comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before Washington's support for Kyiv\u2019s defenses is thrown into question when Donald Trump takes office next month.",
      "Monobank, one of the largest platforms to process donations, says that in the first 1,000 days of war, nearly 10.5 million unique users made donations totaling around 77 billion hryvnias (about $1.8 billion) to various fundraising organizations.",
      "But some charity groups are finding that voluntary funding isn't what it was in the first year of the full-scale invasion. The Come Back Alive foundation supports troops with anything from military training to buying drones and electronic warfare to repel attacks. In the first year of the conflict, they raised more than 5.7 billion hryvnias ($184 million). So far in 2024, the figure is nearly 3.6 billion hryvnias ($89 million).",
      "\u201cMany people report a worsening financial situation, which limits their ability to contribute to supporting the military,\u201d said Oleh Karpenko, deputy director of the Come Back Alive Foundation.",
      "Three years of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine\u2019s economy. According to a World Bank report released in May, the number of Ukrainians living in poverty has grown by 1.8 million since 2020 to about 9 million, or 29% of the population.",
      "To help the most vulnerable, the government launched a winter support program at the beginning of December and within days, around 6.5 million people had applied to receive the one off 1,000 hryvnia ($24) payment to help cover utilities, medical services and cellphone costs.",
      "According to Karpenko, local initiatives and smaller-scale fundraising efforts mean many people direct their contributions toward helping specific soldiers or military units they know personally. That reduces the amount received by larger organizations, which he says can promptly address urgent battlefield needs that the government can't meet.",
      "\u201cInternational support also plays a significant role in donation levels,\" Karpenko said. \"When aid from international partners decreases, it strongly demotivates Ukrainian society. People lose motivation to donate when they perceive a lack of willingness from partners to actively supply weapons.\u201d",
      "Staring up at the large monitors set up on either side of the stage in the form of the three diagonal line symbol of the 3rd Assault Brigade, 26-year-old Oksana Kalenchenko thinks that events like the concert are hugely important in continuing to generate support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to somebody that there is a war going on in Ukraine, let\u2019s keep donating, let\u2019s keep doing everything we can,\u201d Kalenchenko said.",
      "The collaboration album features young artists from Ukraine\u2019s rock, rap and alternative scene, and many of the lyrics reflect events and the reality of living through the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe want to show the reflection of contemporary artists to the situation in Ukraine, and in general to Ukraine at war \u2026 That\u2019s why the project is called \u2018Epoch,\u2019 because it is a transmission of the era we are living in,\u201d Borodyn said.",
      "What also unites all the songs is language. Since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukrainian music has experienced somewhat of a revival with many artists shunning the traditional Russian pop scene that dominated the post-Soviet era.",
      "\u201cPeople did not pay attention to Ukrainian music in such a large number,\u201d says Iryna Panchuk, singer and songwriter for \u201cRenie Cares,\u201d one of the bands on the album. \u201cThis is separation, because this is what makes us different from Russia and this needs to be emphasized very strongly \u2014 emphasized and strengthened,\u201d she added.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation as the injured began arriving at a hospital and unconfirmed reports of casualties emerged.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "The earthquake happened at just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that is home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down. In the first official information published on social media, the Geohazards Department said its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages.",
      "Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours \u2014 and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again. No confirmed reports of damage or casualties were provided, but accounts detailing widespread destruction filtered out on social media and in interviews.",
      "Dan McGarry, a journalist based in Port Vila, told The Associated Press he heard of one death from a police officer outside Vila Central Hospital. McGarry saw three people on gurneys \u201cin obvious distress,\u201d he said.",
      "Doctors were working \u201cas fast as they could\u201d at a triage center outside the emergency ward, he added. But the nation is not equipped for a mass casualty event, McGarry said.",
      "Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital. Phone numbers for the police, the hospital and other public agencies did not connect.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "Elsewhere, a building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila \u2014 including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand \u2014 was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said. But there were no reports of embassy staff unaccounted for.",
      "The U.S. Embassy's Facebook page said all staff were safe, but the building was closed until further notice. The office had only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence in order to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "Australia's foreign ministry also said its workers were safe.",
      "A video on social media showed the building with some damage to its structure, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground. Other photos and videos showed items and shelves that had tumbled to the floors of shops and landslides that appeared to block some roads.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard at the moment about any casualties, but I will be shocked if we don\u2019t hear that bad news coming through from Port Vila at some point,\u201d Katie Greenwood, \u200bthe Fiji-based head of the Asia-Pacific regional office for the Red Cross, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "McGarry said a \u201cmassive landslide\u201d at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway is also damaged, he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport could not be contacted on Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters that her country would provide whatever help was needed. New Zealand\u2019s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said 45 New Zealanders were registered as being in Vanuatu and his government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the situation there.",
      "Vanuatu has been led by four prime ministers in four years and is due to go to the polls in January for a snap election. In November, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai asked President Nikenike Vurobaravu to dissolve Parliament so he did not have to face a no-confidence vote as his recent predecessors did.",
      "But Vanuatu is accustomed to natural disasters, including havoc wrought by cyclones and volcanic eruptions. Its position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",

      "After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war",
      "After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war.",
      "Top officials from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to wrap up a deal. In a key concession, Hamas officials say they are prepared to show more \u201cflexibility\" on the timing of an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and Israel\u2019s defense minister, Israel Katz, said Monday that a deal is closer than ever.",
      "Officials on all sides have cautioned that key details must still be worked out. But there is a general sense of optimism that has been lacking for many months.",
      "The changing sentiment appears to be the result of several factors. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas over the course of the war. The group is more isolated after Hezbollah\u2019s ceasefire with Israel, and Iran, a key backer of both militant groups, has suffered a number of setbacks, highlighted by the downfall of its close ally, Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad.",
      "In the U.S., both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump have signaled they want a deal completed before the Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages \u2014 over one-third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Here is a closer look at the emerging deal, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed negotiations.",
      "The first phase would last from six to eight weeks. During that time, Hamas would release some 30 hostages \u2013 roughly half of those believed alive. They include three or four dual U.S.-Israeli citizens.",
      "Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including as many as 100 who are serving long sentences for alleged involvement in bloody attacks.",
      "The deal calls for a massive increase in aid to Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis during the 14-month war. An estimated 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, in many cases multiple times, and aid workers report severe hunger across the territory.",
      "This is expected to include a reopening of the territory\u2019s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since Israeli ground troops invaded the southern border town in May. The crossing is especially important because it is the primary exit point for Palestinians in Gaza who want to travel abroad, and the only one not controlled by Israel.",
      "Mediators say they are considering a return to a 2005 agreement that allowed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority to operate the crossing with European Union observers. That agreement collapsed when Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and expelled the Palestinian Authority forces.",
      "During the first phase, Israeli troops would withdraw from some Palestinian population centers, allowing many Palestinians to begin returning home. But Israeli troops wouldn't leave Gaza altogether at this stage. They would remain along the Philadelphi corridor \u2013 a strategic strip of land along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "During the initial ceasefire, the sides would continue negotiations on a permanent agreement, to include an end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas.",
      "Talks would begin on final arrangements for Gaza, including who would govern the territory and plans for rebuilding the destruction."

    "story": [
      "Palestinian security forces have launched a rare crackdown against local militant groups in the northern West Bank",
      "JENIN, West Bank -- Palestinian security forces have launched a rare crackdown against local militant groups in the northern West Bank, sending in armored cars and engaging in fierce gunbattles that have killed at least two people in the volatile area.",
      "The raid marks an unusual step for the Palestinian Authority, the governing body for semi-autonomous pockets in the occupied West Bank that is internationally recognized but has largely lost control of militant strongholds such as Jenin, where forces operated through the weekend and into Monday.",
      "Israeli troops have stepped into the vacuum in recent years, particularly since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militant attack that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say 811 Palestinians have been killed since then in the West Bank, most by Israeli raids into Palestinian cities and towns. Israel says most of the dead have been militants.",
      "On Saturday, Palestinian security forces said they had begun the operation in the Jenin refugee camp, a longtime militant stronghold. The operation was continuing Monday, with AP reporters hearing heavy gunfire and spotting at least two Palestinian armored vehicles roaming the outskirts of the camp.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said that security forces took over part of a hospital in Jenin, using it as a base and shooting from inside. Forces detained at least eight men, pulling one out of the hospital on a stretcher, the U.N. said.",
      "The main U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, suspended its services, including schooling.",
      "The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely across Jenin, and its streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs to the Palestinian struggle. Young men carrying walkie-talkies patrol the alleys.",
      "Israel says the militant groups are part of the Iranian \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d Both groups receive funding and other support from Iran, but they are deeply rooted in Palestinian society.",
      "The security forces are \u201coperating according to a clear political vision\u201d from Palestinian leadership \u201con the importance of imposing order, establishing the rule of law, restoring civil peace and societal security,\u201d spokesman Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab said. The troops were focused on \u201ceradicating\u201d Iran-backed groups that were trying to incite \u201cchaos and anarchy,\u201d he added.",
      "Palestinian security forces have reported the deaths of two men in the crackdown: a 19-year-old civilian, Rabhi Shalabi, shot riding a motorcycle, and an Islamic Jihad militant, Yazi Jaayseh.",
      "Security forces, which initially denied killing Shalabi before admitting it in a statement Friday, have not said why they targeted the young man. His 15-year-old cousin, who was also on the motorcycle, was shot in the head and wounded. U.N. officials, citing local video footage, have said the pair were unarmed and delivering food from a family restaurant when they were shot, and that Shalabi raised both in the air hands before he was killed.",
      "It was not immediately clear why the Palestinian Authority decided to launch the crackdown now. Such actions are unpopular with the Palestinian public, where many accuse the Palestinian security forces of collaborating with Israel.",
      "The Israeli military said it was not involved in the operation and did not comment further.",
      "Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi slammed the Palestinian Authority operating in Jenin as an \u201cattempt to end the resistance.\u201d In comments released by Hamas late Monday, he urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately stop its \u201cunpatriotic behavior that serves the occupation.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has sought to strengthen the Palestinian Authority, hoping it will help run the Gaza Strip after the war.",
      "White House officials declined to comment publicly on their position on the Jenin operation. Officials at the U.S. National Security Council also declined to comment.",
      "Overall, since the start of the war, the U.N. says that at least seven Palestinians have been killed by Palestinian security forces, and at least 24 Israelis have also been killed by Palestinian attackers in the West Bank."

      "LONDON -- An alleged Chinese spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew said Monday he has done \u201cnothing wrong or unlawful\u201d as Britain's government faced questions about what it is doing to thwart security threats from China.",
      "British authorities allege businessman Yang Tengbo \u2014 known only as \u201cH6\u201d until a High Court judge lifted an anonymity order Monday \u2014 was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.",
      "It's the most high-profile case in a series of espionage scandals in recent years that involved suspected or confirmed Chinese intelligence-gathering in Britain's establishment, including in Parliament.",
      "Here's a look at Yang's case:",
      "Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, is listed as a director of Hampton Group International, a business consultancy advising U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He has been photographed with senior U.K. politicians, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, at events.",
      "Yang is reportedly a key member of Pitch@Palace China, an initiative by Prince Andrew to support entrepreneurs.",
      "Yang worked as a junior civil servant in China before arriving in the U.K. in 2002 to study. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting his business.",
      "He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Yang told authorities he has spent regular time in Britain and considered it his second home.",
      "Details about Yang's case emerged last week at a special immigration tribunal, which upheld a decision by British authorities to ban Yang from entering the U.K. in 2023. The Home Office said he was believed to have carried out \u201ccovert and deceptive activity\u201d for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Judges agreed with MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence, that Yang \u201crepresented a risk to the national security\u201d and dismissed his appeal.",
      "The tribunal heard that in 2021, authorities found documents that showed how close Yang was to Prince Andrew, King Charles III's younger brother.",
      "One letter from a senior adviser to Andrew told Yang he should \u201cnever underestimate the strength\" of his relationship with the royal. \u201cOutside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,\u201d the adviser wrote.",
      "The tribunal said that when Yang was interviewed by immigration authorities he failed to give a full account of his relationship with the prince, which it said had a \u201ccovert and clandestine\u201d element.",
      "Authorities have not made public what information Yang allegedly obtained or was seeking to obtain. But the tribunal cited a 2022 statement by the MI5 director that described the United Front Work Department's aims as buying and exerting influence, amplifying pro-China voices and silencing those critical of the Chinese government's authority.",
      "Andrew has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners and prompted critics to suggest that those individuals were trying to buy access to the royal family.",
      "Yang strongly denied the espionage claims and said he was a victim of a changing political climate that had seen a rise in tensions between Britain and China.",
      "\u201cI have done nothing wrong or unlawful,\" he said in a statement. \"The widespread description of me as a \u2018spy\u2019 is entirely untrue.\u201d",
      "Andrew's office said the royal met Yang \u201cthrough official channels\u201d and nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is concerned about the challenge posed by China, but stood by his government's strategy of engagement and cooperation with Beijing.",
      "Starmer, who took office this summer, has sought to repair frayed ties and in November became the first British leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a leading critic of Beijing, said that glosses over the clear threat China poses. Yang was already a known member of China's United Front Work Department, he told Parliament, and should not have been able to gain access to the royal family without scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that there are many, many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that\u2019s taking place,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2022 British intelligence officials warned politicians that Christine Lee, a British-Chinese lawyer, had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China.",

      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across Ukraine's military",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The concert took place in an old movie studio in Kyiv, the location kept secret until the final moment in case it was the target of a Russian attack.",
      "More than 1,000 soldiers and young people gathered to listen to the artists who joined forces with a military brigade in an innovative effort to raise funds for Ukraine\u2019s embattled troops.",
      "This was the first and only live performance of the charity album \u201cEpoch,\u201d a collaboration between the 3rd Assault Brigade and eight Ukrainian bands.",
      "The project\u2019s ambitious target is to raise 50 million hryvnias (about $1.2 million) to buy an M113 armored personnel carrier to help get infantry to the front and evacuate the wounded for medical treatment. Since it launched on streaming platforms a month ago, the initiative has raised 9 million hryvnias (around $214,000).",
      "Grassroots fundraising for Ukrainian fighters dates back to 2014, the year Russia first annexed the southern region of Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in eastern Ukraine. At that time, Ukraine\u2019s defense was made up of a regular army supported by volunteer battalions who weren't financially supported by Kyiv\u2019s government. Self-funding was critical.",
      "Now, advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across the military. By scanning a QR code, people can help buy anything from body warmers and drones to armored cars for soldiers defending the nearly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",
      "But some charities are seeing a decline in individual donations in part because of the economic situation in the country.",
      "Oleksandr Borodyn, one of the project's organizers, says the idea for the collaboration came from the challenge of continuing to drum up funds to support troops as the war is on the cusp of marking a three-year milestone.",
      "\u201cTo raise the same amount of money as at the beginning of the war, you need much more effort. That\u2019s why we came up with the idea that a musician could donate his or her art, and that art would earn money for the army,\u201d said Borodyn, a press officer for the 3rd Assault Brigade.",
      "The initiative comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before Washington's support for Kyiv\u2019s defenses is thrown into question when Donald Trump takes office next month.",
      "Monobank, one of the largest platforms to process donations, says that in the first 1,000 days of war, nearly 10.5 million unique users made donations totaling around 77 billion hryvnias (about $1.8 billion) to various fundraising organizations.",
      "But some charity groups are finding that voluntary funding isn't what it was in the first year of the full-scale invasion. The Come Back Alive foundation supports troops with anything from military training to buying drones and electronic warfare to repel attacks. In the first year of the conflict, they raised more than 5.7 billion hryvnias ($184 million). So far in 2024, the figure is nearly 3.6 billion hryvnias ($89 million).",
      "\u201cMany people report a worsening financial situation, which limits their ability to contribute to supporting the military,\u201d said Oleh Karpenko, deputy director of the Come Back Alive Foundation.",
      "Three years of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine\u2019s economy. According to a World Bank report released in May, the number of Ukrainians living in poverty has grown by 1.8 million since 2020 to about 9 million, or 29% of the population.",
      "To help the most vulnerable, the government launched a winter support program at the beginning of December and within days, around 6.5 million people had applied to receive the one off 1,000 hryvnia ($24) payment to help cover utilities, medical services and cellphone costs.",
      "According to Karpenko, local initiatives and smaller-scale fundraising efforts mean many people direct their contributions toward helping specific soldiers or military units they know personally. That reduces the amount received by larger organizations, which he says can promptly address urgent battlefield needs that the government can't meet.",
      "\u201cInternational support also plays a significant role in donation levels,\" Karpenko said. \"When aid from international partners decreases, it strongly demotivates Ukrainian society. People lose motivation to donate when they perceive a lack of willingness from partners to actively supply weapons.\u201d",
      "Staring up at the large monitors set up on either side of the stage in the form of the three diagonal line symbol of the 3rd Assault Brigade, 26-year-old Oksana Kalenchenko thinks that events like the concert are hugely important in continuing to generate support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to somebody that there is a war going on in Ukraine, let\u2019s keep donating, let\u2019s keep doing everything we can,\u201d Kalenchenko said.",
      "The collaboration album features young artists from Ukraine\u2019s rock, rap and alternative scene, and many of the lyrics reflect events and the reality of living through the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe want to show the reflection of contemporary artists to the situation in Ukraine, and in general to Ukraine at war \u2026 That\u2019s why the project is called \u2018Epoch,\u2019 because it is a transmission of the era we are living in,\u201d Borodyn said.",
      "What also unites all the songs is language. Since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukrainian music has experienced somewhat of a revival with many artists shunning the traditional Russian pop scene that dominated the post-Soviet era.",
      "\u201cPeople did not pay attention to Ukrainian music in such a large number,\u201d says Iryna Panchuk, singer and songwriter for \u201cRenie Cares,\u201d one of the bands on the album. \u201cThis is separation, because this is what makes us different from Russia and this needs to be emphasized very strongly \u2014 emphasized and strengthened,\u201d she added.",

      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

    "summary": "Julie Scelfo started MAMA &mdash; Mothers Against Media Addiction &mdash; earlier this year to help parents fight back against the harms of social media on children",

      "Julie Scelfo started MAMA \u2014 Mothers Against Media Addiction \u2014 earlier this year to help parents fight back against the harms of social media on children",
      "Julie Scelfo started MAMA \u2014 Mothers Against Media Addiction \u2014 earlier this year to help parents fight back against the harms of social media on children. A former journalist, Scelfo says she was inspired to take action after reporting on the youth mental health crisis and how screens and social media are affecting young people\u2019s lives.",
      "The group has 28 chapters in 17 states, with waitlists to start other chapters. Scelfo says the group wants to establish chapters in every state, provide parent education about technology, \u201censure the school day remains smart-phone-free for students and overcome the \u201dinertia in our state capitals and Congress so technology is safeguarded like other consumer products.\"",
      "Scelfo spoke with The Associated Press recently about her work with MAMA, as well as a new Australian law banning children under 16 from using social media. The Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "QUESTION: What are the biggest issues you hear from parents about technology, anything new that hasn\u2019t been talked about as much?",
      "I\u2019m not sure it hasn\u2019t been talked about, but what I hear the most from parents is that they are extremely stressed about the ubiquity of technology in their children\u2019s lives and they don\u2019t know what to do about it. Whether it\u2019s the massive social pressure to get kids their own phones, or the fact that kindergartners are handed tablets on their first day of school, it can feel almost impossible for parents to do what they intrinsically know is better for their kids \u2014 which is to be outside in the world as much as possible and not parked in front of a screen. But parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children off screens and keeping them safe online because the problems are baked into society and into the design of the products.",
      "Parents and kids face a polycrisis \u2014 multiple crises happening at the same time which creates an effect even more devastating than each one would be individually. At a time when children should be building their social skills and attention span, they are increasingly interacting with the world through technology that can impede the development of both \u2013 and on platforms without adequate safeguards. Social media companies relentlessly target our kids with hidden algorithms that exploit their emotions for profit, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real understanding of just how pervasive that exploitation is.",
      "Q: Is Australia\u2019s ban on social media for kids under 16 the right move by a government? Why/why not?",
      "Australia\u2019s social media ban for children under 16 puts the responsibility of compliance where it should be \u2014 on tech platforms, not parents. With more than half of teenagers spending nearly five hours a day on social media platforms and our heart-breaking national youth mental health crisis, it\u2019s unconscionable that governments around the world, including here in the U.S., have failed to pass meaningful social media regulation since the days when AOL still distributed CD-ROMs by snail mail.",
      "Much like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) would do here in the U.S, Australia\u2019s ban represents a crucial first break in the long-standing logjam on any type of internet regulation and I applaud Australia\u2019s legislators and Prime Minister Albanese for having the courage to stand up to Big Tech.",
      "Big Tech is personalizing content to pull our kids into a world where addiction, anxiety, and even depression are side effects. To keep them on the app longer, children are shown more and more extreme content, leveraging the mountains of data they are collecting on our kids, with no common-sense safeguards or basic protections every parent expects. They are making billions while having the nerve to say it\u2019s the parents\u2019 job to make their products safe for our kids? It\u2019s time for governments to step in and force Beg Tech to take responsibility for the effects of their products. Big Tech has spent more than $51 million this year alone to prevent KOSA from passing.",
      "Q: What are the reasons that teens should wait until 16 to be on social media?",
      "A: Today\u2019s youth spend nearly 9 hours on screens daily and it\u2019s not healthy or safe for their hearts and minds. For example, Meta in September acknowledged taking action on 12 million pieces of suicide and self-harm content on Facebook and Instagram this year \u2014 just between April and June. Our kids\u2019 compulsion to check their phones is exposing them to unsafe content and displacing critical, real-world experiences they need to properly develop socially, emotionally and academically.",
      "Q: Won\u2019t kids just get around the restrictions, as they always do?",
      "A: Every other industry is safeguarded. From toys to food to buildings to cars, we have regulations in place to keep children safe. Why should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions \u2014 just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs \u2014 but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products, and so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.",
      "Q: What is your ultimate goal with MAMA?",
      "A: Just like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the genesis of this movement is fury and anger at the injustice of young people being robbed of their lives just because they happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
      "I want to direct that energy into cultural change \u2014 we can\u2019t continue to tout the benefits of technology without having an open and real-time discussion about its significant, and widespread harms and without ensuring that powerful corporations, just like Big Tobacco, are forced to make their products as safe as possible for humans.",
      "The ultimate goal for MAMA is to put tech products in their place: as powerful, and often helpful tools - but just a part of human life, not the center of it."

      "Starting in September of 2027, all new passenger vehicles in the U.S. will have to sound a warning if rear-seat passengers don\u2019t buckle up",
      "DETROIT -- Starting in September of 2027, all new passenger vehicles in the U.S. will have to sound a warning if rear-seat passengers don't buckle up.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday that it finalized the rule, which also requires enhanced warnings when front seat belts aren't fastened.",
      "The agency estimates that the new rule will save 50 lives per year and prevent 500 injuries when fully in effect, according to a statement.",
      "The new rule will apply to passenger cars, trucks, buses except for school buses, and multipurpose vehicles weighing up to 10,000 pounds.",
      "Before the rule, seat belt warnings were required only for the driver's seat. Under the new rule, outboard front-seat passengers also must get a warning if they don't fasten their belts. Front-center seats will not get a warning because NHTSA found that it wouldn't be cost effective. The agency said most vehicles already have warnings for the outboard passenger seats.",
      "The rule also lengthens the duration of audio and visual warnings for the driver's seat. The front-seat rules are effective starting Sept. 1 of 2026.",
      "Rear passengers consistently use seat belts at a lower rate than front passengers, the agency says. In 2022, front belt use was just under 92%, while rear use dropped to about 82%. About half of automobile passengers who died in crashes two years ago weren\u2019t wearing belts, according to NHTSA data.",
      "The seat belt rule is the second significant regulation to come from NHTSA in the past two months. In November the agency bolstered its five-star auto safety ratings to include driver assistance technologies and pedestrian protection.",
      "Safety advocates want the Department of Transportation, which includes NHTSA, to finish several more rules before the end of the Biden administration, because President-elect Donald Trump has said he\u2019s against new government regulations.",
      "Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, urged the department to approve automatic emergency braking for heavy trucks and technology to prevent impaired driving."

    "summary": "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

The measure, included in the massive National Defense Authorization Act, allows for the sale or donation of the items to states on the southern border, providing they are used to refurbish existing barriers, not install new ones. Congress also directed the Pentagon to account for storage costs for the border wall material while it has gone unused.",

      "The two ships, the Volgoneft 239 and the Volgoneft 212, were transporting roughly 9,200 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Social media footage from the scene showed a black liquid rising among the waves.",

      "An emergency rescue operation was launched Sunday after the Volgoneft-212 tanker ran aground and had its bow torn away in storm conditions, Russia\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry said. One sailor in the 13-man crew died, officials said.",

      "Russian officials confirmed the oil spill Sunday, but said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent.",

      "\u201cIt is likely to be driven by prevailing wind and currents and in the current weather conditions (it) is likely to be extremely difficult to contain. If it is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet on Monday.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years \u2014 whose popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration \u2014 can stay on as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThe Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cHer behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!\u201d",
      "Trump previously trolled Trudeau by calling Canada a state. And during his first term in his office \u2014 when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico \u2014 Trump said Freeland wasn't liked.",

      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated the trade with the United States.",
      "Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, had been set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless the neighbors stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "The statement shows a much larger deficit than expected for the fiscal year and more than a billion for border security.",
      "Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but many party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure was a huge blow.",

      "Authorities confirmed Monday that the 3.6 billion-pound ($4.6 billion) takeover of Royal Mail's owner, International Distribution Services, by billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group, can go ahead.",
      "Kretinsky and IDS agreed to the deal in May but had been waiting for official approval under national security laws because of the importance of the postal service in the U.K.",
      "The service will remain headquartered in the U.K. and as part of the deal, Britain's government will retain a so-called \u201cgolden share\u201d in the service, meaning it will need to approve any key changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the move was a \u201cgood deal for the U.K.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have negotiated something which secures the long-term future of Royal Mail and gives it the fresh start that we need,\" he said.",
      "Royal Mail, one of the U.K.'s oldest institutions, began in the 1500s as a service exclusively for the monarch and the royal court. It became a public postal service in the 1600s.",
      "The company, which was privatized in 2013, has struggled in recent years to adapt as the number of people using the postal service continues to decline steeply.",
      "Kretinsky has business interests across Europe including Eurstream, which moves Russian gas via pipelines through Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He already owns a 27% stake in IDS, and also has stakes in U.K. retail including in leading supermarket chain Sainsbury's.",
      "His firm previously said it viewed IDS as a strong business with the potential to become a leading postal logistics group in Europe.",
      "The takeover deal, which still needs to be voted on by shareholders, is expected to be completed early in 2025."

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s biggest bank apologized Monday for the alleged theft by an employee of more than 1 billion yen ($6.6 million) from customers\u2019 safe deposit boxes.",
      "The bank, formally known as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc., said Monday that it was investigating and that verified thefts from about 20 of the 60 clients thought to have been affected amounted to 300 million yen (nearly $2 million). Compensation was being worked out, it said.",

      "MUFG said the employee admitted taking the money and using it for investments and her personal purposes. She was fired and was cooperating with the bank's internal probe and a police investigation but has not yet been arrested.",
      "After news of the thefts surfaced, dozens more people came forward with claims of suspected losses that the bank is working to verify, it said.",
      "The MUFG case is the second recent one involving criminal activity at a major Japanese financial institution. In November, Nomura Holdings acknowledged that a former employee had been arrested on suspicion of robbery, attempted murder and arson targeting a client in Hiroshima.",
      "Asked about the MUFG thefts, the chief government spokesman said Monday that banking operations require high levels of trust and a sense of public service.",
      "The case was \u201cextremely regrettable,\u201d said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi."

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Justin Jefferson raced across the back of the end zone, leaped to catch the pass from Sam Darnold and launched into his latest touchdown celebration after an early score for the Minnesota Vikings.",
      "He finished the dance with a special tribute to one of his greatest inspirations, Randy Moss.",
      "\u201cWe love you Randy!\u201d Jefferson shouted toward the ESPN camera as he formed the shape of a heart with his fingers in front of his chest, showing the national television audience how the Vikings and their fans feel about the Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver who started his spectacular and sometimes-bumpy career with Minnesota in 1998.",
      "Moss revealed last week his diagnosis of cancer in his bile duct that was removed with a six-hour surgery and kept him hospitalized for six days. He has taken a leave from his job as an ESPN studio analyst but has vowed to return to the screen as soon as he can.",
      "The Vikings invited former wide receivers Cris Carter and Jake Reed \u2014 who with Moss made up the \u201cThree Deep\u201d trio that fueled a 15-1 regular season record in 1998 before a crushing overtime loss in the NFC championship game \u2014 to serve as honorary captains for the game on Monday night against Chicago. Carter and Reed held up a replica Moss jersey as they walked to midfield for the pregame coin flip.",
      "Moss chimed in on social media to return the love, accompanied by a clever hashtag: \"Let's Moss Cancer.\" The \u201cYou got Mossed!\u201d meme has been a recurring bit on ESPN's analysis programming to highlight a receiver burning a defender like Moss did for the Vikings, Raiders, Patriots and others over 14 seasons in the NFL while racking up four All-Pro selections and 156 receiving touchdowns to rank second all-time.",
      "\u201cGrateful for what he has done for this game and what he has done for me as a kid just watching him,\u201d Jefferson said after Minnesota's 30-12 victory over Chicago, wearing a Moss jersey during his postgame interview in the locker room. \u201cBeing a fan of him, always got to show love to him.\u201d",
      "Jefferson, who was a college teammate of Moss' son Thaddeus at LSU, said he sent a text message to Moss recently to wish him well after the cancer news came out.",
      "\u201cI always will have him in my prayers,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cThe effect he has on people, not just me but the whole world, is outstanding.\u201d",
      "Jefferson's only regret was he didn't get a second opportunity for a tribute. After breaking open around the 5-yard line for what would have been a 30-yard touchdown catch from Sam Darnold in the second quarter, Jefferson turned toward the goal line a split-second too soon and simply dropped the ball.",
      "\u201cI definitely will not sleep good at night thinking about that second touchdown that I could\u2019ve had. It\u2019ll have to wait until next week I guess,\u201d Jefferson said, adding: \u201cPlease, let's not talk about it. I was beating myself up a little bit afterward. Those are the easy ones. I always say the opportunities are limited and you\u2019ve got to make the most of your opportunities. I\u2019m definitely sick about that one. It was a great route, a great throw by Sam, and I just took my eyes off it.\u201d",
      "Moss would probably give him a pass, particularly considering the track Jefferson is on for this receiver-rich franchise. He's well on his way to joining Moss and Carter in Canton one day.",
      "\u201cI'm just happy he\u2019s back on his feet talking and being able to socialize,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cGod bless that.\u201d",

      "After two costly delays, the Pinellas County Commission is set to vote on its share of financing for a new $1.3 billion Tampa Bay Rays ballpark",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- After two costly delays, the Pinellas County Commission is set to vote Tuesday on its share of financing for a new $1.3 billion Tampa Bay Rays ballpark. Rays officials say they\u2019re confident of approval this time.",
      "The overall plan was approved by the county commission and city of St. Petersburg officials this summer, but votes on the funding for the deal had been postponed.",
      "Earlier this month, the St. Petersburg City Council voted to approve its share of the bonds necessary to build the new 30,000-seat ballpark. Now it's up to the county to decide whether to issue the bonds, which would be paid for by tourist taxes that can\u2019t be spent on things such as hurricane recovery.",
      "Under the agreement, the city and county would put up about half the cost, with the Rays covering the rest, including any cost overruns.",
      "\u201cWe're upholding our part of the bargain,\u201d City Council Chair Deborah Figgs-Sanders said at a meeting earlier this month. \u201cWe said we were going to do this. We're doing it. Now what you got?\u201d",
      "The proposal caps years of uncertainty about the Rays\u2019 future, including possible moves across the bay to Tampa, or to Nashville, Tennessee, or even to split home games between St. Petersburg and Montreal, an idea Major League Baseball rejected.",
      "Under the stadium deal, the Rays commit to remain in St. Petersburg for another 30 years. But the Rays will play this season in Tampa at the New York Yankees\u2019 spring training site, Steinbrenner Field, because of hurricane damage to Tropicana Field.",
      "The proposed stadium is a signature piece of a broader $6.5 billion revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which refers to a predominantly Black neighborhood that was forced out by construction of the Trop and an interstate highway spur.",
      "Supporters say the development would transform an 86-acre (34-hectare) tract in the city\u2019s downtown, with plans for a Black history museum, affordable housing, entertainment venues, plus office and retail space \u2014 and the promise of thousands of jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is much, much bigger than a stadium,\u201d Pinellas County Commission Chair Kathleen Peters said at a November meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s about the investment we can make and the return on that investment that can guarantee we can keep our taxes low.\u201d",

      "Zach Hyman scored twice, Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist, and Kasperi Kapanen and Connor Brown also scored for the Oilers, who snapped a five-game winning streak. Connor McDavid had three assists and Stuart Skinner finished with 22 saves.",

      "Panthers: Florida got a huge short-handed goal just 2:42 into the first period as Boqvist stole a puck from a stumbling Evan Bouchard and went in on the breakaway before sending his fifth of the season through Skinner\u2019s legs. It was Florida\u2019s second goal in 214 minutes, including shutouts in the two previous games. Florida leads the NHL with eight short-handed goals.",
      "Oilers: Draisaitl had his sixth straight multi-point game, with 15 points in that stretch. He has 17 multi-point games this season and leads the league in goals (23), even-strength goals (18), and game-winning goals (seven).",
      "Verhaeghe got a centering pass from Bennett from the left corner, got Skinner to go down and fired a shot over the goalie's shoulder into the top left corner to give the Panthers a 6-5 lead with 6:55 to go.",

    "story": [
      "Kirk Cousins threw his first touchdown pass in five weeks and the Atlanta Falcons did just enough to beat the struggling Las Vegas Raiders 15-9 and keep pace in the NFC South race",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Ahead most of the game, including by double digits in the fourth quarter, the Atlanta Falcons were just trying to hold on at the end.",
      "The Raiders had two passes into the end zone. Two passes to steal a victory and hand Atlanta a considerable setback to its playoff hopes.",
      "Desmond Ridder's first attempt was incomplete and his second was intercepted by Jessie Bates III, allowing Atlanta to escape Las Vegas with a 15-9 victory Monday night and keep pace in the NFC South.",
      "The Falcons (7-7) ended a four-game losing streak to remain a game behind the first-place Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Atlanta owns the head-to-head tiebreaker in a close race with three games remaining.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where you want to be, and that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re at,\u201d Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a short week. We\u2019ve got to get back in the lab. We\u2019ve got to find ways to fix what we did wrong tonight and come out and get another win.\u201d",
      "Atlanta has a favorable remaining schedule, facing two teams with a combined five wins that sandwich a trip to 9-5 Washington. Tampa Bay has a similar finishing stretch.",
      "A potential No. 1 overall draft pick rather than playoff scenarios make up most of the conversation regarding Las Vegas (2-12). The Raiders lost their 10th consecutive game, the NFL's longest active skid, and are tied with the New York Giants for the league's worst record. It is the fifth-longest skid in Raiders history, and worst since dropping 16 straight a decade ago.",
      "Kirk Cousins entered with no touchdown passes and eight interceptions over his previous four starts, raising questions about whether rookie Michael Penix Jr. would take over at quarterback for Atlanta. Morris stuck by Cousins \u2014 who signed a four-year, $180 million contract this year \u2014 over the eighth pick in the NFL draft.",
      "Cousins did little to assuage concerns about his play, passing for just 112 yards with an interception. His 30-yard pass to a wide-open Drake London with 14 seconds left in the first quarter to put Atlanta ahead 7-0 was his first touchdown toss since firing three of them Nov. 3 in a 27-21 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "\u201cHe's got to play better,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Cousins didn't disagree.",
      "\u201cIt's stating the obvious,\" he said.",
      "The Falcons got the rest of their points on two field goals from Younghoe Koo and a safety by defensive lineman Zach Harrison.",
      "Bijan Robinson rushed for 125 yards and London caught three passes for 53 yards to give him 219 career receptions. London passed Calvin Ridley's 217 catches for most in Falcons history over a player's first three seasons.",
      "Atlanta prevented Ridder from putting a dent in its playoff plans. Ridder, who started 13 games for the Falcons last season before he was traded to Arizona, was stymied most of the night in his first start this season. In replacing Aidan O'Connell, inactive because of a bruised left knee, Ridder passed for 208 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.",
      "Ridder again downplayed the emotions of playing against his former team, emphasizing this was more about the Raiders than him.",
      "\u201cWe were never able to find a rhythm until late in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cBy then, it's too little, too late.\u201d",
      "The injury-riddled Raiders gained just 249 yards, and they have trailed by double digits in all 14 games this season.",
      "O'Connell wasn't the only player missing. Defensive end Maxx Crosby announced Saturday he would be undergoing season-ending ankle surgery, and the Raiders were without about half their starting lineup on defense.",
      "Las Vegas also lost running back Sincere McCormick, who had recently become the starter, to an ankle injury early in the second quarter.",
      "Even so, the Raiders nearly rallied to win.",
      "Ridder's 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah with 2:54 left brought Las Vegas within six. The extra point was blocked, the third time the Falcons got their hands on a Raiders punt or kick.",
      "After getting the ball back for a last-gasp drive, the Raiders converted a fourth-and-8 from their 34-yard line to eventually set up Ridder's two shots into the end zone.",
      "\u201cDesmond did a good job throwing it up there,\u201d Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said. \u201cIt\u2019s a jump-ball situation.\u201d",
      "Falcons: Host the New York Giants on Sunday.",

      "Aaron Jones and Cam Akers had touchdown runs in the second half to complement a smothering performance by the Minnesota defense, and the Vikings moved into a tie for first place in the NFC North by beating the Chicago Bears 30-12 for their seventh cons...",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Their spot in the playoffs secure, the Minnesota Vikings delivered a prime-time performance seeped in those ingredients that frequently fuel postseason success.",
      "Aaron Jones and Cam Akers had touchdown runs in the second half to complement an unrelenting defense, and the Vikings forged a tie for first place in the NFC North on Monday night by beating the Chicago Bears 30-12 for their seventh consecutive victory.",
      "The Vikings (12-2), who clinched a spot in the playoffs with Seattle\u2019s loss to Green Bay, caught their big break when Detroit\u2019s 11-game winning streak was stopped by Buffalo earlier on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIts going to be incredibly competitive down the stretch,\u201d Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to play well and continue to improve, chasing our best football.\u201d",
      "Justin Jefferson had seven catches for 73 yards, among them a touchdown from Sam Darnold in the first quarter that was set up by Jonathan Greenard's sack and forced fumble on Caleb Williams.",
      "\u201cJust seeing us stacking the plays, stacking the good games together is really good to see,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cOur potential is so high. Every game we\u2019re expecting the offense to be the best on that field.\u201d",
      "The Bears put plenty of heat on Darnold, who went 24 for 40 for 231 yards and threw his first interception in five games on a fourth-and-3 throw three plays after Jefferson dropped what would've been a 30-yard touchdown pass.",
      "With a double-digit-point lead for the last 50-plus minutes of the game, the Vikings turned to Jones for 18 rushes and 86 yards.",
      "\u201cSeeing the amount of effort he\u2019s doing after the first contact is what\u2019s crazy to me, fighting for those extra yards and getting those first downs,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cHaving a back like that is tremendous.\u201d",
      "Wearing white helmets for the first time in franchise history to top the snow-like jerseys and pants in their now-annual winter-themed home game \u2014 comfortably staged indoors \u2014 the Vikings had an energized crowd behind them after former wide receivers Cris Carter and Jake Reed took a Randy Moss jersey to midfield for the coin flip in honor of their ex-teammate, who is being treated for cancer. Jefferson shouted, \u201cWe love you, Randy!\u201d after his touchdown catch.",
      "The defense picked up the vibe, allowing the Bears to convert just one of 12 third downs and one of three fourth downs. Williams was exhausted from having to sprint around so much to avoid being sacked, doubling over on the bench at one point in the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cOur defense was phenomenal,\u201d O'Connell said.",
      "Williams managed to keep alive his NFL rookie record streak of 286 straight passes without an interception for the eighth straight game, but the Bears (4-10) have lost all of those.",
      "The first overall pick in the 2024 draft went 18 for 31 for 191 yards and threw a late touchdown pass to Keenan Allen after a blocked punt gave Chicago the ball at the Minnesota 27.",
      "D\u2019Andre Swift rushed 19 times for 79 yards for the Bears, who\u2019ve been outscored 53-0 in the first half over the last three games. According to Sportradar, they\u2019re the first team with three consecutive scoreless first halves since Jacksonville in 2018.",
      "\u201cJust trying to find ways to put us in better spots, design better plays, call better plays,\u201d interim coach Thomas Brown said.",
      "Once again, the Bears produced a handful of can't-happen plays that ultimately doomed them. Swift was stuffed for no gain on a toss sweep on fourth-and-1 from the Chicago 39 on the opening possession and again on a fourth-and-1 run at the Minnesota 29 in the second quarter.",
      "In the third quarter, Swift had a short touchdown run erased by penalty when backup center Doug Kramer neglected to report as an eligible receiver upon entering as an extra blocker for the goal line play. After that, rookie Kiran Amegadjie, who took three penalties in his first NFL start and was beaten badly by Greenard on the strip-sack, was called for holding. The Bears settled for a short field goal.",
      "\u201cScoring in this league is tough. Winning games is tough. You've got to score to be able to win,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTaking those points off the board, it obviously hurt us.\u201d",
      "Bears: Amegadjie subbed for Braxton Jones, who was out with a concussion along with backup RB Roschon Johnson and backup LG Ryan Bates.",
      "Vikings: RT Brian O'Neill hurt his right knee in the first quarter but after being sidelined for a handful of series returned for most of the second half. ... CB Stephon Gilmore missed his second straight game with a hamstring injury.",
      "The Bears host the Lions on Sunday, when the Vikings visit the Seahawks.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Tyrese Maxey scored 40 points, Paul George added 33 points as the Philadelphia 76ers spoiled LaMelo Ball\u2019s return to the floor with a 121-108 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night.",
      "Maxey and George were combined for 12 for 21 on 3-pointers.",
      "Kelly Oubre Jr. had 19 points, while Andre Drummond, starting in place of the injured Joel Embiid, chipped in with 15 rebounds for the 76ers (8-16).",
      "Miles Bridges had 24 points and Nick Richards added 19 points off the bench to lead the Hornets.",
      "Ball returned to action after missing the last seven games with a strained calf, finishing with 15 points and 11 assists in nearly 26 minutes.",
      "Ball's return meant the Hornets (7-19) finally had their preseason projected starting five on the floor together for the first time this season. But that lasted a little more than three quarters as Brandon Miller sprained his left ankle with 8:20 remaining in the game on a drive to the basket and did not return.",
      "76ers: With Joel Embiid out with a sinus fracture, George and Maxey had to carry the load. And they certainly did that, particularly in the first half when they combined for 44 of Philadelphia\u2019s 54 points while shooting 9 of 16 from beyond the arc.",
      "Hornets: The Hornets starting five struggled all night to get in sync and 76ers did an outstanding job of not letting Miller get free for open looks.",
      "Shortly after the Hornets had cut the 76ers lead to five, George hit a short fadeaway jumper in the lane and drew a foul for a 3-point play, helping push the lead back to 13.",
      "The Hornets shot 11 of 19 from the foul line.",
      "The 76ers host the Hornets on Friday night. The Hornets visit the Wizards on Thursday night.",

      "The Baltimore Orioles have agreed to a $13 million, one-year contract with Japanese star Tomoyuki Sugano",
      "BALTIMORE -- Tomoyuki Sugano is headed to the major leagues at last.",
      "The Baltimore Orioles agreed to a $13 million, one-year contract with the star Japanese right-hander Monday night. Sugano is coming off an MVP season \u2014 his third \u2014 in Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League. The 35-year-old spent 12 years with the Yomiuri Giants. He was posted by the Giants following the 2020 season and was available for major league teams to bid on, but he did not agree to a deal.",
      "Sugano went 15-3 with a 1.67 ERA last season, walking only 16 batters in 156 2/3 innings. He added another MVP award after winning in 2014 and 2020.",
      "Sugano pitched for Japan at the 2017 World Baseball Classic and allowed three hits in six innings in the semifinal against the United States.",
      "The Orioles have some pitching questions after making the postseason each of the past two seasons. Baltimore ace Corbin Burnes is a free agent, and starters Kyle Bradish and Tyler Wells were both sidelined last year following Tommy John surgery. Grayson Rodriguez missed time down the stretch because of a lat injury.",
      "If Burnes doesn't come back, Rodriguez, Zach Eflin and Dean Kremer figure to be in the rotation, but it remains to be seen how much adding the Orioles do the rest of this offseason. Sugano represents another option with some potential upside on a low-risk deal \u2014 although he can't be assigned to the minor leagues without his consent.",
      "In addition to the $13 million salary, Sugano can earn several award bonuses: $50,000 for All-Star selection or election; $100,000 for a Cy Young Award, $75,000 for second place and $50,000 for third; $50,000 for a Gold Glove; $100,000 for World Series MVP and $50,000 for League Championship Series MVP. He'll become a free agent when the contract expires.",

      "For the league's superstars, that amount might represent a game's pay \u2014 or maybe even a half-game's pay. For much of the league, it's still a colossal sum.",
      "\u201cI try not to think about the money,\u201d said Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is making about $48.8 million this season. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not accurate what I\u2019m saying. I think about the money \u2014 but I think about the money when we talk about the young guys.\u201d",
      "Winning players Tuesday will receive $514,971 from the league's Cup prize pool if they're on standard NBA contracts. The players on the losing team Tuesday will get $205,988 apiece; players on two-way deals will get half of those figures.",
      "At his current salary of $578,577, Thunder two-way player Ajay Mitchell would be making about $7,056 per game. He's going to do a lot better than that on Tuesday, win or lose.",

      "The NBA Cup has a prize pool to incentivize players.

      "\u201cNot everybody gets the same paycheck in the NBA,\u201d said Thunder forward Jalen Williams, who is making about $4.8 million this season. \u201cWe have guys that are on two-way contracts and some guys that are fighting to stay in the league. So, obviously, that money is a bigger deal for some people than others \u2014 so we definitely play for that.\u201d",
      "Bucks reserve A.J. Green makes about $2.1 million this season. The idea of adding $500,000 to that for winning one game blew his mind.",
      "\u201cIt is crazy,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t make you play any harder. It really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Nothing makes Bucks forward Bobby Portis play harder; he's one of the guys in the league who seems to treat every game with the same all-out vigor. He's from Little Rock, Arkansas, where the median household income is about $60,000 and it\u2019s estimated that 1 in 6 people in that city of about 200,000 are living in poverty.",
      "It's not lost on Portis \u2014 who's making about $12.6 million this season \u2014 how lucky he is.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll take guys a lifetime to make $500,000 where I\u2019m from,\u201d Portis said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t take any dollar amount lightly.\u201d",
      "Green said he would give some of that bonus to his church, some of it to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and save the rest. Mitchell plans on saving just about all of whatever comes his way from his NBA Cup experience.",
      "Antetokounmpo\u2019s NBA contracts \u2014 past and future \u2014 add up to about $460 million, and that\u2019s just the total of his on-court deals. He fulfilled his life dream of being able to provide for his family long ago; he\u2019s built wealth that will last for generations. That said, he still says Tuesday should be significant to everyone.",

It\u2019s an ongoing joke we have in our locker room. We say we play for the young guys because this money will mean a lot to them. But it really means a lot to everybody \u2014 because it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich intends to return to coaching, he said Monday in his first public comments since suffering a stroke in early November.",
      "Popovich, the NBA's career coaching wins leader, released a statement through the Spurs expressing gratitude for the support he has received in recent weeks. He had what the Spurs said was a mild stroke about 2 1/2 hours prior to the team's home game against Minnesota on Nov. 2.",
      "There is no timetable for his return to coaching, though the Spurs have said doctors expect Popovich to make a full recovery.",
      "\u201cThis has certainly been an unexpected six weeks for my family and me,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAs we work together on my recovery, I want to take a moment to share that the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received during this time has been truly overwhelming in the best possible way.",
      "\u201cWhile I wish I could get back to each one of you, for now, let me say that my family and I are forever grateful. We\u2019re thankful for our wonderful community, the entire Spurs organization, and our family and friends.\u201d",
      "The 75-year-old Popovich has led the Spurs to five championships and guided the United States to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He is in his 29th season as coach of the Spurs.",
      "The stroke happened at the team's arena, and since rescue workers were there, Popovich was able to start receiving treatment almost immediately. He was transported to a nearby hospital.",
      "It has not been revealed what lingering effects of the stroke Popovich is dealing with, and how much longer his rehabilitation process may take. Longtime Spurs assistant Mitch Johnson has served as acting coach in Popovich's absence.",
      "\u201cMitch has done an incredible job,\u201d Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said earlier this month.",
      "In his typical self-deprecating style, Popovich said those assisting in his rehabilitation are eager for him to return to work.",
      "Evidently, he's not the best patient \u2014 or a patient person.",
      "\u201cNo one is more excited to see me return to the bench than the talented individuals who have been leading my rehabilitation process,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey\u2019ve quickly learned that I\u2019m less than coachable.\u201d",
      "Popovich is one of only three coaches to win the NBA coach of the year award three times, Don Nelson and Pat Riley being the others. He\u2019s one of five coaches with at least five NBA titles; Phil Jackson (11), Red Auerbach (nine), John Kundla (five) and Riley (five) are the others.",
      "Popovich has been part of the Spurs for nearly 35 years. He was an assistant coach from 1988-92, then returned to the club on May 31, 1994, as its executive vice president for basketball operations and general manager. He fired coach Bob Hill and appointed himself coach on Dec. 10, 1996.",
      "He\u2019s been the Spurs\u2019 sideline boss ever since.",

    "story": [
      "Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson has resigned",
      "Wake Forest's Dave Clawson won big at the private university with one of the smallest enrollments in the Bowl Subdivision ranks. Now it's up to someone else to try to do the same.",
      "Clawson resigned Monday, ending an 11-year run with an unexpected announcement that he had given \u201deverything I had\" for the program and school.",
      "His tenure included guiding Wake Forest to 11 wins and a trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in 2021, as well as cracking the top 10 of the AP poll in 2021 and 2022 amid a run of six straight bowl appearances. But the Demon Deacons had gone just 4-8 in the past two seasons as the formula that had helped them sustain success became trickier to manage in today's era of free player movement through the transfer portal and players being able to cash in on their athletic fame through name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities.",
      "In a statement released by the school, the 57-year-old coach said \u201cthe timing is right\u201d after working 36 straight seasons in college football to step into a new advisory role to athletic director John Currie with an undergraduate enrollment of 5,471 students as of the 2023-24 academic year.",
      "\u201cCoaching at Wake Forest has been the honor of my career,\u201d Clawson said. \u201dThis is a special place with extraordinary people, and I am deeply grateful for the relationships I\u2019ve built over the last 11 years. Together, we achieved things that many thought impossible, and I step down knowing I gave everything I had for this program and university.\"",
      "In an open letter on the school's athletics site that has been a regular fixture, Currie said Clawson's decision was \u201cnot the news we had wanted to share.\u201d Currie said Clawson had confided that he was contemplating his future in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cAnd I held out hope, until our meeting earlier today, that he would change his mind,\u201d Currie wrote, noting that Clawson and Currie met with the team via Zoom to inform them shortly before the school's announcement.",
      "Clawson took over in 2014 after Jim Grobe's successful run that included winning the 2006 ACC title. And much like Grobe, Clawson found success at the elite but small private university with a formula that leaned on player retention and long-term development to compete against programs drawing four- and five-star recruits.",
      "Clawson's Demon Deacons typically redshirt young players and bring them along slowly, allowing them to get stronger and picking up larger roles to hone their skills. By the time most of those players would crack the two-deep depth chart, the goal then would be to play disciplined football with clean execution while avoiding self-defeating mistakes.",
      "When working its best, Wake Forest often had a prolific, tempo-controlling offense \u2014 featuring an ability to churn out developed receivers \u2014 while ranking among the nation's leaders for fewest penalty yards and turnovers. And there was long runs of coaching continuity on Clawson's staff with few changes, a combination that Currie said in a statement \u201cmade football at Wake Forest important.\u201d",
      "During that seven-year bowl run (2016-22), Wake Forest ranked tied for eighth in the FBS in turnover margin (+39), No. 8 in fewest penalty yards per game (42.2) and No. 9 in fewest penalties per game (4.93).",
      "It all came together in 2021, a season that included Clawson reaching a long-term contract extension with the school on the eve of the ACC division-clinching win at Boston College.",
      "That 11-win team lost to Pittsburgh in the ACC championship game in a season. But it was a magical season, with the Demon Deacons starting 8-0 and hitting No. 10 in the poll, led by star quarterback Sam Hartman in an offense ranked fourth nationally in scoring (41.0) while also ranking sixth in third-down conversion rate (49.6%).",
      "And yet, Hartman soon became an example of the challenges of today\u2019s climate for Clawson and the rest of FBS ranks. Two years later, Hartman was gone \u2014 not because he had run out of eligibility, but because he was transferring for a one-year run at Notre Dame in a high-profile player move.",
      "Clawson spoke multiple times, too, about the challenges of retaining players in this era. Notably, he said roughly a half-dozen of his players returned for the 2023 season despite tampering efforts by other schools promising lucrative endorsement deals to transfer ranging from roughly $150,000 to $500,000.",
      "This year's team ranked near the bottom of the national stats in defense (117th in total at 435.0 yards, 113th in scoring (32.5), and languished through multiple losses that seemed to wear on Clawson in his postgame news conferences.",
      "That included the Demon Deacons blowing a 13-point fourth-quarter lead at home to lose to Virginia in their second game, then losing at home to Louisiana three weeks later when their final-play tying field goal from 42 yards out plunked the left upright. Still, Clawson guided Wake Forest wins in its first three road games to recover from a 1-3 start and enter November needing to split the final four games to become bowl eligible again.",
      "Instead, the Demon Deacons lost them all. The last came at home to Duke, with the Blue Devils rallying from 14 down and winning on a 39-yard touchdown pass as time expired.",
      "That crushing loss, with Wake Forest punting on its final three possessions to go 1-6 at home, turned out to be Clawson's Wake Forest finale.",

      "Still, Swinney had enough time to follow how Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick joined the Atlantic Coast Conference as North Carolina's new leader.",
      "\u201cIt's incredible,\u201d Swinney said Monday, his face breaking into a huge grin.",
      "Swinney, like Belichick, knows about winning championships with nine ACC titles and two national titles in 16 full seasons with the Tigers.",
      "He's got nothing but admiration for Belichick, who has 302 wins in the NFL and six Super Bowl victories as a head coach, all the championships with the New England Patriots.",
      "Most figured that the 72-year-old Belichick, whose tenure with New England ended after last season, would wait for his next NFL chance to return to coaching. Yet he accepted the job with the Tar Heels last week and has already begun putting together a program Belichick expects to rival Clemson in terms of time at the top of the ACC.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's pretty cool,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cIt's going to be something seeing him walk into ACC meetings or things like that.\u201d",
      "Swinney has had his hands full this week prepping for the fifth-seeded Longhorns (11-2) on Friday. The 13th-ranked Tigers (10-3) earned the 12th and final CFP seed with a 34-31 win over SMU on Dec. 7 on a dramatic, 56-yard field goal by freshman Nolan Hauser as time expired.",
      "The Tigers will head to Texas on Thursday.",
      "Swinney took some time, though, to recall his only meeting with Belichick, which came at one of Clemson's pro days during the Tigers' run of six straight CFP appearances from 2015-20. Both were complimentary of the other during their visit.",
      "Swinney was present at a pair of Patriot Super Bowls, both coming as Belichick had Clemson tight end Dwayne Allen on his roster. The first came in Atlanta in February 2017 when New England rallied from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Falcons in overtime, 34-28.",
      "The next year, Swinney was in attendance in Minneapolis as Allen and the Patriots fell to Philadelphia 41-33.",
      "Wes Goodwin, Clemson\u2019s defensive coordinator, has studied Belichick\u2019s defensive schemes for years and believes Belichick will elevate the Tar Heels\u2019 defense and that improvement will spread through the ACC.",

      "Swinney has had success against the best of the best in the past. Both Clemson national titles in 2016 and 2018 came over Alabama and national championship icon Nick Saban. Swinney won all three matchups in six seasons against Belichick's Tar Heels predecessor in Mack Brown, who won a national crown at Texas.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn\u2019t hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s not becoming a safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to be prepared.\u201d",
      "Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there\u2019s a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.",
      "With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California\u2019s Inland Empire.",
      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",
      "Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guidance on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world\u2019s largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.",
      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

      "\u201cFollowing serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,\u201d European Commission president Ursula on der Leyen said in a press release. \u201cIt should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.\u201d",

      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Drones are being spotted all over the U.S. But are those flashing lights in the sky really airplanes",
      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have a flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a more high-pitched buzzing noise than what's generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multi-copter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

    "summary": "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

    "story": [
      "Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey within the past week have shown little to no evidence of anything nefarious or threatening",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey in the past week have found \u201clittle to no evidence\u201d of anything nefarious or threatening, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as calls grew for action to address the mysterious nighttime sightings of suspected unmanned flights across the northeastern U.S.",
      "Murphy told reporters in Trenton that there were 12 sightings of suspected drones in the state on Saturday and one on Sunday. He declined to go into detail about the detection equipment, but said it was powerful enough to disable the drones, although he added that is not legal on U.S. soil.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, echoed calls by state officials elsewhere for Congress to allow them to deal with drones. Nearly all the power now rests with the federal government.",
      "\"It is extraordinary to me that, that a nation as great as ours and as powerful as ours has the deficiencies that we have now seen in living color as it relates to drone incursions,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have repeatedly said there are no signs that any drone operators have shown bad intent, nor is there evidence of foreign involvement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "But that hasn't reassured everyone. Conspiracy theories about foreign actors, the U.S. government and the \u201cdeep state,\u201d abound online, while elected officials concerned about threats to military bases, airports and other locations have increased their calls for federal officials to act.",
      "The skeptics include President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested Monday that \"the government knows what is happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur military knows and our president knows and for some reason they want to keep people in suspense,\u201d Trump said. He refused to say whether he had been briefed on the drone sightings.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat, told The Associated Press that officials could do a better job helping the public to understand what is going on, especially when people wrongly conclude they are seeing unmanned aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhat the public could use is like walking through that rather than just, you know, as a statement that says nothing, nothing to be concerned about,\u201d he said. \"I think it\u2019s reached a level of just public attention that some greater level of depth is necessary.\u201d",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no supporting evidence for the president-elect's statement Monday that information is being withheld and that a lack of faith in institutions is playing a key part in the saga.",
      "\u201cNothing that I\u2019m seeing, nothing that I\u2019ve engaged in gives me any impression of that nature. But like, I get it, some people won\u2019t believe me, right? Because that\u2019s the level of distrust that we face.\u201d",
      "Over the past two days, New York and Pennsylvania officials have also requested drone-detecting equipment from federal officials.",
      "\"It is imperative our communities in Pennsylvania are protected and questions on the presence of these drones are answered,\u201d U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, wrote in a letter to Mayorkas on Monday. \"State-of-the-art radar systems will provide insights into where these drones are deploying from and what the motives for their flights may be.\u201d",
      "After reports of drones in Connecticut, state police said they were monitoring drone activity and state officials said analysts were comparing reported sightings with federal flight data.",
      "\u201cOne of the drone sightings had the word Frontier on the back, that was an airline,\u201d Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said Monday. \u201cBut some of them are big and unexplained and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this. Right now, what we do is we make sure that our security and airports are secure.\u201d",
      "At a media briefing on Monday, the Pentagon's press secretary, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said defense officials have seen no indication that the drones flying over multiple locations in the U.S. are being controlled by a foreign country. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, he said, there are approximately 1 million registered drones in the U.S. and about 8,000 are flying any given day.",
      "Ryder said that while military bases overseas can use surveillance methods that quickly address the origin of drones, that power is limited in U.S. airspace because of domestic surveillance laws. He said most drones are operated through either radio frequency transmissions or satellite-guided GPS navigation, which can provide information about the operators. If they're not controlled by those methods, that's another clue, he said.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m kind of talking around it because I don\u2019t necessarily want to get into talking classified capabilities, but the bottom line is that all of that gives us an idea that, hey, these are not foreign origin,\" Ryder said.",
      "Christopher Stadulis, a retired New York City firefighter and drone hobbyist, said he's seen clusters of drones near his home in Clinton Township, New Jersey. He said the lights he has seen at night are different from those used by commercial airlines, and the drones he has seen are very large.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what I\u2019m seeing with the naked eye, you can see it\u2019s not a normal aircraft,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \"This and we don\u2019t have this much traffic, you know, usually on any given night in this area. So it seems like definitely some of them are aircraft that we can\u2019t explain what they are.\u201d",
      "More suspected drone sightings over the weekend led to a temporary airspace shutdown at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, for about four hours late Friday into Saturday, and the arrests of two men in Boston accused of flying a drone \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Logan International Airport.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that he is introducing legislation calling on federal officials to provide public briefings on what they know about the drones and calling for a drone air traffic control system similar to those used for planes. He also wants law enforcement to be given access to drone detectors and the authority to \u201ctake out drones that shouldn't be in the air.\"",
      "\u201cI believe the people I represent and, as I\u2019ve been saying for some time now, the people in New Jersey and around the country deserve answers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve transparency from their government.\u201d",

      "Instead of being a youthful 400 million years old as commonly thought, the icy, shimmering rings could be around 4.5 billion years old just like Saturn, a Japanese-led team reported Monday.",
      "The scientists surmise Saturn\u2019s rings may be pristine not because they are young but because they are dirt-resistant.",
      "Saturn's rings are long thought to be between 100 million and 400 million years old based on more than a decade of observations by NASA's Cassini spacecraft before its demise in 2017.",
      "Images by Cassini showed no evidence of any darkening of the rings by impacting micrometeoroids \u2014 space rock particles smaller than a grain of sand \u2014 prompting scientists to conclude the rings formed long after the planet.",
      "Through computer modeling, the Institute of Science Tokyo's Ryuki Hyodo and his team demonstrated that micrometeoroids vaporize once slamming into the rings, with little if any dark and dirty residue left behind. They found that the resulting charged particles get sucked toward Saturn or out into space, keeping the rings spotless and challenging the baby rings theory. Their results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.",
      "Hyodo said it's possible Saturn's rings could be somewhere between the two extreme ages \u2014 around the halfway mark of 2.25 billion years old. But the solar system was much more chaotic during its formative years with large planetary-type objects migrating and interacting all over the place, just the sort of scenario that would be conducive to producing Saturn's rings.",

      "On the way across Chicago, El-Amin\u2019s daughter spotted a classmate riding with her own dad as they drove to their selective public school on the city\u2019s North Side. For 40 minutes, they rode along the same congested highway.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re waving to each other in the back. I\u2019m looking at the dad. The dad\u2019s looking at me. And I was like, parents can definitely be a resource to parents,\u201d said El-Amin, who went on to found Piggyback Network, a service parents can use to book rides for their children.",
      "Reliance on school buses has been waning for years as districts struggle to find drivers and more students attend schools far outside their neighborhoods. As responsibility for transportation shifts to families, the question of how to replace the traditional yellow bus has become an urgent problem for some, and a spark for innovation.",
      "State and local governments decide how widely to offer school bus service. Lately, more have been cutting back. Only about 28% of U.S. students take a school bus, according to a Federal Highway Administration survey concluded early last year. That\u2019s down from about 36% in 2017.",
      "Chicago Public Schools, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest district, has significantly curbed bus service in recent years. It still offers rides for disabled and homeless students, in line with a federal mandate, but most families are on their own. Only 17,000 of the district\u2019s 325,000 students are eligible for school bus rides.",
      "Last week, the school system launched a pilot program allowing some students who attend out-of-neighborhood magnet or selective-enrollment schools to catch a bus at a nearby school\u2019s \u201chub stop.\u201d It aims to start with rides for about 1,000 students by the end of the school year.",
      "It\u2019s not enough to make up for the lost service, said Erin Rose Schubert, a volunteer for the CPS Parents for Buses advocacy group.",
      "\u201cThe people who had the money and the privilege were able to figure out other situations like rearranging their work schedules or public transportation,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who didn\u2019t, some had to pull their kids out of school.\u201d",
      "On Piggyback Network, parents can book a ride for their student online with another parent traveling the same direction. Rides cost roughly 80 cents per mile and the drivers are compensated with credits to use for their own kids\u2019 rides.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for kids to not be late to school,\u201d 15-year-old Takia Phillips said on a recent PiggyBack ride with El-Amin as the driver.",
      "The company has arranged a few hundred rides in its first year operating in Chicago, and El-Amin has been contacting drivers for possible expansion to Virginia, North Carolina and Texas. It is one of several startups that have been filling the void.",
      "Unlike Piggyback Network, which connects parents, HopSkipDrive contracts directly with school districts to assist students without reliable transportation. The company launched a decade ago in Los Angeles with three mothers trying to coordinate school carpools and now supports some 600 school districts in 13 states.",
      "Regulations keep it from operating in some states, including Kentucky, where a group of Louisville students has been lobbying on its behalf to change that.",
      "After the district halted bus service to most traditional and magnet schools, the student group known as The Real Young Prodigys wrote a hip-hop song titled \u201cWhere My Bus At?\u201d The song\u2019s music video went viral on YouTube with lyrics such as, \u201cI\u2019m a good kid. I stay in class, too. Teachers want me to succeed, but I can\u2019t get to school.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose bus driver shortages are not really going away,\u201d HopSkipDrive CEO Joanna McFarland said. \u201cThis is a structural change in the industry we need to get serious about addressing.\u201d",
      "HopSkipDrive has been a welcome option for Reinya Gibson\u2019s son, Jerren Samuel, who attends a small high school in Oakland, California. She said the school takes care to accommodate his needs as a student with autism, but the district lined up the transportation because there is no bus from their home in San Leandro.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, people used to talk about kids in the short yellow buses. They were associated with a physical disability, and they were teased or made fun of,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cNobody knows this is support for Jerren because he can\u2019t take public transportation.\u201d",
      "Encouragement from his mother helped Jerren overcame his fear about riding with a stranger to school.",
      "\u201cI felt really independent getting in that car,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies catering to kids claim to screen drivers more extensively, checking their fingerprints and requiring them to have childcare or parenting experience. Drivers and children are often given passwords that must match, and parents can track a child\u2019s whereabouts in real time through the apps.",
      "Kango, a competitor to HopSkipDrive in California and Arizona, started as a free carpooling app similar to the PiggyBack Network and now contracts with school districts. Drivers are paid more than they would typically get for Uber or Lyft, but there are often more requirements such as walking some students with disabilities into school, Kango CEO Sara Schaer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a curbside-to-curbside, three-minute situation,\u201d Schaer said. \u201cYou are responsible for getting that kid to and from school. That\u2019s not the same as transporting an adult or DoorDashing somebody\u2019s lunch or dinner.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, some families that have used Piggyback said they have seen few alternatives.",
      "Concerned about the city\u2019s rising crime rate, retired police officer Sabrina Beck never considered letting her son take the subway to Whitney Young High School. Since she was driving him anyway, she volunteered through PiggyBack also to drive a freshman who had qualified for the selective magnet school but had no way to get there.",
      "\u201cTo have the opportunity to go and then to miss it because you don\u2019t have the transportation, that is so detrimental,\u201d Beck said. \u201cOptions like this are extremely important.\u201d",
      "After the bus route that took her two kids to elementary school was canceled, Jazmine Dillard and other Chicago parents thought they had convinced the school to move up the opening bell from 8:45 a.m. to 8:15 a.m., a more manageable time for her schedule. After that plan was scrapped because the buses were needed elsewhere at that time, Dillard turned to PiggyBack Network.",
      "\u201cWe had to kind of pivot and find a way to make it to work on time as well as get them to school on time,\u201d she said.",

      "The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility\u201d and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",
      "Cabell \u2014 a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid \u2014 expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year.",
      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is urging the federal government to deploy advanced drone-tracking technology following weeks of reported drone sightings in parts of New York and New Jersey that have stirred fear and bewilderment",
      "BOSTON -- After weeks of fear and bewilderment about the drones buzzing over parts of New York and New Jersey, elected officials are urging action to identify and stop the mysterious flights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "\u201c'We don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer,\u201d he said.",
      "National security officials have said the drones don\u2019t appear to be a sign of foreign interference or a public safety threat. But because they can\u2019t say with certainty who is responsible for the sudden swarms of drones over parts of New Jersey, New York and other eastern parts of the U.S. \u2014 or how they can be stopped \u2014 leaders of both political parties are demanding better technology and powers to deal with the drones.",
      "Sen. Chuck Schumer called Sunday for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to deploy better drone-tracking technology to identify the drones and their operators.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers have tremendous questions about it,\u201d Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters about the drone sightings. \u201cWe are going to get the answers for them.\u201d",
      "The federal government did little to answer those questions in its own media briefings Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "Some of the drones reported above parts of New York and New Jersey have turned out to be \u201cmanned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the Northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter.\u201d",
      "Last year, federal aviation rules began requiring certain drones to broadcast their remote identification, including the location of their operators. It\u2019s not clear whether that information has been used to determine who is behind the drones plaguing locations over New York and New Jersey. Mayorkas\u2019 office didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether they\u2019ve been able to identify drones using this capability.",
      "Schumer wants the federal government to use a recently declassified radio wave technology in New York and New Jersey. The radio wave detector can be attached to a drone or airplane and can determine whether another flying object is a bird or a drone, read its electronic registration, and follow it back to its landing place. Schumer said state and local authorities do not have the authority to track drones.",
      "On Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said federal officials were sending a drone detection system to the state.",
      "\u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The governor did not immediately provide additional details, including where the system will be deployed.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month over parts of New Jersey, raising concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Drones are now being reported all along the northern East Coast, with suspicious sightings in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to news reports.",
      "Some U.S. political leaders, including Trump, have called for much stronger action against the drones, including shooting them down.",
      "Certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security have the power to \u201cincapacitate\u201d drones, Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cBut we need those authorities expanded,\u201d he said.",
      "A bill before the U.S. Senate would enhance some federal agencies\u2019 authority and give new abilities to local and state agencies to track drones. It would also start a pilot program allowing states and local authorities to disrupt, disable or seize a drone without prior consent of the operator.",
      "\u201cWhat the drone issue points out are gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department,\" Rep.

      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",

      "A federal appeals court on Friday left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States, rejecting a request made by the company to halt enforcement until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge of the statute.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the nation's highest court will take up the case, though some legal experts have said they expect the justices to weigh in due to the types of novel questions it raises about social media, national security and the First Amendment. TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \u201csave\u201d the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.",
      "The court rejected that request on Friday, calling it \u201cunwarranted.\"",
      "\u201cThe petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,\u201d said the court's order, which was unsigned.",
      "The statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing\u2019s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government\u2019s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.",
      "In the request filed this week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a \u201cmodest delay\u201d in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could \u201cdetermine its position\u201d on the matter.",
      "If the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.",

      "The appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said."

    "story": [
      "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
      "It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct.",
      "But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal.",
      "\u201cYou can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,\u201d said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did.",
      "Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development.",
      "Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking.",
      "Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. \u201cIt was really a pretty significant species to lose,\u201d said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. \u201cThe more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.\u201d",
      "The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is \u2014 blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts.",
      "To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year.",
      "\u201cIt kind of stinks that it happened because now it\u2019s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,\" said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,\u201d Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance.",
      "Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world?",
      "A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbolic to say it\u2019s revolutionary\" for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country.",
      "Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it \u201crobust and well supported\u201d and \u201ccritically important to the success of the chestnut.\u201d",
      "Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. \u201cI think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?\"",
      "For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry.",
      "\u201cThe project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cI want to do something good for the future, for my children.\"",

      "CHATHAM, N.J. -- That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It's unclear if it's drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.",
      "Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.",
      "This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what's behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey's new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.",
      "More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it\u2019s saying. \u201cLet the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" he posted on his social media site.",
      "But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they're looking into what's happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.",
      "Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.",
      "In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.",
      "The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.",
      "One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it\u2019s otherworldly. \u201cStraight up orbs,\u201d the person says. Others weigh in to say it\u2019s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)",
      "Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she's glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.",
      "\u201cI find myself \u2014 instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house \u2014 checking it,\u201d she said.",
      "She doesn't buy what the governor said, that the drones aren't a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \u201ca national security\u202for public safety\u202fthreat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can you say it\u2019s not posing a threat if you don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why so many people are uneasy.\u201d",
      "Then there's the notion that people could misunderstand what they're seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.",
      "Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they're looking at.",
      "Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.",
      "\u201cIt represents the United States of America in 2024,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.\u201d",
      "Federal officials echo Austin's view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.",
      "That's not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.",
      "For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it\u2019s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.",
      "\u201cMy main goal is I don\u2019t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,\u201d he added.",

Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",

      "Murphy, a Democrat, made the request in a letter Thursday, noting that state and local law enforcement remain \u201chamstrung\u201d by existing laws and policies in their efforts to successfully counteract any nefarious activity of unmanned aircraft. He posted a copy of the letter on the social media platform X.",

    "summary": "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
    "story": [
      "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
      "You never forget your first time seeing a giant salamander, according to Andy Hill.",
      "He was a teenager, standing thigh-high in the Watauga River outside Boone, North Carolina, casting a line on an early fall day when he saw his first eastern hellbender. The salamander stretched 2 feet long and was camouflaged among rocks beneath the clear water.",
      "\u201cYou never lose your sense of wonder and otherworldliness when you see one,\u201d said Hill, who now works as the Watauga Riverkeeper for MountainTrue, a nonprofit protecting natural ecosystems in western North Carolina, home to part of the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
      "The ancient species, which evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs, was submitted for federal protection Friday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. If the proposal is adopted after a period of public comment, the creatures will be protected under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their population in the U.S. has rapidly declined in recent decades; dams, industry and even flooding worsened by climate change have threatened their habitat and ability to reproduce and find food. Today, just 12% of eastern hellbenders are successfully reproducing.",
      "Hellbenders in the Blue Ridge Mountains had been considered the healthiest population of the eastern subspecies but were devastated this fall by Hurricane Helene. Thousands were displaced or found dead amid rubble. Others were found in flooded church basements and returned to the river. But some rivers are so polluted, there\u2019s still a \u201cdo not touch\u201d advisory for people.",
      "Tierra Curry burst into tears when she learned of the proposed protection.",
      "\u201cI just think it's a moral failure that we're pushing them to the brink of extinction,\u201d said Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The slimy, brown creature with a broad, flat head may never win a beauty contest, but it is famous as the largest amphibian in North America.",
      "The hellbender breathes dissolved oxygen in the water through its skin. Water that becomes slow-moving, warm or polluted holds less oxygen.",
      "Over the past five years, two dams were removed on the Watauga River to help improve water quality and reconnect hellbender communities. The most recent one came down this summer \u2014 and two months later, Helene upended life not just for people, but also for animals like the salamander.",
      "For those working to ensure the species' survival, the newly proposed federal protection couldn't come soon enough, said Erin McCombs, Southeast conservation director for American Rivers.",
      "\u201cWe have to be paying more attention to the health of our nation's rivers and streams, and that means paying more attention to the critters that live in them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen species like the hellbender, which are reliant on free-flowing and clean water, are declining, alarms need to be going off, because we'll feel the impacts next.\u201d",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned and won protection for the Ozark subspecies of hellbenders in 2011 and for Missouri hellbenders, another population of eastern hellbender, in 2021. The group sued, seeking protection for all eastern hellbenders. As of this week, all hellbenders in the U.S. are protected or slated for protection under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Hill says he hopes the new federal protection will usher in \u201cbold strategies\u201d to help the species recover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a massive effort,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 07:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence related \u201centirely to unofficial conduct\u201d and \u201cposes no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence \"poses no danger\" to the executive branch.",
      "The New York judge in President-elect Donald Trump's criminal hush money case ruled Monday that the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision does not apply to that case.",
      "Trump had sought to dismiss his criminal indictment and vacate the jury verdict on the grounds that prosecutors, during the trial last May, introduced evidence relating to Trump's official acts as president, after the Supreme Court later ruled in July that Trump is entitled to presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.",
      "However, Judge Juan Merchan said on Monday that the evidence in Trump's hush money case related \"entirely to unofficial conduct\" and \"poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\"",
      "Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. Judge Merchan has yet to hand down a sentence.",
      "In his ruling Monday, Merchan found that there was \"overwhelming evidence of guilt\" that led the jury to convict Trump at trial.",
      "Trump's attorneys, arguing for immunity, had emphasized the importance of former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks' testimony, including her recounting of interactions with Trump in 2018 when reporting about the alleged hush money payment to Stormy Daniels broke, to demonstrate Trump's knowledge of the payment and his preference that the story came out after the election.",
      "Defense lawyers used a similar argument to argue that tweets from Trump -- which prosecutors used to demonstrate an alleged \"pressure campaign\" to prevent Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen from cooperating with authorities in 2018 -- were official communications protected by immunity because the posts \"fall well within the core authority of the Nation's Chief Executive.\"",
      "But Merchan on Monday rejected Trump's argument that the testimony of Hicks, Trump's Twitter posts about Cohen, and other evidence, constitute official acts.",
      "\"Just as the title of Communications Director does not bestow absolute immunity to any and all communications with Ms. Hicks, neither does mere reference to the Justice Department convert a Tweet to an official act,\" Merchan wrote in his ruling.",
      "\"It is therefore logical and reasonable to conclude that if the act of falsifying records to cover up the payments so that the public would not be made aware is decidedly an unofficial act, so too should the communications to further that same cover-up be unofficial,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Trump has also offered another argument that he is entitled to presidential immunity because he is now president-elect, which Merchan has yet to rule on.",
      "Last week, the Manhattan district attorney's office urged Merchan to preserve the jury's verdict and sentence Trump at some later date following his second term, but Trump's attorneys blasted that proposal as \"thuggish tactics.\"",
      "In a letter accompanying Monday's ruling, Merchan referenced a forthcoming filing from Trump's lawyers alleging \"juror misconduct,\" which has yet to be made public.",
      "Merchan wrote that Trump's argument \"consists entirely of unsworn allegations,\" but that he will allow the president-elect's lawyers to file a redacted version of their claims.",
      "\"Thus, this Court finds that to allow the public filing of the letters without redactions and without the benefit of a hearing would only serve to undermine the integrity of these proceedings while simultaneously placing the safety of the jurors at grave risk,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "The judge said that he would consider Trump's claims if he submitted a motion to throw out the case with sworn testimony backing up the allegation of juror misconduct, rather than the unsworn allegations provided by Trump's lawyers in their recent filing.",
      "\"Allegations of juror misconduct should be thoroughly investigated. However, this Court is prohibited from deciding such claims on the basis of mere hearsay and conjecture,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Merchan's letter did not provide any additional context about Trump's allegation of juror misconduct, and Trump's filings have not been posted to the court's public docket.",

      "During a wide-ranging impromptu press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, President-elect Donald Trump signaled an eagerness to wrap up the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as possible -- suggesting he would call on some of the combatants to make significant compromises.",
      "\u201cWe've been doing our best and we'll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSince the election, I\u2019ve been working every day to put the world at ease a little bit, to get rid of the wars.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously insisted he would need only 24 hours to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has now pressed on for more than 1,000 days. But on Monday, he said he anticipated that would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d to resolve than the current turmoil in the Middle East, which is rooted in the century-old Israeli Palestinian conflict.",
      "\u201cI see that as more difficult,\u201d Trump said, before decrying the Biden administration\u2019s recent decision to loosen restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of American-supplied arms in recent weeks, allowing Kyiv to strike deeper inside Russian territory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that should have been allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly not just weeks before I take over.",
      "Trump then said he might reverse the decision, adding \u201cI thought it was a very stupid thing to do.\u201d",
      "The president-elect also suggested he might expect Kyiv to hand over land to Russia as part of negotiated peace, signaling a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s longstanding policy that Ukraine should steer any discussion on making territorial concessions in order to end the war.",
      "\u201cAll those cities are destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's nice to say they want their land back, but the cities are largely destroyed.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before weighing in on how much land Ukraine should cede, but said it was still possible a deal to end the war could be reached before he entered the White House.",
      "He also spoke about the devastation the war had caused in vivid terms, without expressly blaming Moscow for igniting it.",
      "\u201cIt's a carnage that we haven't seen since the Second World War. It's got to be stopped. And I'm doing I'm doing my best to stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "The president-elect was also asked by ABC\u2019s Selina Wang if the Kremlin should have to hand over former Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, who fled rebel fighters by escaping to Russia.",
      "\u201cWell, I hadn't thought of it. I think we have to get on with our lives. I have to see what happens,\u201d Trump responded.",
      "The president-elect said he was already actively engaged on other matters related to the Middle East, saying he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend.",
      "Trump also reiterated a demand he made in a post on his Truth Social site earlier this month that all hostages held in Gaza should be released prior to his inauguration, saying otherwise there would be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY.\u201d",
      "Asked about what the consequences Hamas would face if all the detainees were not freed by that point, Trump responded \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to determine what that means.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it means it won\u2019t be pleasant,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements come as the State Department and some Israeli officials are signaling progress towards a limited deal to exchange some of the hostages held by Hamas for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "According to two U.S. officials familiar with the negotiations, Hamas has shown more willingness to compromise in recent days -- indicating it would temporarily tolerate the presence of some Israeli forces in the enclave during a ceasefire. The group has also provided information on some hostages Hamas said it would release as part of an agreement, they added.",
      "\u201cWe are we are pushing as hard as we know how to do at this point, and we believe we can get to a deal,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. \u201cIt remains incumbent on Hamas and Israel agreeing to those final terms and getting it over the line. And I can't good conscience tell you stand here and tell you that that's going to happen, but it should happen.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that the Biden administration knows more about the drones that have raised alarms over parts of the country than it's sharing with the public.",
      "\"They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump took questions for more than an hour on a number of subjects. He started his remarks with an announcement that SoftBank will make a $100 billion investment in the U.S. that will create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. SoftBank plans to complete the work before Trump leaves office in 2029, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Asked about a potential ban on TikTok unless it finds new ownership, Trump said he has \"a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" because of its effect on his winning a larger share of the youth vote than he did in 2016.",
      "A federal appeals court last week rejected TikTok's attempt to stop the pending ban and pause the Jan. 19 deadline for a sale.",
      "\"TikTok had an impact,\" Trump said. \"And, so we're taking a look at it. I don't know why, but we ended up finishing, we were, there was one poll that showed us down about 30. We were 35 or 36 points up with young people. So I have a little bit of a warm spot in my heart.\"",
      "Trump also said he would \"take a look\" at a pardon for New York Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted in September on bribery charges.",
      "\"I think that he was treated pretty unfairly,\" Trump said, and suggested the charges were retribution for Adams speaking out against migrants flooding into the country.",
      "\"It's very interesting when he essentially went against what was happening with the migrants coming in,\" Trump said. \"And, you know, he made some pretty strong statements like 'This is not sustainable.' I said, 'You know what? He'll be indicted soon.' And I said it. That is a prediction, a little bit lightheartedly, but I said it. I said, 'He's going to be indicted.' And a few months later he got indicted. So I would certainly look at it.\"",
      "Following reports last week that the personal attorney for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, had previously lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, the president-elect said he is a \"big believer in the polio vaccine.\"",
      "\"You're not gonna lose the polio vaccine. That's not gonna happen,\" he said. \"I saw what happened with the polio. I have friends that were very much affected by that. I have friends from many years ago, and they have obviously, they they're still in not such good shape because of it.\"",

      "Asked if Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to end the war, Trump didn't give a straight answer, instead saying cities there are a \u201cdemolition site\u201d and there\u2019s \u201cnothing there\u201d for Ukrainians.",
      "\u201cBut, a lot of that territory, when you look at what's happened to those, I mean, there are cities that there's not a building standing. It's a demolition site. There's not a building standing. So people can't go back to those cities. There's nothing there. It's just rubble,\u201d Trump said, hinting that there isn\u2019t a reason for Ukraine to keep the land.",
      "While calling the transition from the Biden administration to his incoming one \u201cfriendly,\u201d Trump called for a policy change on the border wall, claiming the White House was attempting to auction off border wall material.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with a smooth transition, that has to do with people really trying to stop our nation, and all it means really is that we're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more, not even talking about the time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt's almost a criminal act,\u201d Trump claimed as he lamented that border wall materials are being sold for \u201c5 cents on the dollar.\u201d",

      "Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., said Sunday that he has no concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence.",
      "Gabbard, a vocal non-interventionist, has seen her credentials come under scrutiny, particularly in light of a regime change in Syria and her covert meeting with former strongman Bashar Assad in 2017, which occurred after he had used chemical weapons on protesters. She later said Assad was \"not the enemy of the United States.\"",
      "\"I know Tulsi Gabbard. She's a patriot. She served our country honorably. She, I think, fits the reform agenda. President Trump ran on disrupting permanent Washington and having people who are going to view things differently,\" Schmitt told \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos. \"There's a lot of reform, George, that needs to happen in those agencies. Tulsi Gabbard is somebody who I think can execute on that.\"",
      "\"I don't think it's unusual for members of Congress to visit foreign countries and talk to foreign leaders,\" he said of the former Democratic congresswoman. \"President Trump, I think, believes in engaging in diplomacy, solving these things.\"",

      "\"I think that's a longer discussion, and a discussion that President Trump had in his first term,\" Schmitt said. \"I do think we're entering a new phase, though, of realism in this country. President Trump would be less interventionist, and we get back to our core national interests, principally defending the homeland, the Indo-Pacific and China.\"",
      "\"Understanding what terrorism means around the world is important, but having these trip wires in other regions that pull us into wars, I think the American people have had enough of that,\" he added when pressed on the risks of an ISIS resurgence if U.S. troops leave Syria.",

      "\"That agency is in desperate need of reform. Kash Patel is very qualified, and I think he's going to get the support in the Senate,\" Schmitt said.",
      "On Trump's promise to pardon Jan. 6 rioters, Schmitt said the president-elect would look at pardons on an individual basis and decipher between violent and non-violent offenders, which he said is the \"exact right approach.\"",
      "\"I think you do separate violent acts from non-violent acts, but I think he's been pretty clear he's going to view these individually,\" Schmitt said.",

    "story": [
      "The bill passed the Senate last week and awaits a House vote.",
      "Paris Hilton said she was shopping in Saks Fifth Avenue in New York last week when she heard The Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act -- a piece of legislation she\u2019s tirelessly lobbied for over the past three years -- had passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous support.",
      "The celebrity hotel heiress told ABC News that she was with her sister, \u201cdoing a little girls, sister holiday shopping,\u201d when she got a FaceTime call with the update that the bill, which would place greater federal safeguards on institutional youth treatment programs, had hit its first major legislative milestone.",
      "Hilton for years has been an outspoken, public advocate for reform in congregate care facilities and residential treatment programs for \"troubled\" minors. She\u2019s brazenly described her own traumatizing experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah when she was a teenager.",
      "\u201cWe were all just bawling, in tears, just so proud and so happy, and the whole survivor community is just -- everybody is just so so grateful and so happy, and they feel so validated that they're being listened to,\u201d the entrepreneur, DJ, model and actress told ABC News about her reaction to the bill\u2019s Senate passage on Wednesday.",
      "Now, with only a week left in the 118th Congress, Hilton is urging House leaders to prioritize the measure and bring it to the floor for a vote \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're all just hoping and praying that they'll do the right thing,\u201d said Hilton, who is headed back to Washington D.C. to meet with House members on Monday.",
      "\u201cI just really hope that they, you know, don't let politics stand in the way of saving children's lives. This is so urgent, because the House of Representatives has to pass this bill in the next week before the end of this year's session, or else the bill will die. We would have to do it all over again.\u201d",
      "ABC News did not receive a response from Speaker Mike Johnson on whether he'd consider bringing the legislation to the floor for a vote during the final week of the session. The legislation-- which would ordinarily need to pass through the House Energy and Commerce committee before it could get called by leaders to the floor-- is able to be fast-tracked by bypassing that step, according to a source familiar with committee business.",
      "\"When the U.S. Senate came together in a rare show of unity to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act unanimously on Wednesday December 11th, it was one of the best moments of my life. It was proof that when we listen to survivors and put politics aside, we can create real, meaningful change. But this journey isn\u2019t over. I can\u2019t celebrate until this bill becomes law, and now it\u2019s up to the U.S House of Representatives to finish what the Senate started,\" Hilton wrote in an open letter shared to her Instagram page on Monday.",
      "\"To Leader Scalise, Speaker Johnson, and every member of the House: I urge you to think about the children who can\u2019t speak for themselves. They\u2019re relying on us\u2014on you\u2014to stand up for their safety and dignity. Passing this bill would be a testament to what we can achieve when we lead with empathy and courage.\"",
      "Hilton has traveled to Washington every six to 10 months starting in October 2021, according to her spokesperson, each time asking Congress to reform youth residential treatment facilities.",
      "She\u2019s met individually with members like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who thanked Hilton after the bill\u2019s passage last week for her work on the issue, and Republicans like Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina.",
      "Some of her biggest advocates have been the cosponsors of the bill: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Hilton said.",
      "\"A lack of oversight and transparency in residential youth programs has allowed for the abuse of children in facilities across the country for far too long,\" Cornyn said in a statement after the bill passed.",
      "\"I'm proud that the Senate unanimously passed this legislation to ensure the vulnerable children in these facilities are protected, and I want to thank the countless advocates who have bravely shared their stories to help end institutional child abuse.\"",
      "Hilton also testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in June, emotionally recounting her experience being at Provo Canyon School as a teen.",
      "\u201cThese programs promised healing, growth, and support, but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely, or even look out a window for two years,\u201d she testified in 2023. \u201cI was force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff. I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked, and thrown into solitary confinement.\u201d",
      "The Provo school in Utah, which is still operating today, released an updated statement in June 2024 saying they couldn't comment on the operations or student experiences at the school prior to August 2000, when it had changed ownership shortly after Hilton's stint there. Provo said it did not \u201ccondone or promote any form of abuse,\" in their statement.",
      "Hilton has gone to the White House to advocate for child welfare, meeting with policy staff in May 2022. Should the bill pass through the House this week, it would land on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law before the end of his term. Hilton and her team expressed confidence in the president\u2019s willingness to sign the measure.",
      "\u201cWe have had some prior conversations with the White House about the bill, and we don't have a reason to believe that they wouldn't sign it into law,\u201d Hilton\u2019s spokesperson said.",
      "The socialite\u2019s push for congregate-care reform started in 2021, when she came to Washington in support of a similar measure, the Federal Accountability for Congregate Care Act, which was a different bill that was introduced in October 2021 and led by Khanna, Merkley, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and then-Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "Before her visit in 2021, Hilton had opened up about her 11-month experience at Provo Canyon school in her 2020 documentary \"This is Paris,\" and in a Washington Post op-ed.",
      "Hilton told ABC News that the lobbying process for her has been painful but also cathartic.",
      "\u201cIt's been a lot of work\u2026it's not easy to speak about so many things are so painful and traumatic, but I know that it's so important just to be able to be a voice for those who don't, and I'm so grateful to be able to use my platform and my voice just to ensure that no more children are traumatized in the name of treatment,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been also just a very healing experience to see what an impact it's made\u2026it's been just incredibly healing and cathartic.\u201d",
      "Hilton is in New York with her friend and \"The Simple Life\" co-star Nicole Richie to promote a reboot of their iconic show, but said her work on issues related to the troubled teen industry was her most significant venture.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of a lot of things in my life, but the work -- my advocacy work that I'm doing to protect children -- is the thing that I'm most proud of, and this is what I want my legacy to be,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "If the bill doesn\u2019t pass this session, Hilton said she would continue to fight for the issue.",
      "\u201cI won't stop fighting until change is made. This is my lifelong mission and I really believe it's my true purpose in life. I will not stop fighting for these children and being a voice for them.\u201d",

      "Katie Miller, a transition spokesperson, said Kennedy and Siri have never spoken about Siri's petitions.",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy believes the polio vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Richard Besser, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an ABC News contributor, said senators should ask Kennedy if he would consider using his new post to discourage local school districts from requiring vaccinations.",
      "While state -- not federal -- laws establish vaccination requirements for local schools, they rely heavily on the recommendations by the CDC and FDA, which Kennedy would oversee as health secretary, if confirmed. Currently, all 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring vaccines to attend schools, although many offer exemptions.",
      "\"What will you do to make sure that parents can feel comfortable sending their children to school protected from measles, whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable diseases if vaccines are no longer required?\" Besser said senators should be asking Kennedy.",
      "On questioning the polio vaccine, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history and a polio survivor, said last week that anyone seeking Senate confirmation would \"do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\"",
      "Confirmation bias is the idea that people often seek out information that supports their own deeply held beliefs, rather than be open to accepting new information that might challenge their ideas.",
      "When it comes to the polio vaccination, Kennedy has said he's willing to say that he's wrong but that he has yet to see information that would convince him.",
      "\"If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong ... I'm going to put that on my Twitter and I'm going to say I was wrong,\" he said in a podcast last year with Lex Fridman.",
      "It's likely several senators will ask Kennedy whether he'd be willing to change his mind on vaccines based on data, or if he's already convinced that the data is wrong or manipulated.",
      "Critics say Kennedy is willfully ignoring the information that's out there already. In a letter obtained by The New York Times, more than 75 Nobel Prize winners urged senators to block his nomination, citing his \"lack of credentials or relative experience\" in matters of medicine, science and public health.",
      "\"In view of his record, placing Mr. Kennedy in charge of [the Department of Health and Human Services] would put the public's health in jeopardy and undermine America's global leadership in the health sciences, in both the public and commercial sectors,\" the laureates wrote.",
      "Kennedy finds the most political consensus when he talks about America's obesity crisis and blames the high levels of sugar, sodium and fat in ultra-processed foods. A longtime environmental advocate, he's also taken aim at the use of additives pushed by food companies -- earning him kudos from some Democrats.",
      "\"We're prioritizing corporations feeding us unhealthy products instead of family farmers growing fresh, healthy foods - and we let too many dangerous chemicals flood our food system,\" said Sen. Cory Booker last month after Kennedy's nomination was announced.",
      "\"We all must come together to build a system that works for all,\" he added.",
      "But one big question many senators will likely ask is how Kennedy plans to turn around America's eating habits in a way that doesn't hurt U.S. farmers or heavily regulate agricultural businesses that are key political supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. During Trump's first administration, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue rolled back Obama-era rules that sought to limit sodium and sugar in children's school lunches that accept federal subsidies.",
      "FDA Administrator Robert Califf, who will step down when Trump takes office in January, testified recently before a Senate committee that there's a lot we still don't know about food science and safety. When the FDA does move ahead with regulation, he said the rule is often challenged in court.",
      "\"What sounds simple, given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, [is] the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals -- every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress -- it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Rep. Nancy Mace has made headlines for her rhetoric around the transgender community, including her efforts to ban transgender women from using women's restrooms.",
    "story": [
      "Mace used to call herself \"pro-transgender\" and \"pro-LGBTQ.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace has recently made headlines and faced protests for her rhetoric around the transgender community, particularly for her efforts to ban transgender women from using women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol just as the first transgender representative has been elected to Congress.",
      "This month, Mace, R-S.C., used a slur against the transgender community in a video on social media. She used the term in reference to protesters who demonstrated in the halls of Congress against the trans bathroom ban.",
      "Now Mace is back in the headlines for accusing foster youth advocate James McIntyre of assault. According to court documents obtained by ABC News, McIntyre allegedly approached Mace to shake her hand after she spoke at an event to celebrate the 25th anniversary of legislation benefiting foster youth.",
      "Mace claimed to officials that \u201cthe subject began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion. The effect of the motion was described as her arm flailing for about 3-5 seconds.\u201d",
      "McIntryre is said to have stated \u201ctrans youth deserve advocacy\u201d during the interaction. Mace told police she had pain in her wrists, arm and armpits due to the incident, but refused assistance from paramedics. McIntyre was arrested and has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting a government official.",
      "In a post on X following the incident, Mace called McIntyre \"a pro-tr*ns man.\"",
      "Mace's recent remarks appear to be a shift from her comments in years past, when she had referred to herself as \u201cpro-transgender\u201d and \u201cpro-LGBTQ.\u201d",
      "ABC News has reached out to Mace's office for comment.",
      "Prior to the legislation to ban transgender women from Capitol bathrooms, Mace supported the \"Fairness for All Act,\" expressed support for socially transitioning youth and faced backlash for what critics called her pro-transgender support.",
      "2021: Mace says she supports \u2018LGBTQ rights and equality\u2019",
      "In an interview with the Washington Examiner in 2021, Mace told a reporter: \"I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality ... no one should be discriminated against.\"",
      "In the interview, she discussed her opposition to the Equality Act, which would expand federal civil rights laws to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. She instead supported the \u201cFairness for All Act,\u201d which was aimed at banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity but allowing certain exceptions for religious organizations.",
      "According to the outlet, Mace agreed that, for example, secular companies shouldn\u2019t be able to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 but that religious organizations do not have to \u201cviolate their moral or religious conscience,\u201d the outlet wrote.",
      "\"It isn\u2019t a black-and-white issue,\" Mace said in the interview. \"I do believe that religious liberty, the First Amendment, gay rights, and transgender equality can all coexist. I\u2019m also a constitutionalist, and we have to ensure anti-discrimination laws don\u2019t violate First Amendment rights or religious freedom.\"",
      "She told the outlet she has \u201cfriends and family that identify as LGBTQ \u2026 Understanding how they feel and how they\u2019ve been treated is important. Having been around gay, lesbian, and transgender people has informed my opinion over my lifetime.\"",
      "At the time, she said younger conservatives were becoming more supportive of LGBTQ rights: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want the government in their bedrooms or their board rooms.\"",
      "2022: Mace faces attack ads for her views",
      "In the 2022 primary race, Mace was the subject of political attack ads from the conservative American Principles PAC targeting her for her pro-transgender support.",
      "The ad claimed Mace supported \u201cmen in girls\u2019 locker rooms, men in women\u2019s prisons, and even men in battered women\u2019s shelters,\" referring to transgender women as men.",
      "2023: Mace appears to support social transitioning for minors",
      "In a 2023 interview with CBS News, Mace said: \u201cI'm pro-transgender rights. I'm pro-LGBTQ. Just don't go to the extreme with our kids.\"",
      "She spoke about her support for bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, stating that\u00a0\"sex change surgery, the hormone blockers that sterilize our children. We shouldn't be doing that.\" Medical experts have said puberty blockers are reversible and do not permanently sterilize patients.",
      "However, Mace appeared to express support for youth who are socially transitioning: \u201cIf they wanna take on a different pronoun or a different gender identity or grow their hair out, or wear a dress or wear pants, or do those things as a minor\u2014those are all things that I think most people would support. Be who you want to be, but don\u2019t make permanent changes as a child,\u201d Mace said.",
      "2024: Mace introduces bathroom ban amid rise in anti-LGBTQ sentiment",
      "In November, Mace introduced a measure to ban transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms at the U.S. Capitol, targeting Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, the first transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "\"Yes, and absolutely. And then some,\" Mace told reporters at the Capitol when asked about whether the legislation was in response to McBride's election.",
      "\"I'm not going to stand for a man, you know, someone with a penis, in the women's locker room,\" she said.",
      "Mace invoked her own experiences as a victim of rape as part of the reason she introduced the measure.",
      "\"That's not OK. And I'm a victim of abuse myself. I'm a rape survivor,\" Mace said. \"I have PTSD from the abuse I've suffered at the hands of a man, and I know how vulnerable women and girls are in private spaces, so I'm absolutely 100% going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women's restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms. I will be there fighting you every step of the way,\" she said.",
      "McBride responded to the bill on X: \"This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.\"",
      "After House Speaker Mike Johnson said transgender women cannot use women's restrooms in the Capitol and House office buildings, McBride responded to imposed rules: \"I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.\"",
      "Each representative's office has a private restroom and unisex restrooms are also available throughout the Capitol.",
      "Opponents of the ban say that the narrative around \"fear\" and \"personal safety\" concerning transgender use of bathrooms is rooted in discrimination. They argue transgender people aren't inherently dangerous and are actually more likely to be victims of violence than cisgender people.",
      "Mace said she wanted to expand her efforts and push a measure that would ban transgender women from using women's bathrooms on all federal property: \"This shouldn't be going on any federal property. If you're a school or an institution that gets government funding, this kind of thing should be banned,\" she said.",
      "Transgender people -- who make up less than 1% of Americans over the age of 13, according to UCLA's research organization, the Williams Institute -- have been the subjects of hundreds of Republican-backed bills across the country in recent years.",
      "When protesters entered the Capitol to protest efforts to restrict transgender bathroom use in early December, Mace responded with a video on X, where she called protesters a derogatory slur for transgender people.",

      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",

      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",

      "The New Orleans Police Department has been plagued for decades by corruption and is pushing to finally end more than a decade of federal oversight",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Police Department, plagued for decades by corruption, is pushing to finally end more than a decade of federal oversight, amid lingering memories of a 1994 murder ordered by a crooked cop and an attempted cover-up in the 2005 killing of unarmed civilians.",
      "Department critics are expected to voice opposition to lifting court-ordered federal oversight at a hearing Tuesday in federal court, likely raising concerns before a federal judge over racial disparities in police use of force, poor handling of sex crimes and lackluster community engagement.",
      "To what extent federal oversight meaningfully changed the NOPD is particularly relevant as a cadre of high-ranking former NOPD officers and one of the lawyers overseeing the city consent decree are now responsible for managing a state-level reform plan for the Minneapolis police department in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder.",
      "In 2011, the Department of Justice investigation found evidence of racial bias, misconduct and a culture of impunity in the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). Two years later, the City of New Orleans entered into what it described as \u201cthe nation\u2019s most expansive\" federal oversight plan \u2014 a reform pact known as a consent decree \u2014 to fix the city's police force.",
      "NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said in an interview that the department has fulfilled these goals: \u201cWe\u2019ve built that system.\" If the federal judge agrees with the city and the Department of Justice motion to end the consent decree filed in September, the NOPD will remain under federal oversight for an additional two-year sustainment period.",
      "Almost everyone is willing to acknowledge the NOPD of today is in many ways a transformed department. But a range of prominent community activists and watchdogs say the NOPD is still not yet ready to relinquish federal oversight.",
      "Stella Cziment, who heads the Office of the Independent Police Monitor, a civilian-run city agency, said that while the NOPD has made significant strides improving its internal policies and leadership, it has focused more on meeting federal benchmarks and not enough as a whole to work with community members to reshape the department.",
      "\u201cI think the danger of the consent decree is that we lose sight of who the true audience is supposed to be of these police reforms,\u201d Cziment said. \u201cAnd ultimately, it is the community that is going to be served by the NOPD, needs to feel included by the NOPD, heard by the NOPD. And I cannot say today that that has been achieved.\u201d",
      "In recent years, the NOPD and the City of New Orleans has weathered payroll fraud allegations, a high-profile corruption charge involving the mayor\u2019s bodyguard and a backlog of unsolved rape cases, among other problems raised by watchdogs.",
      "Despite these ongoing issues, Rafael Goyeneche, president of a local anti-corruption nonprofit, the Metropolitan Crime Commission, said federal oversight of the NOPD and its upwards of 900 members should be seen as a \u201csuccess story\" \u2014 especially in light of the department's history.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, there will probably never be a day in any department of this size where some officers are violating the rules, some officers haven\u2019t crossed the line,\u201d Goyeneche said. \u201cBut that is not going to necessarily mean that the entire department is corrupt or mismanaged.\u201d",
      "Federal monitors have said the consent decree should be seen as the floor, not the ceiling for policing in New Orleans.",
      "Jonathan Aronie, the lead federal monitor, has praised the NOPD for improving its policies, training and auditing. The department now produces accurate data allowing auditors \u2014 and the public \u2014 to better track policing practices and bolster accountability, he has said.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at the collection of all these data, we no longer see a pattern of practice of unconstitutional conduct,\u201d Aronie said at an Oct. 28 public meeting.",
      "For many residents in a city that is just over 50% Black, distrust of the NOPD runs deep and the department's data still reveals troubling disparities. Nearly 90% of all instances of police use of force targeted Black people last year, the city's Office of the Independent Police Monitor reported.",
      "More than a decade ago, the Department of Justice's investigation highlighted similar rates of racial disparities in use of force against Black people as well as disproportionate arrest rates, calling for \u201ca searching review and a meaningful response\" from the NOPD.",
      "\u201cIf we haven\u2019t achieved the goal, why would we eliminate a structure that protects New Orleanians civil rights?\u201d Rachel Taber, an organizer with local immigrant rights group Uni\u00f3n Migrante, said.",
      "Confronted by community activists at a recent public meeting with data indicating these racial disparities, Aronie said federal oversight focused on improving the police department's policies and structures given \"the difficulties of solving bias in the same way it exists across almost every institution in the U.S.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would like to live in a city where those differences in practice reflect in the statistics before NOPD exits oversight,\u201d Zunyana Crier, an activist with the group New Orleans for Community Oversight of Police, responded.",
      "The NOPD's superintendent said in an interview that the department takes the data on racial disparities \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and continues to probe the reasons for them.",
      "\u201cWhen we see disparities, we then ask the question, is there a bias behind the disparity? Not all disparities equal bias,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Federal oversight mandated biennial surveys of New Orleanians experiences with and perceptions of the NOPD, but an updated survey has not been released since 2019 due to COVID-19 related public health concerns according to federal monitors, leaving it difficult to fully gauge how residents view their police department.",
      "The City of New Orleans has also lapsed in fully carrying out plans for community advisory boards, intended to give residents across different neighborhoods an opportunity to provide feedback directly to the NOPD. That program had largely been left to \u201cwither and die\u201d acknowledged NOPD Deputy Superintendent Nicholas Gernon at a recent public meeting, though he said the city intended to fix it.",
      "W.C. Johnson, a longtime community activist opposed to ending the consent decree, said he and others had grown cynical over the years with the NOPD's willingness to work with residents: \u201cWhen you\u2019re not being taken seriously, when you\u2019re not being included, why waste time?\u201d",
      "Police accountability groups have also expressed concerns over the lack of Spanish and Vietnamese language accessibility in the monthslong period of public comment \u2014 given the two group's large presence in the city \u2014 after the city filed the motion to wind down federal oversight.",
      "And they have said at public meetings that they perceive some on the federal monitoring team and the NOPD to have significant incentives to cast their decade-long work in New Orleans in a positive light.",
      "During a sparsely attended public meeting on Oct. 29, one member of the federal monitoring team, Ashley Burns, openly criticized her colleague, deputy monitor David Douglass along the same lines. Douglass, a lawyer whose nonprofit Effective Law Enforcement for All won a contract this year to oversee the Minneapolis police department's state-imposed reform plan, has hired a range of former NOPD personnel in his organization.",
      "\u201cI agree with the community, I think it\u2019s a great, great, great conflict of interest among a lot of other ethical and integrity issues,\" Burns told Douglass in the meeting. \u201cYou don\u2019t give a damn about Minneapolis or the people of New Orleans.\u201d",
      "Douglass has denied any conflict of interest and in a brief interview championed the NOPD's evolution: \u201cMany of the practices here are serving as a model for the nation and for other departments.\"",

      "A Minnesota man convicted of first-degree murder faces sentencing Tuesday for killing his girlfriend, whose 2023 disappearance after she dropped off their kids at daycare drew national attention and prompted thousands of volunteers to join in the search",
      "WINONA. Minn. -- A Minnesota man convicted of first-degree murder faces sentencing Tuesday for killing his girlfriend, whose 2023 disappearance after she dropped off their kids at daycare drew national attention and prompted thousands of volunteers to join the search for her.",
      "A jury found Adam Fravel, 30, of Mabel, guilty in November. He was arrested in June 2023, days after deputies found the body of Madeline Kingsbury in a wooded area a few miles away from a property owned by Fravel\u2019s parents.",
      "The 26-year-old Kingsbury vanished in March 2023 after dropping off her and Fravel\u2019s two young children at daycare in Winona, a southeastern Minnesota city of about 26,000 residents.",
      "The trial was moved to Mankato, about 136 miles (219 kilometers) west of Winona, because of extensive pretrial publicity. Fravel will be sentenced back in Winona by District Judge Nancy Buytendorp. Premeditated first-degree murder, the most serious of the four counts on which he was convicted, carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison.",
      "Police found Kingsbury\u2019s body in a culvert along a gravel road, in a gray fitted bed sheet that had been closed with black Gorilla tape. Prosecutor Phil Prokopowicz said she was strangled with a towel and that a medical examiner concluded she likely died of asphyxiation. The towel, bedsheet and tape matched items found in their Winona home, Prokopowicz said during the trial.",
      "Prokopowicz and witnesses said Kingsbury had been planning to leave Fravel for another man after becoming frustrated with his alleged abusive behavior and inadequate contributions to their family. He responded to those plans by killing her, the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cThe relationship was never about them,\u201d Prokopowicz said in his closing statement. \u201cIt was always about him.\u201d",
      "Witnesses testified they had seen bruises on Kingsbury\u2019s neck. In one instance, a friend said she was on a video call with Kingsbury when Fravel allegedly hit her. Another friend testified that Kingsbury told her Fravel had warned Kingsbury that she could end up like Gabby Petito, a woman who was killed by her boyfriend in a high-profile 2021 case.",
      "Fravel did not testify in his own defense. His attorney, Zach Bauer, said in his closing argument that the case against Fravel relied on \u201ctunnel vision, revisionist history and secret truths.\u201d He contended that there was no sign of any physical struggle inside the couple\u2019s home. He also pointed to testimony from a neighbor who claimed to have never heard the couple argue."

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A 15-year-old student opened fire inside a study hall at a small Christian school in Wisconsin, killing a teacher and a teenager and prompting a swarm of police officers to descend on the school in response to a second grader's 911 call.",
      "The girl also wounded six others in Monday's shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, including two students who were in critical condition, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. A teacher and three students were taken to a hospital with less serious injuries, and two of them were later released.",
      "\u201cEvery child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a victim forever. ... We need to figure out and try to piece together what exactly happened,\" Barnes said.",
      "Police said the shooter, identified as Natalie Rupnow, was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound when officers arrived and died en route to a hospital. Barnes declined to offer additional details about the shooter, partly out of respect for the family.",

      "Barbara Wiers, the school's director of elementary and school relations, said when they practice safety routines, leaders always announce that it's a drill. That didn\u2019t happen Monday, just a week before Christmas break.",
      "\u201cWhen they heard, \u2018Lockdown, lockdown,\u2019 they knew it was real,\u201d she said.",

      "A motive for the shooting was not immediately known, nor was it clear if the victims were targeted, Barnes said.",

      "Barnes said police were talking with the shooter\u2019s father and other family members, who were cooperating, and searching the shooter's home.",
      "\u201cHe lost someone as well,\" Barnes said of the shooter's father. \"And so we\u2019re not going to rush the information. We\u2019ll take our time and make sure we do our due diligence.\u201d",
      "The first 911 call to report an active shooter came in shortly before 11 a.m. First responders who were in training just 3 miles (about 5 kilometers) away dashed to the school for an actual emergency, Barnes said. They arrived three minutes after the initial call.",
      "Investigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.",
      "Police blocked off roads around the school, and federal agents were at the scene to assist local law enforcement. No shots were fired by police.",
      "Children and families were reunited at a health clinic about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the school. Parents pressed children against their chests while others squeezed hands and shoulders as they walked side by side.",

      "Bethany Highman, the mother of a student, rushed to the school and learned over FaceTime that her daughter was OK.",

    "story": [
      "Indiana officials are set to carry out the state's first execution in 15 years on a man convicted in the 1997 killings of four people, including his brother and his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9",
      "MICHIGAN CITY, Indiana -- An Indiana man convicted in the 1997 killings of his brother and three other people is set to receive a lethal injection by early Wednesday in the state's first execution in 15 years.",
      "Joseph Corcoran, 49, has been on death row in Indiana since 1999, the year he was convicted in the shootings of his brother, 30-year-old James Corcoran, his sister's fianc\u00e9, 32-year-old Robert Scott Turner, and two other men: Timothy G. Bricker, 30, and Douglas A. Stillwell, 30.",
      "Barring last-minute court action or intervention by Gov. Eric Holcomb, Corcoran is set to be put to death before sunrise Wednesday at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to state officials. Last summer, the governor announced the resumption of state executions after a yearslong hiatus marked by a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide.",
      "The state has provided few details about the process, including a specific execution time. No media witnesses will be permitted under state law. Indiana prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber in advance, showing a space that looks like a sparse operating room with a gurney, bright fluorescent lighting, a floor drain and interior windows to an adjacent viewing room.",
      "Corcoran's attorneys have fought the death penalty sentence for years, arguing that Corcoran is severely mentally ill, which affects his ability to understand and make decisions. Corcoran exhausted his federal appeals in 2016. Earlier this month, his attorneys asked the Indiana Supreme Court to stop his execution but the request was denied.",
      "However, attorneys say since the justices were split 3-2 that signals there's a chance.",
      "\u201cGiven that it is a close case, it shouldn\u2019t be rushed through,\u201d said defense attorney Larry Komp. \u201cHe\u2019s so extremely mentally ill. We think he\u2019s irrational. We\u2019ve never had a fair process.\u201d",
      "Attorneys have said one sign of Corcoran's mental illness includes a handwritten affidavit that Corcoran wrote to the justices this month saying he was done litigating his case.",
      "\u201cI am guilty of the crime I was convicted of, and accept the findings of all the appellate courts,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to court records, before Corcoran fatally shot the four victims in July 1997, he was under stress because the forthcoming marriage of his sister to Turner would necessitate moving out of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, home he shared with his brother and sister.",
      "He awoke to hear his brother and others downstairs talking about him, loaded his rifle and then shot all four men, records show. While jailed, Corcoran reportedly bragged about fatally shooting his parents in 1992 in northern Indiana\u2019s Steuben County. He was charged in their killings but acquitted.",
      "If Corcoran is put to death as scheduled by early Wednesday, it will be the state\u2019s first execution since 2009. In that time, 13 executions were carried out in Indiana but those were initiated and performed by federal officials in 2020 and 2021 at a federal prison in Terre Haute.",
      "Indiana\u2019s last state execution was in 2009 when Matthew Wrinkles was put to death for killing his wife, her brother and sister-in-law in 1994.",
      "State officials have said they couldn\u2019t continue executions because a combination of drugs used in lethal injections had become unavailable.",
      "For years, there has been a shortage across the country because pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell their products for that purpose. That\u2019s pushed states, including Indiana, to turn to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs specifically for a client. Some use more accessible drugs such as the sedatives pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause intense pain.",
      "Last week, Corcoran's attorneys filed a petition in U.S. District Court of Northern Indiana asking the court to stop the execution and hold a hearing to decide if it would be unconstitutional because Corcoran has a serious mental illness. They cited \u201csevere and longstanding paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d But the court rejected the bid to intervene on Friday, prompting attorneys to file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.",
      "Multiple groups, including religious groups and disability rights advocates, have opposed the execution. Several activists were planning a vigil starting late Tuesday outside the prison, about 60 miles (90 kilometers) east of Chicago.",
      "In early December, Indiana Disability Rights asked the governor to commute Corcoran\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.",
      "Holcomb recently said he would let the legal process \u201cplay out\u201d in Corcoran's case before deciding whether to intervene.",
      "One of Corcoran\u2019s sisters, Kelly Ernst, who lost both a brother and her fianc\u00e9 in the 1997 shootings, said she believes the death penalty should be abolished and her brother\u2019s execution won\u2019t solve or change anything. She is not planning to be present for the execution.",
      "Ernst said she had been out of contact with her brother for 10 years until recently.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words. I\u2019m just really upset that they\u2019re doing it close to Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister and I, our birthdays are in December. I mean, it just feels like it\u2019s going to ruin Christmas for the rest of our lives. That\u2019s just what it feels like.\u201d",

      "It's about as American an idea as it gets -the hunger to make your own path, to find your own way, make your voice heard",
      "NEW YORK -- The chairs stay occupied at 12 Pell.",
      "Client after client, they come through the tiny barbershop on a narrow side street in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. They come for the cuts, sure. But really, they\u2019re coming for the cool.",
      "From New York City, from the metro area, from many states away, they\u2019re coming for what they see on 12 Pell\u2019s lively social media accounts, where the young, predominantly Asian American barbers offer advice to teens and men of all ages and ethnicities with humor, quips, confidence and ease \u2014 and not a hint of hesitation.",
      "Karho Leung, 34, embodies that. A son of Chinatown and one of the founders of 12 Pell, he wanted to start a business that reflected him \u2013 his creativity, his longstanding interest in fashion and style, his desire for \u201cbuilding the world that I want to live in \u2026 not asking for permission.\u201d",
      "About as American an idea as it gets, right? The hunger to make your own path, to find your own way, make your voice heard? In some ways, Leung is a case study for the latest incarnation of this. A look at social media and pop culture shows plenty of other Asian Americans of his and younger generations doing the same \u2014 in business, in politics, in content creation, in entertainment, in life.",
      "If the space isn't already there, they're determined to create it.",
      "Any look at the country\u2019s past shows that such an American reality hasn't always belonged to everyone, including previous generations of Asian Americans. That American notion of having the freedom to stake out your own space? Oftentimes, that has meant less space for others.",
      "Earlier generations of Asian Americans, some of whom have been here for well over a century and others whose roots trace to recent decades, have lived in Americas where their immigrant-origin communities were smaller and regarded as intrinsically, unceasingly foreign. Americas where there was little mainstream familiarity with the countries Asians and Asian Americans traced their ancestries to, where there was no Internet or social media culture that encouraged people to define their own lives.",
      "Instead, there were stereotypes that persist to this day \u2014 of otherness, of broken-English speaking and passiveness, at times sneaky or suspicious, often eating some kind of strange, pungent food. Other iterations included nerds and geeks who could be assumed to ace the math test more readily than score the winning point in the game or being fashionable enough to offer style guidance.",
      "But even as those stereotypes still do harm, they don\u2019t have the same power in a country and time when many Americans now eat from a global plate; where yoga studios and henna tattoos, temples and cultural festivals are everywhere; where Asian American creators have some room to tell their own stories; and where the size, variety and geography of Asian American communities have increased dramatically in the last 20 years even as they remain a small part of the overall whole.",
      "Those stereotypes don\u2019t touch Leung \u2014 born in Maine and raised since childhood in Chinatown \u2014 the same way they impacted generations before him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because even though I watched this type of stereotype and portrayal happen growing up, it never really resonated or hit me that that was what I was up against,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma that existed, but I always drove in my own lane.\u201d",
      "Just ask Jeff Yang, 56, a writer who has spent decades chronicling Asian American communities and culture. When he's asked if the cultural space that Leung inhabits and makes his own sounds like the world of Yang\u2019s childhood, he laughs.",
      "\u201cI grew up in a world where I felt like everything about me was projected on me by other people,\u201d Yang says. \u201cThe stories that were being told were all told by non-Asians about what I could do, who I could be, what I could look like.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not as if that world doesn\u2019t still exist. Simran Anand, 27, was still part of just one of three South Asian families in Reading, Pennsylvania, growing up in the 2000s. She can relate, she says, to the sense earlier generations had of feeling culturally isolated in her day-to-day life when she stepped out of the family home.",
      "But she had something they lacked \u2014 large-scale South Asian communities, like in Edison, New Jersey, where her parents went at least quarterly. A Sikh gurdwara about an hour away where she could learn about her faith. And the option, when she got to college, of choosing a school where she could join thriving South Asian student groups.",
      "For her, it\u2019s both-and, not either-or, a sensibility she takes to her jewelry company, BySimran, which she started a couple of years ago to create pieces that drew inspiration from South Asian designs but have been adapted to fit her sensibilities as a young American woman as well.",
      "\u201cI am American, but I\u2019m also South Asian,\" she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to be one or the other.\u201d",
      "Demetri Manabat, 23, agrees. Born and raised in Las Vegas to a Filipino father and Mexican mother, the spoken word artist readily acknowledges \u201cit sounds like a different world\u201d to hear his parents\u2019 experiences growing up.",
      "They didn\u2019t teach him or his brothers Tagalog, one of the languages of the Philippines, or Spanish because \u201cthey grew up in a time where that was kind of frowned upon to be speaking a different language. And so they were under the assumption that that kind of perception would continue throughout my years, which it didn\u2019t.\"",
      "\u201cI always used to get so mad at my parents like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you teach me a language?\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t until recently that I was finally kind of able to grasp, it was nothing like it is now.\u201d",
      "Alex Paik remembers. The 43-year-old Korean American artist came of age in a predominantly white suburb outside of Philadelphia and now lives in Los Angeles. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was like I either was not Korean enough or too Korean\" \u2014 caught between his immigrant parents\u2019 standards and the America around him, he says. \u201cI felt like I was trying to measure up to these always moving goalposts.\u201d",
      "Today, he\u2019s intrigued watching his 11-year-old daughter. \u201cShe loves to read, and there\u2019s so many stories now that are written by Asian American women that center Asian and Asian American girls as protagonists and I think that\u2019s so cool,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would affect your sense of self, but it must affect it somehow, so I\u2019m really curious to see how she grows up \u2026 It\u2019s just normal for her.\u201d",
      "He, Yang and others point to multiple factors that have impacted the lives of Asian Americans over time, including the demographic reality that there are more, and bigger, communities across the country largely due to the 1965 reform of immigration laws. Globalization has played a hand as well, introducing cultures to each other as the world has gotten smaller. And there\u2019s no overstating the role of the internet and technology.",
      "Of course, there have always been those in America\u2019s communities of Asian descent willing to be the groundbreakers, the pioneers in politics, protest, business, entertainment and art. DJ Rekha is among them. In 1997, Rekha started Basement Bhangra, a monthly party at a Manhattan club that would last for 20 years and was the introduction for many to the beats and rhythm of Bhangra, a musical style originating in the Indian subcontinent.",
      "\u201cWhat I was thinking is not dissimilar from what anyone else who\u2019s trying to create something is,\u201d Rekha says. \u201cYou want to hopefully do things that feel authentic to you, that have an audience who connects with it.\u201d",
      "Paik thinks some of what he\u2019s seeing in younger generations is also the natural outpouring that comes from a connection to the country that looks different to those born here than it does for immigrants.",

    "story": [
      "At a time of heightened political division, Americans\u2019 confidence in their country\u2019s judicial system and courts dropped to a record low of 35% this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- At a time of heightened political division, Americans' confidence in their country\u2019s judicial system and courts dropped to a record low of 35% this year, according to a new Gallup poll.",
      "The United States saw a sharp drop of 24 percentage points over the last four years, setting the country apart from other wealthy nations where most people on average still express trust in their systems.",
      "The results come after a tumultuous period that included the overturning of the nationwide right to abortion, the indictment of former President Donald Trump and the subsequent withdrawal of federal charges, and his attacks on the integrity of the judicial system.",
      "The drop wasn\u2019t limited to one end of the political spectrum. Confidence dropped among people who disapproved of the country's leadership during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and among those who approved, according to Gallup. The respondents weren\u2019t asked about their party affiliations.",
      "It\u2019s become normal for people who disapprove of the country\u2019s leadership to also lose at least some confidence in the court system. Still, the 17-point drop recorded among that group under Biden was precipitous, and the cases filed against Trump were likely factors, Gallup said.",
      "Among those who did approve of the country\u2019s leadership, there was an 18-point decline between 2023 and 2024, possibly reflecting dissatisfaction with court rulings favoring Trump, Gallup found. Confidence in the judicial system had been above 60% among that group during the first three years of Biden\u2019s presidency but nosedived this year.",
      "Trump had faced four criminal indictments this year, but only a hush-money case in New York ended with a trial and conviction before he won the presidential race.",
      "Since then, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases, which pertained to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. A separate state election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold. Trump denies wrongdoing in all.",
      "Other Gallup findings have shown that Democrats\u2019 confidence in the Supreme Court dropped by 25 points between 2021 and 2022, the year the justices overturned constitutional protections for abortion. Their trust climbed a bit, to 34%, in 2023, but dropped again to 24% in 2024. The change comes after a Supreme Court opinion that Trump and other former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.",
      "Trust in the court among Republicans, by contrast, reached 71% in 2024.",
      "The judicial system more broadly also lost public confidence more quickly than many other U.S. institutions over the last four years. Confidence in the federal government, for example, also declined to 26%. That was a 20-point drop \u2014 not as steep as the decline in confidence in the courts.",
      "The trust drop is also steep compared with other countries around the world. Only a handful of other countries have seen larger drops during a four-year period. They include a 46-point drop in Myanmar during the period that overlapped the return of military rule in 2021, a 35-point drop in Venezuela amid deep economic and political turmoil from 2012 to 2016 and a 28-point drop in Syria in the runup and early years of its civil war.",
      "The survey was based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 U.S. adults between June 28 and August 1."

      "Crime writer John D",
      "NEW YORK -- Crime writer John D. MacDonald, a master of the genre, was so prolific that sometimes even he couldn't keep up with what he was doing.",
      "He might have dozens of stories in submission at once and would leave some unfinished or unpublished as he moved on to a new idea. One of the surviving manuscripts was recently discovered and appears this week in the literary quarterly The Strand Magazine, which has run rarities by Ernest Hemingway,Tennessee Williams and many others. \"The Accomplice\u201d is an early work from the author known for his Travis McGee series and for the novel \u201cThe Executioners,\u201d retitled \u201cCape Fear\u201d in two film adaptations.",
      "The newly seen story, a narrative of lust, betrayal and dangerous choices, was found in the archives at the University of Florida.",
      "\u201cRaw and gritty, the narrative embraces classic noir tropes, only to flip them in quintessential MacDonald style with an unexpected and thought-provoking finale,\u201d Strand managing editor Andrew F. Gulli writes in the current issue.",
      "\u201cThe Accomplice\u201d is set in a grocery store where a \u201cnearly\u201d 18-year clerk named Joey works alongside the middle-aged owner, John Mallon, and his younger wife, Belle, whom MacDonald introduces as tall and long-faced, very white and so thin and taut that \u201cher hips stuck out against the dresses she wore.\u201d Before long, she is paying close attention to Joey, who would prefer \u2014 at first \u2014 that she keep it all professional.",
      "\u201cIt scared him a little when he realized that when they were alone, in the store he\u2019d head for the space behind the meat counter or the entrance to the cellar where the stock was kept, knowing that she would find some excuse to go by him,\u201d MacDonald writes.",
      "\u201cAfter he realized that, he had a hard time getting to sleep at night and sometimes he would dream about her. In the dreams she was cold to touch, and like snakes. And then she would get mixed up in the dream with other girls.\u201d",
      "In a plot turn known to fans of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and other noir favorites, Belle proposes that they kill her husband and use the insurance money to go into business together.",
      "\"She whispered, \u2018How are we going to do it, Joey?\u2019\u201d",
      "MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, in 1916, and later moved with his family to Utica, New York, where he was still living when he wrote \u201cThe Accomplice.\u201d He settled in Sarasota, Florida in the early 1950s and remained for decades before dying in Milwaukee, in 1986. His books have sold millions of copies and numerous authors, including Stephen King, have cited him as an influence. He is especially loved in Florida, and was honored in song by another famous state resident, Jimmy Buffett, who offered tribute in \u201cIncommunicado.\u201d",
      "According to MacDonald scholar Calvin Branche, the author likely wrote \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d in the late 1940s-early 1950s and set it aside amidst other projects. His wife, Dorothy, had gotten one of his stories published while he was serving overseas in World War II, and he was anxious to follow up, writing some 80 hours a week. MacDonald was still a few years away from his Travis McGee books, but Branche said that \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d did anticipate the moral struggles of McGee and other MacDonald protagonists.",
      "\u201c(Joey) stands up to her temptation despite having initially thought her plan and a future with her might be good,\u201d Branche says. \u201cThe reader is pleased with this conclusion, and it is the kind of insight characters find in many of the stories.\u201d"

      "On the same day, Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch was removed from office by legislators by the Navajo Nation Council, in a 13-6 vote without public discussion.",
      "The tribe has been mired in political upheaval since April, when Navajo Vice President Richelle Montoya publicly outlined allegations of intimidation and sexual harassment against President Buu Nygren, stemming from interactions at an August 2023 meeting in Nygren's office.",
      "Results of an investigation by outside counsel into the harassment allegations were announced Monday morning in a news release by Branch.",
      "The probe found that the \u201cincident does not constitute sexual harassment under policies applicable to either Navajo Nation elected officials or employees,\u201d and that further investigation was not warranted.",
      "\u201cThe facts reported would not constitute a violation of any criminal law of the Navajo Nation,\u201d an excerpt of the findings said.",

      "Branch, a Harvard-educated attorney who served a previous stint as attorney general under Navajo President Russell Begaye, recently worked on a proposed settlement that would ensure water rights for the Navajo Nation and two others tribes in the drought-stricken Southwest and regulations aimed at safe transportation of radioactive materials across the reservation.",
      "Navajo Vice President Michelle Montoya said she is eager to read the full investigative report once it\u2019s released publicly, and that she\u2019s heard from an \u201cavalanche\u201d of people who have endured harassing behavior in tribal government workplace settings.",
      "\u201cThen I\u2019ll know what definition they utilized to say that I wasn\u2019t sexually harassed,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cI do know that the Council and the people of the Navajo Nation have been frustrated with this investigation.\u201d",
      "Branch said she was \u201csatisfied that no rock was left unturned in the search for evidence of any potential wrongdoing\" in the harassment investigation by outside counsel.",
      "\u201cI do not believe it is in the best interest of the (Navajo) Nation to continue spending the Nation\u2019s money on allegations that, even if taken as true, would not amount to any violation of Navajo law,\u201d Branch said. \u201cI encourage any Navajo employee who feels they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report it.\"",
      "But Branch also announced the termination of contracts with the law firm for outside counsel in the harassment probe, expressing frustration at an \u201cinordinate delay\u201d in completion of the investigation that \u201cexacerbated the instability in Navajo government that the allegations induced.\""

      "NEW YORK -- A judge Monday refused to throw out President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hush money conviction because of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity. But the overall future of the historic case remains unclear.",
      "Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan's decision blocks one potential off-ramp from the case ahead of the former and future president's return to office next month. His lawyers have raised other arguments for dismissal, however. It's unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 a sentencing date might be set.",
      "Prosecutors have said there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insist the conviction should stand.",
      "A jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump denies wrongdoing.",
      "The allegations involved a scheme to hide the payout to Daniels during the final days of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign to keep her from publicizing \u2014 and keep voters from hearing \u2014 her claim of a sexual encounter with the married then-businessman years earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them.",
      "A month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can\u2019t be prosecuted for official acts \u2014 things they did in the course of running the country \u2014 and that prosecutors can\u2019t cite those actions to bolster a case centered on purely personal, unofficial conduct.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers then cited the Supreme Court opinion to argue that the hush money jury got some improper evidence, such as Trump\u2019s presidential financial disclosure form, testimony from some White House aides and social media posts made while he was in office.",
      "In Monday\u2019s ruling, Merchan denied the bulk of Trump\u2019s claims that some of prosecutors\u2019 evidence related to official acts and implicated immunity protections.",
      "The judge said that even if he found that some evidence related to official conduct, he\u2019d still conclude that prosecutors\u2019 decision to use \u201cthese acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\u201d",
      "Even if prosecutors had erroneously introduced evidence that could be challenged under an immunity claim, Merchan continued, \u201csuch error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors had said the evidence in question was only \u201ca sliver\u201d of their case.",
      "Trump communications director Steven Cheung on Monday called Merchan\u2019s decision a \u201cdirect violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.",
      "Merchan's decision noted that part of the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling declared that \u201cnot everything the president does is official.\u201d Trump's social media posts, for example, were personal, Merchan wrote.",
      "He also pointed to a prior federal court ruling that concluded that the hush money payment and subsequent reimbursements pertained to Trump\u2019s private life, not official duties.",
      "Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20. He's the first former president to be convicted of a felony and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office.",
      "Over the last six months, his lawyers have made numerous efforts to get the conviction and the overall case dismissed. After Trump won last month's election, Merchan indefinitely postponed his sentencing \u2014 which had been scheduled for late November \u2014 so defense lawyers and prosecutors could suggest next steps.",
      "Trump's defense argued that anything other than immediate dismissal would undermine the transfer of power and cause unconstitutional \u201cdisruptions\" to the presidency.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors proposed several ways to preserve the historic conviction. Among the suggestions: freezing the case until Trump leaves office in 2029; agreeing that any future sentence won\u2019t include jail time; or closing the case by noting he was convicted but that he wasn\u2019t sentenced and his appeal wasn\u2019t resolved because he took office.",
      "The last idea is drawn from what some states do when a defendant dies after conviction but before sentencing.",
      "Trump's lawyers branded the concept \u201cabsurd\u201d and took issue with the other suggestions, too.",
      "Trump was indicted four times last year. The hush money case was the only one to go to trial.",
      "After the election, special counsel Jack Smith ended his two federal cases. They pertained to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "A separate state election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold.",
      "Trump denies wrongdoing in all."

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory.",
      "Trump called the decision made by Biden last month \u201cstupid.\" He also expressed anger that his incoming administration was not consulted before Biden made the move. With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that should have been allowed, not when there\u2019s a possibility \u2014 certainly not just weeks before I take over,\" Trump said during at a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \"Why would they do that without asking me what I thought? I wouldn\u2019t have had him do that. I think it was a big mistake.\u201d",
      "Trump's withering criticism of the Biden administration's move comes as the Democratic administration aims to push every last dollar already designated for Ukraine out the door to help repel Russia's invasion before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, with future aid uncertain.",
      "But even as Biden tries to surge weaponry and other aid to Ukraine in his final five weeks in office, the moment underscored that it's Trump who holds the most significant influence over how Ukraine can use its U.S.-provided arsenal in the long run. It\u2019s a critical piece of leverage he could use to try to follow through on his campaign pledge to bring about a swift end to the conflict.",
      "Asked if he would consider reversing the Biden administration decision, Trump responded: \u201cI might. I think it was a very stupid thing to do.\u201d",
      "The White House pushed back on Trump\u2019s criticism, noting that the decision was made after months of deliberations that started before last month\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cAll I can assure you is that in the conversations we\u2019ve had with them since the election, and we\u2019ve had at various levels, we have articulated to them the logic behind it, the thinking behind it, why we were doing it,\u201d White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the current administration's coordination with the outgoing administration.",
      "Trump's relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance has said that while the U.S. has differences with Russia, it was counterproductive to approach Moscow as an enemy.",
      "Trump on Monday reiterated his call on both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war, calling the death and despair caused by the conflict \u201ccarnage.\u201d",
      "But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that finding an immediate endgame to the war \u2014 something he has previously said he could get done within 24 hours of taking office \u2014 could be difficult.",
      "\u201cI think the Middle East will be in a good place,\" Trump said, referring to the conflict in Gaza and an unsettled Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. \u201cI think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation.\u201d",
      "Trump declined to say whether he has spoken with Putin since the election.",
      "Zelenskyy met with Trump in Paris earlier this month, while the president-elect was visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have been making a forceful effort to get Trump to maintain support for Ukraine.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Ukraine continues to remain complicated as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly three-year war.",
      "The Pentagon last week unveiled U.S. intelligence that predicts Russia could again launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine soon.",
      "Putin deployed the missile for the first time last month days after Biden loosened the restrictions on Ukraine. Putin warned the West that Russia's next use could be against Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia.",
      "Biden agreed to loosen the restrictions after Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters had pressed Biden for months. They argued that the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.",
      "The outgoing president ultimately made the decision last month amid concerns about Russia deploying thousands of North Korean troops to help it claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year."

    "story": [
      "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- An attorney defending Jay-Z against the rape allegation brought against him last week by an unnamed woman outlined a range of evidence Monday that he said showed the accuser\u2019s account to be \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "The woman told NBC News last week that Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sexually assaulted her in 2000, when she was 13, at an after-party for the MTV Music Awards. She has since acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have a flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a more high-pitched buzzing noise than what's generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multi-copter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",

      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",

      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",

      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",

      "BOSTON -- Two men, including a dual Iranian American citizen, have been charged with conspiring to export sensitive technology to Iran that was used in a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops early this year and injured dozens of other service members, the Justice Department said Monday.",
      "The pair were arrested after FBI specialists who analyzed the drone traced its navigation system to an Iranian company operated by one of the defendants, who relied on parts and technology funneled into the country by his alleged co-conspirator, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cWe often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technology getting into dangerous hands,\u201d U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, said at a news conference announcing the charges. \u201cUnfortunately, in this situation, we are not speculating.\u201d",
      "The defendants were identified as Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, who prosecutors say works at a Massachusetts-based semiconductor company, and Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, who was arrested Monday in Italy as the Justice Department seeks his extradition to Massachusetts.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Abedininajafabadi, who was also called Adedini in court documents, has deep connections to the Iranian government. They say his Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and that he conspired with Sadeghi to circumvent American export control laws, including through the creation of a front company in Switzerland, and procure sensitive technology into Iran.",
      "Sadeghi, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested Monday in Massachusetts and was ordered to remain detained following a court appearance. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Both men are charged with export control violations, and Abedini separately faces charges of conspiring to provide material support to Iran.",
      "Three Georgia soldiers \u2014 Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt. Breonna Moffett of Savannah and Sgt. Kennedy Sanders of Waycross \u2014 were killed in the Jan. 28 drone attack on a U.S. outpost in northeastern Jordan called Tower 22. U.S. officials have blamed it on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes Kataib Hezbollah.",
      "In the attack, the one-way attack drone may have been mistaken for a U.S. drone that was expected to return back to the logistics base about the same time and was not shot down. Instead, it crashed into living quarters, killing the three soldiers and injuring more than 40.",
      "\u201cTo the people who were injured by this attack, to the loved ones and family members of the people who lost their lives, as the son of a combat veteran I humbly hope that today\u2019s charges bring some measure of justice and accountability,\u201d Levy said.",
      "Tower 22 held about 350 U.S. military personnel at the time. It is strategically located between Jordan and Syria, only 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Iraqi border, and in the months just after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel\u2019s blistering response in Gaza, Iranian-backed militias intensified their attacks on U.S. military locations in the region.",
      "Following the attack, the U.S. launched a huge counterstrike against 85 sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iranian-backed militia and bolstered Tower 22\u2019s defenses.",

      "Regular pay grew at a faster-than-expected annual pace of 5.2% between August and October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with wages continuing to grow faster than prices.",

      "The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.3%, although there are questions over the reliability of the jobs figures from the ONS due to problems with gathering the data.",
      "\"After slowing steadily for over a year, growth in pay excluding bonuses increased slightly in the latest period driven by stronger growth in private sector pay,\" said Liz McKeown, director of statistics at the ONS.",
      "Private sector pay grew at an annual pace of 5.4%, the ONS said, while in the public sector it was 4.3%.",
      "The Bank of England watches the pay and jobs data closely when making decisions on interest rates.",

      "The Bank meets to discuss rates again this week, but it is not expected to make a further cut given the strength in pay growth.",
      "\"The latest UK jobs report provides yet more justification, if any were needed, for the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at its meeting this week,\" said James Smith, developed markets economist at ING.",
      "Mr Smith noted that the jump in wage growth was entirely down to the private sector.",
      "\"This matters for the Bank, because private sector pay trends tend to be more reflective of the wider situation in the jobs market than in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Monica George Michail, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: \"With low inflation, workers have been making real income gains.",
      "\"However, given the slowdown in recruitment activity and rising unemployment, we expect wage growth to slow in the coming months, although the rise in National Living Wage in April would exert some upward pressure.\"",
      "The number of job vacancies fell by 31,000 to 818,000 in the September-to-November period, the ONS said, although the total remains above pre-pandemic figures.",

      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",

      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",

      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",

      "EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday.",
      "The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes - \"for as long as I am alive\".",
      "The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to \u00a3300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\".",
      "The regulator said in September that it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.",
      "Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at \u00a35.3bn.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover \"will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers\".",
      "Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.",
      "He added, that EP Group had a \"mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers\".",
      "The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.",
      "Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an \"extensive agreement\" and the deal was the \"best opportunity\" to save the future of Royal Mail.",

      "Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure.",
      "But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago.",

      "The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.",

    "summary": "Masayoshi Son said he would invest $100bn in the US, and others could follow during Trump's second term.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump pitching the US as a great place for business,  firms around the world are figuring out how to answer his call.",
      "Japanese tech billionaire Masayoshi Son, a colourful character known as much for his major flops as his big accomplishments, presented one path on Monday, appearing with Trump at a press conference and pledging to invest $100bn (\u00a379bn) over four years and create 100,000 jobs.",
      "\"He's a great negotiator,\" the CEO said, laughing on stage as Trump pressed him to double his commitment.",
      "But plenty of questions remain about Mr Son's venture, especially in light of the lack of details he provided and the record of similar investments during Trump's first term.",
      "Mr Son has previously discussed the opportunity he sees in artificial intelligence, and Bloomberg reported in February that he was planning a $100bn chip venture.",
      "But his Softbank Group had only about a third of that, $30bn, in cash earlier this year and its global reputation has taken large hits after previous bets, such as a major investment in co-working firm WeWork, imploded.",
      "With the cameras rolling at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Son avoided giving specifics about how he would fund his promise.",
      "Nor did Trump demand details, casting the pledge primarily as a sign of a wider renewal in business optimism, which has been reported in surveys in recent weeks.",
      "\"This historic investment is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America's future,\" the president-elect said.",
      "Trump has indicated that when he returns to the White House he plans to use the bully pulpit to court foreign investment.",
      "His campaign promises to slash both taxes and regulations have already boosted Wall Street and charged up big business to pursue large-scale ambitions.",
      "Specifically, Trump has said he would cut taxes for companies that make products in the US and speed approvals for firms investing $1bn or more.",
      "Investors expect him to green-light takeovers and pull back on enforcing antitrust laws, as well.",
      "Still, there are concerns about Trump's campaign promises to crack down on immigration, which could affect the workforce, and raise tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. On top of that, he has discussed rolling back manufacturing and energy incentives put in place by President Joe Biden, which some investors like.",
      "Political leaders from both parties often promote business investments and will often take some credit when those ventures boom. President Joe Biden, for example, visited projects by companies such as chipmaker TSMC to highlight historic incentives the government approved for green energy and high-tech firms.",
      "Monday's event recalled pageantry familiar from Trump's first term in office, which was punctuated by high-profile announcements of investments. Many of those planned projects had been in the works already or were hazy in their chances of becoming reality.",
      "Those included Taiwanese semiconductor giant Foxconn's plans to build up a technology park in Wisconsin, which Trump had boasted would become the \"eighth wonder of the world\". Instead of creating more than 13,000 jobs and spending more than $10bn, the company created less than 1,000 jobs and spent around $1bn, according to CNBC.",
      "Trump had also said he would save a failed car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, with an electric vehicle start-up backed by Foxconn and had celebrated promises to create a million jobs over five years made by Alibaba's Jack Ma.",
      "The car company - Lordstown Motors - filed for bankruptcy and reorganized to become Nu Ride Inc earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, Alibaba has said it \"supported\" 403,000 US jobs in 2022, five years after Mr Ma made his promise.",
      "Mr Son's relationship with Trump also dates back to his first election.",
      "Shortly after Trump took the White House, the two men appeared together to discuss $50bn Mr Son planned to invest in the US, as his firm was evolving into a kind of technology venture-capital firm.",
      "Its current holdings include US telecom firm T-Mobile and UK microchip designer Arm."

      "BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop.",
      "We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi.",
      "Our snapshot from one day, which does not take into account loyalty card prices, suggests Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of Christmas essentials, at around \u00a324.30.",

      "Tesco was most expensive at \u00a336.51. Last year, our research suggested Morrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third.",

      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",

      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",

      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",

      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",

    "summary": "Thanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.",
    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:08:26 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has told the BBC that the introduction of a \"landmark\" children's bill \"will seek to keep children safe\".",
      "The bill will be put forward on the same day as Sara Sharif's father and step-mother are due to be sentenced for her murder.",
      "The 10-year-old victim was removed from primary school in order to be home-educated four months before she died.",
      "A register which identifies children in England who are not currently attending school will form part of the bill, as well as increased powers for councils.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will make sure that teachers and schools are always involved in decisions around safeguarding children in their area, and that if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe, local authorities have the power to intervene.",
      "A unique identifier number will be given to children across services, similar to an adult's national insurance number.",
      "'Work together'",
      "Phillipson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government wanted \"everyone pulling together to keep children safe\".",
      "The unique identifier would enable information held by different services, such as health and education, to be shared between them - to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks, the education secretary said.",
      "\"It's about police, schools, children's social care.\"",
      "\"The measures today will require those agencies to work together much more effectively to keep children safe.\"",
      "Under the government's plans, parents will no longer have an automatic right to educate their children at home if their child is under a child protection plan, and will have to acquire the local council's permission first.",
      "The previous government had also proposed creating a register of children who are not in school.",
      "But the Children's Charities Coalition, representing Action for Children, Barnardo's, the National Children's Bureau, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and The Children's Society, said: \"The money announced today falls far short of what's needed.",
      "\"Children and families desperately need - and deserve - sustained investment in early help services, mental-health support and children's social care.",
      "\"This needs to be underpinned by an ambitious strategy to tackle child poverty.\"",
      "'Attendance challenges'",
      "The number of children being home-educated in England has risen by 20% this year, according to the most recent government figures.",
      "The Department for Education says knowledge of where children are will enable councils to ensure a high-quality education is being provided, and to deliver the necessary support.",
      "The Local Government Association, which represents councils, has asked for the new register to come with additional powers.",
      "\"[The register] must be combined with powers for councils to meet face-to-face with children, which is vital to allow councils to ensure children are receiving a suitable education in a safe environment,\" said councillor Arooj Shah, chair of the Children and Young People Board.",
      "But not everyone agrees with plans for a register.",
      "\"International research is clear that introducing registers for home-educated children makes no positive difference whatsoever to those children's outcomes, and leads to fewer being known to public bodies,\" Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, told the BBC.",
      "\"Promises of support have been made for about fifteen years now and have yet to materialise.",
      "\"Over 100,000 children are already registered with local authorities as home-educated, new legislation is not needed to offer those families requested support,\" she added.",
      "There have been several attempts to introduce a register over the last decade by successive governments, but all have failed.",
      "Phillipson told the BBC's Breakfast programme she was worried about the \"big increase\" in home-schooling.",
      "\"I respect the rights of parents to seek to home-educate their children,\" she said.",
      "\"My concern is that some parents are choosing to opt out of the system because they feel their children's needs are not being met.",
      "\"We face some really big and stark attendance challenges.\"",
      "The Education Policy Institute warned that up to 300,000 children may be missing from education entirely.",
      "Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said she had \"called on successive governments to introduce a unique identifying number for children and a register of all children not in school\".",
      "\"Writing these two landmark measures into law will be of huge significance for any child currently at risk of harm in this country.",
      "\"It must now be supported by proper data-sharing between organisations so no child can become invisible in the system.\"",

      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

      "Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.",
      "\"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says.",
      "He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.",
      "\"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\"",
      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",
      "\"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.",
      "\"Best musical monkey!\" he beams.",

      "At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list.",
      "Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.",
      "Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.",
      "Also in this year's mix are Brenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation of Band Aid.",

      "Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young.",
      "There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.",
      "And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.",
      "\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says.",
      "\"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.",
      "\"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\"",
      "Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.",
      "\"The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,\" Talbot notes.",
      "That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "\"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.",
      "\"Streaming doesn't really work.\" Instead, he says: \"It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.\"",

      "In recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019.",
      "This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.",
      "Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a \"no-brainer\" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.",

      "\"It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,\" he says of the LadBaby era.",
      "\"Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.\"",
      "Last Christmas \"won by default\", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing \"the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order\".",
      "'Disaster for the concept'",
      "Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.",
      "Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.",
      "But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to \"achieve enough momentum\" to \"get lucky\".",
      "\"My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,\" he concludes.",
      "So anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the late Liam Payne, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey or Yorkshire Pudding Boy - will probably require a cracking campaign.",
      "There have been upsets in the past - fans of Rage Against the Machine's Killing in the Name put a small-but-welcome dint in the X Factor monopoly in 2009.",
      "Talbot thinks that if Sheeran really \"wanted to really go for it\" with Under The Tree, his song from Richard Curtis's That Christmas movie, he could challenge Wham! and  Mariah.",
      "Alternatively, the \"Wicked phenomenon could be really powerful\", meaning Cynthia Ervivo and Grande's Defying Gravity could pull off a \"surprise\" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema.",
      "US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter has released a Christmas-centric EP, Fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown.",
      "So it's beginning to look a lot like Wham! will be Christmas number one again - just like last Christmas.",

      "Jay-Z's attorney, Alex Spiro, asked the court to dismiss Jane Doe's case, saying in a statement to the BBC: \"It is stunning that a lawyer would not only file such a serious complaint without proper vetting, but would make things worse by further peddling this false story in the press.\"",

Experts have told us failing to question these disproven claims is dangerous because it creates a distrust of conventional medicine.",

      "\"It is really urgent,\" Youth Music CEO Matt Griffiths tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "The charity's announced it's teaming up with streaming giant Spotify to fund 15 youth clubs over the next year to provide more opportunities and support to pursue music.",
      "\"We have a real opportunity not just to fund but to story tell,\" says Spotify's global head of social impact, Lauren Wurgraft.",
      "Spotify has drawn criticism from artists over how much they get paid by the platform, and Youth Music says it had to consider that carefully when agreeing to the deal.",
      "But it's been welcomed by south London rapper Still Shadey who tells Newsbeat music was a \"saving grace\" and a spark \"for something positive\" when he was growing up.",
      "The MOBO award winner launched his own scheme to support young people in his area over the summer with funding from Arts Council England, Mirror Mirror.",
      "\"We have huge brands taking a step that will hopefully create a catalyst where other organisations can do the same,\" he says.",
      "Spotify would not tell Newsbeat how much it's spending on the project with Youth Music but Matt says it's \"over six figures\".",
      "The money will be used to protect youth clubs across the UK that are at risk of closure in a bid to get more young people into music.",
      "It follows Youth Music's Sound of the Next Generation report, a survey the charity does every five years, with its latest one asking 2,100 young people about their lives and attitudes towards music.",
      "\"Top of the tree as their favourite thing in their lives is music,\" says Matt.",
      "\"But there was also a contrasting [finding] about access to music getting more limited, particularly access to making music and creating and composing your own music.\"",
      "Girls and people from the North of England are particularly affected according to the report which highlights the cost of music education as a major block.",
      "Meanwhile, research from the YMCA suggests that since 2011, about half of England's youth clubs have closed - rising to 60% in Wales.",
      "The Local Government Association adds that, in that same time, government funding for youth clubs has declined by 73% in real terms.",
      "Shadey says it was \"the last phase of youth clubs\" when he was growing up, describing the centres as little more than a warm space.",
      "\"We felt this was ending, things were closing down, derelict buildings, old PlayStation games, nothing being updated.",
      "\"That's not enough to keep a young person engaged. They want to learn and grow and be a part of something.\"",
      "Lauren agrees that access is a \"huge barrier\".",
      "\"You can dream about being an artist but if you don't actually have a place where you can go and create and learn, then that really is never going to become a reality.\"",
      "The 15 youth hubs which will be receiving the money haven't yet been decided - although according to Matt the funding could be allocated as soon as Christmas.",
      "Youth Music says it will be targeting programmes and centres across the UK it already works with.",
      "\"It's very important these aren't just based in major cities because we know these spaces are important to youth all over the place,\" says Lauren.",
      "For Shadey, he hopes projects like this will help with what he sees as the biggest problem facing young people: feeling \"disconnected\" from the areas where they live.",
      "\"Feeling like they don't belong,\" he says.",
      "Spotify and monetising music",
      "Youth Music's stated mission isn't just to help marginalised young people make music, it's also to help them monetise it.",
      "And Spotify has a reputation - it says an unfair one - for not being very profitable for artists.",
      "The platform pays royalties to copyright holders and while sometimes that's the artist, it often means publishers and labels.",
      "Last year, 1,000 British artists were streamed enough to be paid at least \u00a3100,000 but on average they would only pocket 16% of what they earn from the app, all while Spotify reports record breaking billion dollar profits.",
      "Spotify says rights holders take around 70% of revenue, and UK recording artists made \u00a3750 million in royalties from streaming last year, with the streamer having no say in how the money's split - that's an agreement between the artists and their management.",
      "Copyright holders are also not paid at all if their song is streamed fewer than 1,000 times in a year.",
      "Matt says squaring that with Youth Music's ethos of helping artists monetise their work was something the charity had to \"think about\".",
      "\"The debate about how artists, particularly emerging artists, make a living is very, very live,\" he says.",
      "\"You make a judgement call that in the end, this is going to make a difference for young people and their lives in music at this urgent time.\"",
      "Lauren acknowledges this scheme is more targeted at opening that initial door for artists of the future than sustaining a career in the industry.",
      "\"To basically provide opportunities for them to learn and grow and connect and be nurtured so they can actually even imagine becoming an artist and making a livelihood off it,\" she says.",
      "Spotify isn't the only private company that's announced schemes aimed at filling the gap in youth services this year.",
      "Working with BBC Children in Need and fronted by rapper AJ Tracey, McDonald's launched its Makin' It project, partnering restaurants with youth workers so they can host workshops and drop-in sessions.",
      "And in south London, Stormzy set up a youth club in partnership with Adidas earlier this year, something Lauren says inspired Spotify.",
      "\"It's great these bigger companies are coming in and investing in those communities as part of their corporate social responsibility,\" says Shadey.",
      "\"But the depth is only gonna be seen if they partner with community leaders and grassroots organisations so it's authentic.\"",
      "Stormzy's Merky FC is a state-of-the-art facility with a full-size football pitch, recording studio and gaming centre and the rapper told the BBC he'd be a regular visitor, providing songwriting masterclasses and gaming.",
      "Spotify on the other hand will be taking a more hands-off approach and won't be involved in the Youth Music scheme beyond the funding they've pledged.",
      "But Shadey thinks the power of brand alone will draw people in.",
      "His Mirror Mirror project supported 60 young people - all of whom had to apply - and provided trips to 1Xtra and Abbey Road studios and the Houses of Parliament to give them a taste of the music industry.",
      "\"I think youth clubs today need to create that same model where people know it's a privilege, they know it's an opportunity.\"",
      "While this project has some government support, Matt says the charity would prefer not to rely so much on private investment.",
      "\"Short term funding, it's great at the time but you're always planning for the next days without getting that longer term certainty,\" he says.",

      "\"They were like, 'But we can't spend 24 hours with you. So get real and get a life.' So they gently nudged me back into the films,\" he says.",

      "Alia Bhatt: The young Bollywood star taking on Hollywood",
      "At 59, Khan has worked as an actor, director and producer for three decades.",
      "He's known as one of the three \"Khans of Bollywood\" - the others being fellow megastars Shah Rukh and Salman.",
      "Known for tackling social issues, Aamir's films are widely acclaimed as well as breaking box office records.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.",
      "Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.",
      "Khan said he's \"not quite sure how seriously\" to take awards. \"Cinema is so subjective,\" he says.",
      "But he admits a win would mean a lot to India.",
      "\"I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,\" he says.",
      "\"So just for the people of our country and for our country, I would be really happy if we win the award.\"",
      "Set in rural India, Laapataa Ladies tells the story of a young man bringing the wrong bride home. Meanwhile, his wife ends up lost, having to fend for herself.",
      "It's a satire looking at the treatment of women, including touching on the sensitive topic of domestic violence.",
      "Khan describes the plot as \"a bit Shakespearean\", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.",
      "But, he adds, it's saying \"a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do\".",
      "It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.",
      "\"Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,\" he says.",
      "\"Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it.\"",
      "Khan was also \"very keen\" that his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, should direct the film.",
      "The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.",
      "\"I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,\" he says.",
      "\"We get along really well. We really love each other, we respect each other.",
      "\"Our relationship may have changed slightly \u2013 but that doesn't mean what we feel for each other has gone down or something.\"",
      "That's not to say it's all been plain sailing, however.",
      "Khan admits there were arguments on set.",
      "\"We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,\" he says.",
      "\"But our sensibilities are very similar. We are not talking about fundamental things. We are just trying to sometimes convince the other person a better way of conveying something.\"",
      "Bollywood on the global stage",
      "Bollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.",
      "The sway the films and stars have on their fans' imagination cannot be overstated.",
      "It has had recent success at the Academy Awards, with Naatu Naatu from RRR winning best original song and The Elephant Whisperers awarded best documentary short film.",
      "But victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something Khan attributes to the competition.",
      "\"India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,\" he says.",
      "\"But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.\"",
      "As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is \"possible\".",
      "But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.",
      "\"I've never really looked at an international audience,\" he says. \"We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.",
      "\"That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now.\"",
      "'I don't work after 6 o'clock'",
      "For now, Khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside Laapataa Ladies, which also include his next film Sitaare Zameen Par, due for release in 2025.",
      "Looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his \"dream project\" is to take on Mahabharat - the ancient Indian epic.",
      "But since unretiring from film, he is determined to do things differently. Again, this was influenced by his children.",
      "\"My son said, 'You're an extreme person',\" he says.",
      "\"He said, 'You're like a pendulum. You only did films, films, films. And now you want to swing to the other side and do no films and be with family, family, family. There is a middle place also you can think about'.\"",
      "Khan says his son told him to \"try and bring some balance\" into his life.",
      "\"And I thought he was right. So since then, that's what I've been trying to do - living a balanced life where I'm working really hard, in fact I'm doing much more work that I ever did, but I don't work after 6 o'clock any more.\"",
      "Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.",
      "\"I think that's something that's really helped me. That's really helped me understand myself better.",
      "\"I'm actually finding that balance between work and a personal life. So I feel that I've reached that space now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",
      "He worked with banjo maestro B\u00e9la Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

    "story": [
      "2023 was supposed to be Flo's year.",
      "A few months before the calendar flipped over, the London-based girl band made a huge splash with their debut single, Cardboard Box, a sassy kiss-off to a cheating ex that drew on the girl group sounds of En Vogue, SWV and Destiny's Child.",
      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",
      "\"Maybe, for the next tour, we should just get mechanical bulls instead of treadmills.\"",

    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

    "summary": "The actor plays Dylan in A Complete Unknown, which focuses on the singer's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",

    "summary": "The OEP has ruled that it allowed excessive sewage into England's rivers and seas.",
    "story": [
      "The government and regulators have broken the law by being too lenient on water companies that spill sewage, the UK's environment watchdog has found.",
      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",
      "It acknowledged that regulator Ofwat had now taken steps to change the way it implemented the law. The government and the Environment Agency are carefully \"considering the allegations\" but failure to accept them could result in legal action.",
      "Campaigners welcomed the findings but called it a \"bittersweet moment\".",
      "Public anger has increased in recent years over the level of sewage spills which were found to have doubled in 2023.",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "Protesters call on government to tackle water pollution",
      "More officers to probe sewage - Environment Agency",
      "\"The OEP's findings offer yet another devastating verdict of the total failure of environmental regulation in our country,\" said chair and founder of River Action Charles Watson. \"It is nothing short of scandalous.\"",
      "Sewage sometimes needs to be released when it is raining to prevent a build-up of wastewater in the system and sewage flowing back into people's homes.",
      "But two years ago the wildlife charity WildFish complained to the OEP that the Conservative government, and the regulators - Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) - were allowing excessive releases. It argued that according to the law sewage should only be released under \"exceptional circumstances\", such as unusually heavy rain, rather than any wet weather.",
      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",
      "And the less rainfall there is to dilute the sewage the more harmful it could potentially be.",
      "Nick Measham, CEO at WildFish, told the BBC following the announcement: \"We are absolutely delighted and relieved. It actually means we can end this problem of sewage going into rivers.",
      "\"But it is a bittersweet moment. It's frustrating when the government and the regulators don't actually do their job in the way you'd hope.\"",
      "The OEP was set up under the 2021 Environment Act to hold the government and other public bodies to account in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "It has acknowledged that Ofwat has now taken steps to change the way it implements the law, and in August Ofwat announced record fines for three water companies.",
      "But the government's environment department, Defra, and the Environment Agency are currently consulting on any changes, and have said they would \"carefully consider\" the OEP's allegations.",
      "A Defra spokesperson said: \"For too long, water companies have pumped record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. In just five months, this government has acted decisively to refresh outdated guidance to make extremely clear our expectations around storm overflows.\"",
      "On Tuesday Defra also announced that water companies would have to increase compensation for customers facing service failures such as water outages or pollution.",
      "Customers would receive automatic payments of up to \u00a32,000 for water supply outages, sewer flooding or low water pressure.",
      "The announcement follows a public consultation in August.",
      "If Defra and the EA decide to accept the finding in full - which they must do by March - it could result in changes to thousands of environmental permits.",
      "There would also be a question as to whether water companies' new five-year investment plans - which are due to be announced on Thursday - would be sufficient to upgrade infrastructure to meet these requirements.",
      "A spokesperson for WaterUK, the industry body, told the BBC: \"While regulators argue among themselves about what they think the rules are, water companies plan to deliver the world's biggest ever programme to end sewage entering rivers.",
      "\"We await Ofwat's decision on Thursday and hope they give us the green light so we can get on with it.\"",

      "Neither Ms Lee nor Mr Yang are facing prosecution over the separate allegations made against them and both have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Ms Lee, a solicitor, had said that her involvement with Parliament had been to \"represent the UK Chinese and increase diversity\".",
      "But the MI5 alert to parliamentarians said that she was \"knowingly engaged in political interference and activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\".",
      "The UFWD is an arm of the CCP's intelligence network that seeks to wider influence and poverty interfere in British society by targeting leading figures in British society, from politicians through to business and academia.",
      "Ms Lee's alleged work for the UFWD included facilitating financial donations to political parties, parliamentarians and aspiring MPs - donations that had come from sources in China and Hong Kong.",
      "One of the MPs funded by Ms Lee was Labour's Barry Gardiner, who received more than \u00a3420,000 from her in five years.",
      "He employed Ms Lee's son, Daniel Wilkes, until the alert emerged.",
      "Mr Gardiner has said that he had always made the security services aware of the donations.",
      "After the alert was issued, Mr Gardiner sacked Mr Wilkes from his office staff. The pair later reached an out-of-court settlement.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also received a \u00a35,000 donation when he was energy secretary - but he said the money had been accepted by his local association and the alert had been \"the first time\" had had been made aware of concerns.",
      "In Tuesday's judgment, the IPT rejected claims from Ms Lee and Mr Wilkes that their rights had been breached by MI5.",
      "Lord Justice Singh and two other IPT panel members said that the interference in Ms Lee's private life, by publicising her name, did not breach her human rights.",
      "\"There is no ... positive obligations on the state to take action to prevent treatment by others, here in particular the media and private individuals who sent abusive messages to the First Claimant [Ms Lee],\" said the IPT.",

      "\"The Respondent was entitled to issue the Interference Alert, and indeed had an obligation to do in order to fulfil its statutory function of protecting Parliamentary democracy.",
      "\"There is no evidence that the abusive messages and social media commentary directed to or received by [Ms Lee] represented a genuine and ongoing threat to her safety and, even if they did, there is no evidence that the police or other state authorities are unable or unwilling to provide [her] with reasonable protection.",

      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",

      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",

      "More than 20,000 people have made the crossing to the UK since Labour took power, up on 17,020 during the same period last year.",
      "During a visit to Rome, Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show there had been a \"bad history\" of home secretaries giving pledges on migration they then failed to keep.",
      "But the Conservatives said Labour's decision to scrap the Tories' Rwanda deportation scheme would prove a \"huge mistake\".",
      "Also speaking to Kuenssberg, shadow home secretary Chris Philp said his party would seek to put in place a \"deterrent-style scheme\" if it returned to power.",
      "The number of migrants crossing the Channel in Labour's first five months in office is down on the same period in 2022, a record year for arrivals, but similar to the number who crossed in that period in 2021.",
      "Cooper said the number of crossings was still \"deeply damaging\" and \"dangerous\", and was undermining border security as well as putting lives at risk.",
      "\"Of course we want to continue to progress, of course we want to see the boat crossings come down as rapidly as possible.",
      "\"What we are not going to do is deal with this by slogans. Rishi Sunak said he'd stop the boats in a year.\"",
      "Asked whether the government's reluctance to set public targets on reducing the number of small boat crossings shows it was not a priority, Cooper said: \"Quite the opposite.",
      "\"We've made clear that border security is actually one of the foundational issues\".",
      "Labour has put action against people-smuggling gangs, as well as broader law enforcement efforts, at the heart of its strategy to reduce boat crossings.",
      "On Sunday, the Home Office published new figures showing a total of 13,460 foreign nationals had been returned to their home countries through both forced and voluntary departures since Labour came to office in July.",
      "The department said the number of enforced returns was up compared to the same period last year, arguing greater collaboration with other countries had made more return flights possible.",
      "Philp argued the uptick in returns was the continuation of a \"trend\" which had started before this year's election.",
      "Labour has also previously expressed an interest in studying Italy's deal with Albania, under which some migrants rescued by the Italian coastguard will be sent there to have their asylum claims processed.",
      "That five-year agreement has faced significant challenges, with transfers recently halted by a court in Rome.",
      "Asked whether Labour would also consider processing asylum claims offshore, Cooper said the government would \"look at whatever works\" but emphasised that any such scheme would need to be \"effective\".",
      "She also blamed an increase in hotel places for asylum seekers since the election on a \"collapse in decision-making\" ahead of the vote, which she argued had left Labour with a \"soaring backlog\" of cases on entering office.",
      "Speaking on Sky News, Home Office minister Angela Eagle defended the lack of an official timetable for reducing crossings, adding that the public wanted to see \"steady progress\" rather than a \"date snatched out of the air\".",
      "But Philp told the BBC Australia's offshore processing policies had shown that \"deterrent works\" - and pledged the Tories would aim to resurrect a Rwanda-style deal if they returned to power.",
      "It was \"telling\", he argued, that reducing Channel crossings had not featured in the six government \"milestones\" laid out by Sir Keir Starmer last week.",
      "The Conservatives under Kemi Badenoch have also separately committed to setting a cap on annual legal migration into the UK.",
      "Asked where the cap would be set, Philp did not offer details beyond saying it would be \"far, far lower\" than the 350,000 predicted for future years by official economic forecasters.",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "'No nice or easy way of doing it': Labour's small boats dilemma",

      "The new technology will support operational teams as they build cases \"against those working illegally in the UK or unscrupulous businesses employing them\".",
      "Biometric fingerprinting kits are set to be given to those on the frontline, which the government says will enable immigration enforcement officers to cross-check detained individuals against police databases \"on the spot\".",
      "The home secretary also suggested she hoped to fast-track claims from those seeking asylum from countries deemed safe.",
      "Cooper said that despite the lack of a specific \"milestone\" target on small boat crossings, border security remained a \"clear priority for the government\".",
      "Earlier this week, Germany and the UK agreed on a deal to tighten Berlin's law to make it easier to prosecute those helping to smuggle people into the UK.",
      "Under the new agreement, the Home Office says Germany has pledged to make the activity a clear criminal offence.",

    "summary": "Builders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.",
    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",

      "1,200 tilers",
      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

      "Sir Brian Leveson, a retired High Court judge, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"radical\" steps would need to be taken to tackle the \"crisis\" which has seen cases added to the criminal justice system \"faster than they can be removed.\"",
      "Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show 73,105 trials were unheard at the end of September, almost double the number in 2019.",
      "Sir Brian's report, due next year, will consider the creation of intermediate courts, where cases could be heard by a judge flanked by magistrates, to reduce the backlog.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the announcement of the review, Sir Brian said the number of prosecutions waiting to be dealt with was \"unsustainable\" - with listings now running into 2027.",
      "\"This isn't so much a challenge,\" he told the BBC, \"it's a crisis in the criminal justice system which has to be addressed\".",
      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",
      "\"The extent to which we can divert people from the criminal justice system is a live one and that's one of the areas I will be looking at,\" he said, adding intermediate courts currently do not exist, \"so you're either in the magistrates' court or you're in a Crown Court.\"",
      "One suggestion is that the jury could be replaced in many middle-ranking cases by a single district judge and two community magistrates.",
      "Sir Brian would consider whether magistrates should have a broader remit to deal with more cases, potentially including increasing their sentencing powers.",
      "On Thursday, Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood described the backlog as \"unprecedented\".",
      "\"We owe it to victims to find bold, innovative approaches that will speed up justice,\" she said, adding criminals should know \"they will quickly face the consequence of their actions.\"",
      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",
      "Fuelled by a surge of online misinformation, the riots saw buildings including mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers vandalised and dozens of police officers injured.",
      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",
      "\"People were being sentenced, convicted, tried, all within a speedy time,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that's the way we deter crime best - by early detection, early prosecution and early resolution.\"",
      "Sir Brian's report will land on ministers' desks around the same time as a parallel review of sentencing of offenders.",

      "Rethinking the 2006 police funding formula could bring Lincolnshire an extra 10% to 12% more cash.",
      "But better funded forces would lose money, creating a difficult political challenge for the government, so a new formula remains on the shelf.",

      "But some locals in the areas where these houses will need to be built are steadfast in their opposition to more housing.",
      "One rural corner of Kent is rapidly becoming a test case for how determined the government is to force through planning decisions in the teeth of local objections.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner stepped in at the last minute and took the decision about whether to go ahead with an 8,400 home development out of the local council's hands.",
      "While it's not unusual for ministers to intervene in planning applications, the scale of this potential development means it's being viewed by many as an early test of the government's approach.",

      "Bonney is not the only councillor opposing the proposals - the local Labour-led council was on the verge of voting to reject them.",
      "But at the eleventh hour it was \"called in\" by Housing Secretary Angela Rayner. This means the government will take over the planning application rather than let the local authority decide.",

    "summary": "What difference could the biggest shake up of local government in 50 years make to your area?",
    "story": [
      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",

      "It's a blunt reality check from a former Home Office minister describing one of the government's most pressing dilemmas - how to crack down on the illegal trade of smuggling people into Britain.",
      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "Responses from local councils to an Freedom of Information request by the BBC suggest the government could be on a collision course with local authorities.",

    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",
      "Earlier this year, a cross-party committee of MPs warned that the government had not maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones. A lack of funding has been a key issue.",

      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 19:14:10 GMT",
    "summary": "A new DNA analysis has shown that the arrival of modern humans from Africa was far from smooth.",
    "story": [
      "Far from triumphantly breezing out of Africa, modern humans went extinct many times before going on to populate the world, new studies have revealed.",
      "The new DNA research has also shed new light on the role our Neanderthal cousins played in our success.",
      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

    "summary": "The social media giant is currently seeking to delay a law that would see it banned or sold in early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump met the CEO of TikTok on Monday, as the social media giant fights plans by US authorities to ban it.",
      "Trump met Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported, citing sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "A law passed earlier this year means TikTok will be banned unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, before 19 January.",
      "The company has made an emergency application to the US Supreme Court to have the ban delayed.",
      "The US wants TikTok sold or banned because of alleged links between ByteDance and the Chinese state, links that both TikTok and ByteDance have always denied.",
      "The bill introducing the law said it was intended to \"protect the national security of the United States from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications\".",
      "Trump opposes the ban - despite supporting one during his first term - partly on the grounds that it could help Facebook, which he has accused of aiding his 2020 election loss.",
      "Trump's second term, however, won't begin until he is inaugurated on 20 January, the day after the deadline set out in the law.",
      "In its filing to the Supreme Court, submitted on Monday, TikTok asked for a \"modest delay\" to the enforcement of the ban to \"create breathing room\" for a review by the Court and to allow the incoming administration to \"evaluate this matter\".",
      "It described TikTok as \"one of the most significant speech platforms\" in the US and said the ban would do \"immediate irreparable harm\" to the company and its users.",
      "Earlier this month, the company's bid to have the ban overturned was rejected by the federal appeals court, which found that the law was the \"culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "Trump buoyant as big business and former foes fall in line",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "TikTok asks for emergency pause to looming US ban",
      "At a press conference on Monday, Trump said his administration would \"take a look at TikTok\".",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he said.",
      "\"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. TikTok had an impact.\"",
      "A majority of 18 to 29-year-olds backed Trump's Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in November, but the vote did see a significant swing towards Trump among young voters since the 2020 election.",
      "Trump only joined TikTok in June, but gained millions of followers on the platform over the course of the campaign."

      "Platforms have three months to carry out risk assessments identifying potential harms on their services or they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover.",

      "\"I'm asking the industry now to get moving, and if they don't they will be hearing from us with enforcement action from March.\"",
      "Under Ofcom's codes, platforms will need to identify if, where and how illegal content might appear on their services and ways they will stop it reaching users",

      "\"Today's proposals will at best lock in the inertia to act, and at worst create a loophole which means services can evade tackling abuse in private messaging without fear of enforcement.\"",
      "The OSA became law in October 2023, following years of wrangling by politicians over its detail and scope, and campaigning by people concerned over the impact of social media on young people.",
      "Ofcom began consulting on its illegal content codes that November, and says it has now \"strengthened\" its guidance for tech firms in several areas.",
      "Ofcom codes",
      "Ofcom says its codes include greater clarity around requirements to take down intimate image abuse content, and more guidance on how to identify and remove material related to women being coerced into sex work.",
      "It also includes child safety features such as ensuring that social media platforms stop suggesting people befriend children's accounts and warnings about risks of sharing personal information.",
      "Certain platforms must also use a technology called hash-matching to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) - a requirement that now applies to smaller file hosting and storage sites.",
      "Hash matching is where media is given a unique digital signature which can be checked against hashes belonging to known content - in this case, databases of known CSAM.",
      "Many large tech firms have already brought in safety measures for teenage users and controls to give parents more oversight of their social media activity in a bid to tackle dangers for teens and pre-empt regulations.",
      "For instance, on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, users under the age of 18 cannot be discovered in search or messaged by accounts they do not follow.",
      "In October, Instagram also started blocking some screenshots in direct messages to try and combat sextortion attempts - which experts have warned are on the rise, often targeting young men.",
      "Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said Ofcom's publication of its codes was a \"significant step\" towards the government's aim of making the internet safer for people in the UK.",
      "\"These laws mark a fundamental reset in society's expectations of technology companies,\" he said.",
      "\"I expect them to deliver and will be watching closely to make sure they do.\"",
      "'Snail's pace'",
      "Concerns have been raised throughout the OSA's journey over its rules applying to a huge number of varied online services - with campaigners also frequently warning about the privacy implications of platform age verification requirements.",
      "And parents of children who died after exposure to illegal or harmful content have previously criticised Ofcom for moving at a \"snail's pace\".",
      "The regulator's illegal content codes will still need to be approved by parliament before they can come fully into force on 17 March.",
      "But platforms are being told now, with the presumption that the codes will have no issue passing through parliament, and firms must have measures in place to prevent users from accessing outlawed material by this date."

      "Amazon said it was fair for the firm to focus safety comparisons on larger warehouses.",

      "It said another team asked to review the recommendations of Amazon's internal safety study had found that the methodology was \"unsound\".",
      "\"Nothing\" is more important to the firm than employee safety, Amazon said.",

      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has donated $1m (\u00a3786,000) to an inauguration fund for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The tech giant's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in November, having sought to repair his and his firm's relationship with Trump following the election.",
      "Trump previously was highly critical of Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook - calling the platform \"anti-Trump\" in 2017.",
      "Meta is not believed to have made similar donations to President Joe Biden's  inaugural fund in 2020 or to Trump's previous inaugural fund in 2016.",
      "The company confirmed its million-dollar donation to the inaugural fund to several outlets on Wednesday.",
      "Inauguration funds are used to pay for events and activities when a new president takes office - some consider them an attempt to curry favour with a new administration.",

      "Relations between Trump and Mr Zuckerberg historically have been far less cordial.",
      "They particularly soured when Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January.",
      "Since then, Trump has waged a war of words against Meta - calling Facebook an \"enemy of the people\" in March.",
      "He said a law that would ban TikTok in the US unless sold off by its parent company, ByteDance, would unfairly benefit Facebook.",

    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:52:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Kirillov, who has been killed in Moscow, was accused by the West of overseeing the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "As head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops, Igor Kirillov - who has died in an explosion in Moscow - was accused by the West of overseeing the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.",
      "In Russia, he was viewed as a tireless patriot, fighting for the truth and exposing Western \"crimes\".",
      "Sources from Ukraine's SBU security service said it it was behind the blast and described it as a special operation against a \"war criminal\" and a legitimate target.",
      "Kirillov and an aide were killed by explosives planted in an electric scooter, according to Russian officials, which was blown up as he left the building he lived in on Ryazansky Prospekt in south-eastern Moscow.",
      "He had become notorious for outlandish briefings at the Russian defence ministry which prompted the UK Foreign Office to label him as a \"significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation\".",
      "Kirillov was far more than just a mouthpiece, heading Russia's Timoshenko Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Academy, before going on to lead the Russian army's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops in 2017.",
      "The force's main tasks involve identifying hazards and protecting units from contamination but also \"causing loss to the enemy by using flame-incendiary means\", the Russian defence ministry says. That is thought to refer to Russia's flame-thrower system that can destroy targets with the use of thermobaric warheads.",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that the force Kirillov commanded had deployed \"barbaric chemical weapons in Ukraine\", highlighting what it said was the widespread use of riot control agents and \"multiple reports of the use of the toxic choking agent chloropicrin\".",
      "On the eve of his killing, Ukraine's SBU declared that he had been named in absentia in a criminal case for the \"mass use\" of prohibited chemical weapons on the eastern and southern fronts in Ukraine.",
      "It cited \"more than 4,800 cases of the enemy using chemical munitions\" on Ukrainian territory since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.",
      "It said toxic substances had been used in drone attacks as well as in combat grenades.",
      "Kirillov earned his notoriety from the start of the war with a series of claims directed towards both Ukraine and the West, none of which were based on fact.",
      "Among his most outrageous claims was one that the US had been building biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. It was used in an attempt to justify the full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in 2022.",
      "He produced documents in March 2022 which he claimed had been seized by Russia on the day of the invasion on 24 February - which were amplified by pro-Kremlin media but rubbished by independent experts.",
      "Kirillov's notorious allegations against Ukraine continued into this year.",
      "Last month he claimed that \"one of the priority aims\" of Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk border region was to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant.",
      "He presented a slideshow, purportedly based on a Ukrainian report, alleging that in the event of an accident only Russia territory would be exposed to radioactive contamination.",
      "One of Kirillov's repeated themes was that Ukraine was seeking to develop a \"dirty bomb\".",
      "Two years ago he alleged that \"two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called 'dirty bomb'. This work is in its final stage\".",
      "His claims were rejected by Western countries as \"transparently false\".",
      "But Kirillov's claims prompted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to warn that if Russia suggested Kyiv was preparing that kind of weapon, it meant only one thing - that Russia was already preparing it.",
      "Kirillov returned to his dirty bomb claims last summer, this time alleging the discovery of a chemical weapons laboratory close to Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that the Russians captured last February.",
      "Kyiv, he claimed, was violating the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) with a variety of substances with the assistance of Western countries, including the psychochemical warfare agent BZ as well as hydrocyanic acid and cyanogen chloride.",
      "Russia is a signatory to the CWC and was adjudged to have destroyed all its Cold War-era chemical weapons in 2017 - the same year that Moscow was accused of carrying out two chemical attacks: one in the British city of Salisbury and another on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.",
      "The US has since accused Russia of using the choking agent chloropicrin on the battlefield in Ukraine.",
      "Kirillov's violent death has come as a shock to Russia's military and political establishment. A minute's silence was observed in Russia's parliament, the Duma.",
      "The deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, Konstantin Kosachev, said his death was an \"irreparable loss\", while retired general and MP Andrei Gurulyov said Kirillov's killing would not go unanswered.",
      "Gurulyov said he was responsible for procuring weapons that should only be seen on the battlefield and clearly understood the \"criminal activities of the US and its satellites\".",
      "His death is also seen by pro-Kremlin loyalists as not just a blow, but also evidence that Ukraine has the ability to target high-profile officials in Moscow.",
      "Some commentators even pointed a finger at the British or the Americans. According to Russian war correspondent Sasha Kots, it proves enemy agents are operating and spying on people \"in our rear\".",

    "summary": "The official outlines a phased plan which would see hostages freed in step with Israeli pullouts.",
    "story": [
      "After months of deadlock, there are new signs that Israel and Hamas could be moving closer to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "A senior Palestinian official involved in the indirect negotiations told the BBC that  talks were in a \"decisive and final phase\".",
      "Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, has also said an agreement is closer than ever.",
      "In recent weeks, the US, Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts \u2013 reporting greater willingness by both sides in this 14-month war to conclude a deal.",
      "An Israeli delegation described as \"working level\" is currently in the Qatari capital Doha amid a flurry of diplomatic comings and goings in the region.",
      "The Palestinian official outlined a three-phase plan which would see civilians and women soldiers held hostage in Gaza released in the first 45 days, with Israeli forces pulling out of city centres, the coastal road and the strategic strip of land along the border with Egypt.",
      "There would be a mechanism for displaced Gazans to be able to return to the north of the territory, the official said.",
      "A second stage would see remaining hostages freed and troops withdrawn before the third stage ending the war.",
      "Of 96 hostages still held in Gaza, 62 are assumed by Israel to still be alive.",
      "The plan appears to be based on the deal US President Joe Biden outlined on 31 May and reports from all sides stress there are key details to work out.",
      "A round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.",
      "According to his spokesman, Katz told members of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs committee on Monday: \"We have not been this close to an agreement on the hostages since the previous deal,\" referring to an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israel in November 2023.",
      "He has since written on X: \"My position on Gaza is clear. After we defeat Hamas's military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action,\" comparing this to the situation in the occupied West Bank.",
      "\"We will not allow any terrorist activity against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before 7 October.\"",
      "Such comments are likely to be seen as problematic by negotiators trying to bridge gaps with Hamas.  However, in Israel, they are seen as vital to guarantee the support of far-right Israeli cabinet ministers who have previously warned they would not agree to what they have described as a \"reckless\" deal in Gaza.",
      "The Palestinian Islamist armed group Hamas, which governed Gaza, carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023.  About 1,200 people were killed and 253 others abducted.",
      "More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations.",
      "On 7 December, it is understood from Palestinian sources that Israel stopped aircraft movement and drone surveillance over the territory for six hours at the request of mediators, allowing Hamas to collect information about the hostages.",
      "Pro-Qatari newspaper al-Araby al-Jadeed then reported that Hamas had handed a list of sick and elderly Israeli hostages as well as those with US citizenship to Egyptian intelligence officials. The paper said there were also the names of Palestinian prisoners that the group was demanding as part of the deal.",
      "At the outset of the war in Gaza, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas's governing and military capabilities. More than 45,000 Palestinians have since been killed according to figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which are seen as reliable by the UN and others.",
      "Most of the 2.3 million population of Gaza has been displaced, there has been widespread destruction and amid an ongoing struggle to get aid to those in need, there is now mass hunger.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in November's US presidential election has given a new push to diplomatic efforts.",
      "At a news conference on Monday, he again warned that a ceasefire deal should be reached before he takes office, saying otherwise, \"it's not going to be pleasant.\""

    "summary": "The daughter of Angola's former president was described by the UK government as a \"notorious kleptocrat\".",
    "story": [
      "Angolan tycoon Isabel dos Santos, once dubbed \"Africa's richest woman\", has hit out at the UK for imposing sanctions on her, telling the BBC the move came as a surprise as she had not been found guilty of \"any corruption in any court in any country\".",
      "Last month, the daughter of Angola's former president was described by the UK government as a \"notorious kleptocrat\" and slapped with an asset freeze and travel ban for allegedly siphoning wealth out of oil-rich Angola.",
      "She said Angola's government was behind a campaign to tarnish her image.",
      "\"It's political at the end of the day,\" Dos Santos, 51, told the BBC Africa Daily podcast from her base in Dubai.",
      "\"There was not an inquiry, where somebody came and investigated and looked at evidence or asked me to clarify. There was no due process,\" she said.",
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the sanctions on Dos Santos as part of his campaign to crack down on \"dirty money\".",
      "A government statement alleged she had \"systematically abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least \u00a3350m [$442m], depriving Angola of resources and funding for much-needed development\".",
      "A spokesperson for Angola's attorney-general said it was not a political institution and only investigated evidence of alleged criminality. They said she had been accused of several crimes and so needed to defend herself.",
      "A spokesperson for the British foreign office said that under Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations, the UK could \"designate an individual where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is or has been involved in serious corruption\". They also pointed out that anyone sanctioned could ask for a review at any time.",
      "The allegations against Dos Santos, which she denies, were first made in 2020 when BBC Panorama reported on leaked documents that had been shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",
      "The expos\u00e9 , known as \"Luanda Leaks\", alleged that one of the most suspicious deals had been made via a London-based company.",

      "LISTEN: Africa Daily's Isabel dos Santos interview",
      "Africa's richest woman 'ripped off Angola'",
      "Angola's Isabel dos Santos eyes the presidency",
      "Dos Santos, the eldest daughter of former President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos - in power from 1979 to 2017 - was educated at private schools in the UK during Angola's long civil war.",
      "After graduating from King's College London as an electrical engineer, she took up an office job at a consultancy firm in Europe.",
      "But in her early twenties, Dos Santos decided she wanted to pursue a more entrepreneurial career back home, telling the BBC she started out by delivering crates of beer - Uber style - to restaurants and shops.",
      "She went on to build a huge business empire, setting up a mobile phone company, a satellite TV operator, a commercial bank, a brewery and a cement factory - with stakes in other companies in Angola and Portugal.",
      "A month before her 40th birthday, she made it to Forbes magazine's rich list and was not only said to be Africa's richest woman but also the continent's youngest billionaire.",
      "Dos Santos told BBC Africa Daily she never thought of herself in that way but did see herself as a \"pioneer\".",
      "\"I'm also my country's largest private employer. I've created over 200,000 jobs. I've been one of my country's largest taxpayers and contributed the most to build Angola's economy.\"",
      "In 2016, she was controversially put in charge of the struggling state-owned oil firm, Sonangol. Her appointment was challenged by critics at the time but the Supreme Court stood by it, she said.",
      "\"I did have a track record in the private sector. I have a particular knowledge of turning around companies... that are not doing well, to drive them to efficiency.\"",
      "Some of the most serious allegations of corruption against her date from her time in charge of Sonangol.",
      "Within months of her father stepping down in 2017, she was sacked by his chosen successor, President Joao Louren\u00e7o, and two years later her assets were frozen.",
      "The former first daughter of Angola believes Louren\u00e7o, who targeted the Dos Santos family as part of an anti-corruption drive, has betrayed her father: \"He started blaming the past, saying that everything that happened before him was bad.",
      "\"But he himself is from the [ruling] MPLA, he was the vice-president of the party. He was minister of defence.",
      "\"If anything, I think he had a lot more to do with the Angolan economy and the Angolan decision-making and the political decision-making than most Angolans.\"",
      "Dos Santos is also angry that despite her assets being frozen in Angola five years ago, the case has not yet been heard in court - something she says would usually happen within, at most, 18 months as it is a civil case that tends to involve allegations of unpaid debts. She says she faces no criminal proceedings.",
      "She also alleges that the original freezing order was based on faked documents, including a passport in her name bearing the signature of late martial arts expert Bruce Lee.",
      "The spokesperson for Angola's attorney-general said they would not discuss the details of any ongoing legal disputes in public but said that any evidence that documents had been falsified should be presented in court.",
      "By 2021 Forbes had dropped her from its list of top billionaires - Dos Santos explains that the asset freeze means she can no longer get dividend payments and is barred from receiving any financial contributions from her companies.",
      "The mother of three has also had to contend with personal losses over the last few years - her husband died in a diving accident and when her father died in 2022, she did not go back to Angola to attend his funeral.",
      "If she were to return to Angola, she may well face arrest - at the government's behest, Interpol has issued a Red Notice, which is a request to \"locate and provisionally arrest\" someone, however it is not an international arrest warrant.",
      "Dos Santos says after these difficult years and further asset freezes, she now wants people to hear her side of a \"complex\" story to \"hopefully start clarifying the misconceptions that exist\".",
      "When asked if she would ever stand for the presidency, she said it was \"a possibility\" - echoing comments she made to the BBC four years ago.",
      "\"Look, I will always serve my country,\" she said. \"To lead is to serve, and I wish to serve Angola, whether it's in politics, or whether it's in business, whether it's in philanthropy, or culture.\"",

      "\"We've had no water for three days now,\" said one resident of the capital city Mamoudzou. \"Some of my neighbours are hungry and thirsty,\" another one said.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said he will be travelling to Mayotte \"in the coming days\", as he pledged to support fellow citizens, civil servants and emergency services involved in rescue efforts.",
      "Are you in Mayotte? Please share your experiencesWhat are cyclones?",
      "Are you in Mayotte? Please share your experiences",
      "What are cyclones?",
      "Rescue workers, including reinforcements from France, are combing through the debris searching for survivors. Twenty people have been confirmed dead, but the local prefect said it could be thousands.",
      "Macron said he will declare a national day of mourning, in light of \"this tragedy, which has shaken each and every one of us\".",
      "Authorities said they were having difficulty establishing the number of deaths due to the large number of undocumented migrants - over 100,000 - in a population of 320,000.",
      "Widespread damage to infrastructure - with downed power lines and impassable roads - is severely hindering emergency operations.",
      "Supplies have begun to arrive, but there are severe shortages of food, water and shelter in certain areas. Some 85% of the territory remains without power, and about 20% of phones appear to be working. Some areas are beginning to get tap water.",
      "But for Amalia Mazon, a 27-year-old midwife from Brussels who has been working at the island's central hospital, access to drinking water and food continues to be a concern.",
      "\"The water here is completely yellow. It's unusable for us,\" Ms Mazon told the BBC.",
      "\"We feel completely abandoned, and we don't even know if help is coming. We have no news, we have no idea,\" the midwife added.",
      "Acting French health minister Genevi\u00e8ve Darrieussecq said the healthcare system in the archipelago had been \"degraded\" by the cyclone.",
      "France colonised Mayotte in 1841 - and by the turn of the 20th Century added the three main islands that constitute the Comoros archipelago to its overseas territories.",
      "The Comoros voted to become independent in 1974 but Mayotte decided to remain part of France.",
      "The island's population is heavily dependent on French financial aid and has struggled with poverty, unemployment and political instability.",
      "About 75% of the population live below the national poverty line and unemployment hovers at around one in three.",
      "\"The images are apocalyptic. It's a disaster, there's nothing left,\" a nurse working at the main hospital in Mamoudzou told BFM TV.",

      "\"It's the hunger that worries me most,\" Mayotte Senator Salama Ramia told French media. \"There are people who have had nothing to eat or drink\" since Saturday, she said.",
      "Francois-Xavier Bieuville, the island's prefect, told local media the death toll could rise significantly once the damage was fully assessed. He warned it would \"definitely be several hundred\" and could reach the thousands.",
      "Mayotte's impoverished communities, including undocumented migrants who have travelled to the French territory in an effort to claim asylum, are thought to have been particularly hard hit due to the vulnerable nature of their housing.",
      "The Muslim tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours also meant documenting the number of those who have perished was more difficult, the prefect said.",
      "In addition to aid, 110 French soldiers have arrived to help with the rescue, with another 160 on the way. Some 800 others from the ranks of volunteers helping during emergencies were also being sent to join local police units.",
      "After arriving in Mayotte, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said \"days and days\" would be needed to ascertain human losses.",
      "The relief operation is being co-ordinated from Reunion - another French overseas territory.",
      "French Red Cross spokesman Eric Sam Vah told the BBC the situation was \"chaotic\".",

      "\"The totality of the slums have been totally destroyed, we haven't received any reports of displaced people, so the reality could be terrible in the coming days,\" the spokesman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Cyclone Chido also made landfall in Mozambique, where it brought flash flooding, uprooted trees and damaged buildings about 25 miles (40km) south of the northern city of Pemba. Three deaths have been reported.",
      "The cyclone caused structural damage and power outages in the northern coastal provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado on Saturday morning, local authorities reported.",
      "Guy Taylor, a spokesperson for aid agency Unicef in Mozambique, said \"we were hit very hard in the early hours of this morning\".",
      "\"Many houses were destroyed or seriously damaged, and healthcare facilities and schools are out of action,\" he added.",
      "Mr Taylor said Unicef was concerned about \"loss of access to critical services\", including medical treatment, clean water and sanitation, and also \"the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria\".",
      "Chido is the latest deadly storm to form of such high intensity.",
      "It strengthened as a result of its long track over the ocean, says Sarah Keith-Lucas from the BBC Weather Centre. The cyclone would have weakened had it made landfall on Madagascar's rugged terrain.",
      "But it is also the case that climate change has an impact - not necessarily in the frequency of storms but in the strength, Keith-Lucas says.",
      "The storm has been now downgraded to a \"depression\" and is due to cross southern Malawi, then Mozambique's Tete province, before heading towards Zimbabwe overnight into Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's National Security Council has paused the implementation of the controversial \"hijab and chastity law\", which had been due to come into force on Friday.",
      "President Massoud Pezeshkian called the legislation \"ambiguous and in need of reform\", signalling his intention to reassess its measures.",
      "The proposed new law - which would introduce harsher punishments for women and girls for exposing their hair, forearms or lower legs - had been heavily criticised by rights activists.",
      "The strict dress codes imposed on women and girls, which have been treated as a national security priority by the rulers of the Islamic Republic of Iran for decades, have previously triggered protests.",
      "Under the new law, repeat offenders and anyone who mocked the rules would face heavier fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years in jail. It would also mandate that businesses report anyone who violates the rules.",
      "Human rights groups had expressed alarm. Amnesty International said Iranian authorities were \"seeking to entrench the already suffocating system of repression\".",
      "During the presidential election in July, then candidate Pezeshkian openly criticised the treatment of Iranian women over the hijab issue.",
      "He promised not to interfere in their personal lives, a stance that resonated with many Iranians, especially from a younger generation frustrated by the government's rigid control.",

      "Despite pressure from hardline factions close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, many younger people in Iran appear to be unafraid to confront the regime's restrictions.",
      "Pezeshkian's supporters believe the new hijab law will fail to discourage young women from defying it and could even worsen the situation.",
      "However, supporters of the legislation have pressured the president to move forward, criticising the National Security Council's hesitation and demanding that he sign the law to clear the path for its enforcement.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:34:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite losing, the result was the outcome the SDP leader wanted and paves the way for early elections.",
    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.",
      "It comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.",
      "Ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign.",
      "Losing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.",
      "Thanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.",
      "There were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Since Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.",
      "Given Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.",
      "Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.",
      "Opening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts.",
      "'Kamikaze' move",
      "Scholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.",
      "The process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.",
      "This vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00f6der deployed on two occasions.",
      "However, there is a deeper problem within German politics.",
      "On the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.",
      "That was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.",
      "Lindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.",
      "Germany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.",
      "In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.",
      "In 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%.",
      "Germany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart",
      "Germany plans February election after coalition collapse",
      "The AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.",
      "The bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.",
      "That was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.",
      "Rather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties.",
      "Another new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall.",
      "The conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.",
      "They refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.",
      "That leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.",
      "Whatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over."

      "But the court said on Monday it could run Yoon's trial with just six judges, and set a preliminary hearing date for 27 December.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:14:31 GMT",
    "summary": "In the years before the mass rape trial that has shocked France, Gis\u00e8le almost caught Dominique Pelicot.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse",
      "It was November 2011, and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was sleeping too much.",
      "She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.",
      "Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed.",
      "Despite this, Gis\u00e8le, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lanc\u00f4me, their French bulldog, on long walks.",
      "She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gis\u00e8le would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s \u2013 but they had made it through.",
      "Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\"",
      "By that point, Gis\u00e8le and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box.",
      "He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as \u2013 in his own daughter's words \u2013 \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\".",
      "But in 2011, when Gis\u00e8le felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out.",
      "She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material \u2013 often extreme or illegal \u2013 was freely available.",
      "In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\"",
      "Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gis\u00e8le.",
      "At first he hesitated \u2013 but not for long.",
      "Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles.",
      "He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake.",
      "Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation.",
      "He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later.",
      "On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife.",
      "He would film them too.",
      "He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat.",
      "As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death.",
      "Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them.",
      "\"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gis\u00e8le was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\"",
      "Police station visit changed everything",
      "Sometimes, Gis\u00e8le came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\"",
      "Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts.",
      "Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gis\u00e8le was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission \u2013 drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied.",
      "Gis\u00e8le only felt better when she was away from Mazan \u2013 an oddity she barely noticed.",
      "It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.",
      "She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\".",
      "She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help.",
      "He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said.",
      "But Dominique must have known the end was near.",
      "Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others.",
      "\"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Bosse Plati\u00e8re, the director of the investigation, told the court.",
      "\"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague St\u00e9phane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\"",
      "His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology.",
      "They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless.",
      "Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Plati\u00e8re said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\"",
      "On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" \u2013  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes.",
      "\"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.",
      "At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.",
      "When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\".",
      "She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened.",
      "Recalling that moment, Gis\u00e8le said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her.",
      "'You cannot imagine the unimaginable'",
      "David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gis\u00e8le's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\".",
      "He and Gis\u00e8le wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024.",
      "By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gis\u00e8le's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "\"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\"",
      "Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" \u2013 pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gis\u00e8le as they didn't realise she was unconscious.",
      "\"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gis\u00e8le turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\"",
      "Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gis\u00e8le was clearly traumatised but calm and distant \u2013 a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks.",
      "Gis\u00e8le herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.",
      "Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gis\u00e8le \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\"",
      "Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised.",
      "Gis\u00e8le has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique.",
      "She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired.",
      "In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand.",
      "A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gis\u00e8le was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening?",
      "Pierre shook his head.",

      "Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.",

      "Her two sisters, Ala and Jana, nod in agreement as we sit, squeezed together on this cold winter's day, on an old lumpy sofa in their humble home in Homs.",
      "Their white-bearded father, Farhan Abdul Ghani, sitting cross legged on the floor, chimes in. \"We did not want war. We did not want a forever president who builds monuments to himself.\"",
      "Nearly a decade ago, we first met in the worst days of that war, waged in their president's name.",
      "Baraa, a deeply traumatised little girl whose eyes darted wildly back and forth, struggled to speak then.",
      "\"Sometimes people killed cats to eat,\" she blurted out as she sat in a disused banquet hall milling with aid officials, Syrian security forces, and distraught families.",
      "For months, many had little to eat except grass pulled from the ground, leaves from the trees, boiled in water with salt and sometimes cinnamon.",
      "\"Instead of learning to read and write, I learned about weapons,\" Baraa told us then so matter-of-factly.",
      "Homs was once called the \"capital of the revolution\" by peaceful protesters who first took to the streets in the spring of 2011 to call for change, before it turned into all-out war.",
      "Baraa and her family were among a thousand civilians rescued from the Old City during a rare UN-supervised humanitarian pause in February 2014.",
      "They somehow survived the agonising two-year-long siege of the old quarter where Syrian troops enforced their first \"surrender or starve\" cordon in this merciless war.",
      "This medieval torture tactic turned into one of their cruellest weapons, unleashed against one rebel-held stronghold after another.",
      "Months later, more civilians were also given safe passage out of the Old City, as well as the fighters who moved on to continue their fight in other parts of Syria.",
      "The years until this week have been hard on this family and so many others.",
      "\"I felt as if I was asleep and I lost hope,\" Baraa recalls as she adjusts the white headscarf worn by her and her sisters. \"We were always afraid of saying the wrong thing, even at the university.\"",
      "Now, like so many Syrians, she is brimming with palpable joy and optimism in these early heady days of a new start.",
      "\"I am dreaming of so many things now, to finish university, to do a master's degree, to improve my English.\" Her voice trails off as her big goals fill this modest little room.",

      "His meagre earnings from his fruit and vegetable cart, as well as the kindness of friends, kept them striving for a better life.",

      "This aching hurt and exhilarating happiness is palpable, especially for Syrians now able to make a bittersweet return to Homs. Entire sections are still jagged cityscapes of grey rubble and gaping ruins.",
      "\"I needed to see this again but it brings painful flashbacks,\" Dr Hayan al-Abrash remarks as his eyes scan the haunting landscape of loss in the neighbourhood of Khalidiyah, pulverised by Syrian firepower.",
      "He points to the skeletal remains of a soaring building whose facade was shaved off by a scud missile. It brought two other buildings crashing to the ground.",
      "He was also forced to leave the besieged Old City in 2014, leaving behind his makeshift underground hospital there and in nearby Khalidiyah.",
      "He struggles to locate it until a shopkeeper shows up to unlock and unfurl a metal shutter. It reveals a gutted warehouse with rickety metal stairs leading into a dark dank basement.",
      "\"Yes, yes, this is it,\" he declares excitedly as our flashlights illuminate the cavernous space, including another set of stairs. \"This is where the patients entered,\" he explains.",
      "\"Sometimes I brought friends, neighbours, my own cousin, down these stairs on my back.\"",
      "It is next to a wall daubed with arrows pointing to the \"emergency room\" as well as \"the road to death\" - humour even darker than this room.",
      "The green and black flag of the opposition, now ubiquitous, stands out.",
      "Empty medicine vials and dirty cardboard packets litter a far corner of the room where the wall is charred.",
      "\"The regime lit that fire in revenge,\" he says with rising emotion. \"They feared doctors, lawyers, political figures even more than they feared the fighters.\"",
      "\"It makes me very angry to see this,\" he emphasises.",
      "I ask if it makes him want to take revenge.",
      "\"It's not a time for revenge,\" he says. \"It's a time to build Syria for everyone, but not for those who killed us and have blood on his hands who must be put on trial.",
      "\"We don't forgive. It's impossible for us.\"",
      "Everyone we spoke to in Homs said its residents, Muslims and Christians, would rebuild together - and the stories we heard seemed to confirm that.",
      "Dr Hayan also takes us to see the site of another underground hospital in the Old City \u2013 it was in a spacious church basement where the walls are now lined with stacked chairs and tables for family gatherings.",
      "Farhan and his daughters insisted on taking us to see where they took cover during most of their time during the siege \u2013 a shelter in the Jesuit monastery run then by the charismatic Father Frans der Lugt.",
      "The Dutch priest, murdered in the Old City when he refused to leave its trapped and starving residents, is now buried on the grounds.",
      "The current pastor Father Tony Homsy is taken by surprise when we suddenly appear with Farhan, flanked by his daughters, emotionally scrolling through his phone to find photographs from that time.",
      "The Syrian Jesuit priest leads us down the stairs into the narrow room now used for daily mass, recently transformed into a Christmas grotto with a sparkling Nativity Scene.",
      "\"This is a very beautiful story,\" he marvels as our little delegation almost fills the space. \"In this grotto which symbolises how Jesus and the Holy Family found refuge, there is also the story of this Muslim family.\"",
      "Father Tony, who heads the Catholic Church in Homs, has also been able to see his own family in the northern city of Aleppo for the first time in years.",
      "He too dares to dream big. \"It's time to go forward,\" he asserts, quoting Father Frans, who he says inspired him to join the Jesuits.",
      "But he cautions \"it will take time to heal our wounds, to heal our memories\"."

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:47:47 GMT",
    "summary": "India's federal government is seeking to bring a controversial bill for holding federal and state assembly elections together.",
    "story": [
      "India, the world's largest democracy, is almost always in election mode.",
      "With 28 states, eight union territories and nearly a billion eligible voters, polls are a constant feature of the nation's political landscape.",
      "For years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has championed the idea of \"One Nation, One Election\" -  a proposal to hold state and federal elections simultaneously every five years.",
      "On Tuesday, the Indian law minister introduced a bill to implement this system in the parliament sparking a debate over power dynamics.",
      "Supporters argue this approach would slash campaign costs, ease the strain on administrative resources and streamline governance.",
      "Former President Ram Nath Kovind, who led a nine-member committee that recommended holding elections at the same time last year, called it a \"game changer\", citing economists who say it could boost India's GDP by up to 1.5%.",
      "Critics, however, warn it could erode India's federal structure, concentrating power in the center and weakening states' autonomy.",
      "What is one nation, one election?",
      "India's democracy operates on multiple levels, each with its own election cycle.",
      "There are general elections to choose parliament members, state elections to pick legislators, while rural and urban councils hold separate votes for local governance. By-elections fill vacancies caused by resignation, death or disqualification of representatives.",
      "These elections happen every five years, but at different times. The government now wants to sync them.",
      "In March, a panel led by Kovind proposed holding state and general elections together in its extensive 18,626-page report. It also recommended local body elections within 100 days.",
      "The committee suggested that if a government loses an election, fresh polls would be held, but its tenure would last only until the next synchronised election.",
      "While this may sound intense, simultaneous polls aren't new to India. They were the norm from the first election in 1951 until 1967, when political upheavals and early dissolutions of state assemblies led to staggered polls.",
      "Efforts to revive the system have been debated for decades, with proposals from the Election Commission in 1983, the Law Commission in 1999 and Niti Aayog, a government think-tank, in 2017.",
      "Does India need simultaneous elections?",
      "The biggest argument for holding simultaneous elections is cutting election costs.",
      "According to the Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Media Studies, India spent more than 600bn rupees ($7.07bn; \u00a35.54bn) on 2019 general elections, making it the world's most expensive at the time.",
      "However, critics argue that the same goal - reducing costs - could backfire.",
      "With 900 million eligible voters, ensuring enough electronic voting machines, security forces and election officials would require extensive planning and resources.",
      "According to a 2015 parliamentary committee report by the law and justice Department, India already spends 45bn rupees on general and state elections.",
      "The report mentioned if simultaneous elections were held then a total 92.84bn rupees would be needed to procure new voting and voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. These machines would also need to be replaced every 15 years.",
      "Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi has raised concerns about the high costs. He said they should have been addressed in the Kovind committee report, especially since reducing election expenses was a key reason behind the proposal.",
      "What are the key challenges in implementing this proposal?",
      "Implementing simultaneous elections requires making formal changes or revisions to specific provisions (or articles) of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country. Some of these changes would need ratification by at least half of India's 28 state assemblies.",
      "While the BJP-led alliance has a simple majority in parliament, it lacks the two-thirds majority needed for such amendments.",
      "The Kovind committee studied models from countries like South Africa, Sweden and Indonesia, suggesting their best practices for India.",
      "In September, the cabinet approved the proposal to hold simultaneous elections and backed two bills pushing for the system on Thursday.",
      "Federal Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has introduced the bills in the parliament.",
      "One bill proposes a constitutional amendment to enable joint federal and state elections, while another aims to align assembly polls in Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir with the general election schedule.",
      "The government has said it is open to referring the bills to a parliamentary committee and consult political parties to build consensus.",
      "Who supports the proposal, and who opposes it?",
      "The Kovind committee contacted all Indian parties for feedback, with 47 responding - 32 supported simultaneous elections, while 15 opposed them.",
      "Most supporters were BJP allies or friendly parties, citing time, cost and resource savings.",
      "The BJP argued that the model code of conduct cost India \"800 days of governance\" in the past five years by delaying welfare schemes.",
      "Prime Minister Modi has supported simultaneous elections.",
      "\"Frequent elections are obstructing the nation's advancement,\" he said in August. \"With elections occurring every three to six months, every scheme is linked to polls.\"",
      "Opposition parties, led by the Congress, have called simultaneous polls \"undemocratic\" and argued that they undermine the country's parliamentary system of government. They say such a setup will give an unfair advantage to national parties over regional ones.",
      "The parties also recommended enhancing transparency in the funding process as a better solution to addressing concerns about election costs.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:17:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Quentin Sommerville is on patrol with HTS in Latakia, as they pledge to protect minorities.",
    "story": [
      "Noor stands trembling in the chill afternoon light of the courtyard, not from the cold, but from fear.",
      "Dressed in her thick winter coat, she has come to make a complaint to the men of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.",
      "She begins to cry as she explains that three days earlier, just before nine in the evening, armed men had arrived in a black van at her apartment in an upscale neighbourhood of the city of Latakia. Along with her children and her husband, an army officer, she was forced out onto the street in her pyjamas. The leader of the armed men then moved his own family into her home.",
      "Noor - not her real name - is Alawite, the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Latakia, on Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is their heartland.",
      "As with other cities, an array of different rebel groups have rushed into the power vacuum left after Assad's soldiers abandoned their posts. The regime had exploited sectarian divisions to maintain its grip on power, now the Sunni Islamist HTS has pledged to respect all religions in Syria. But Latakia's Alawite population is fearful.",
      "Some people haven't even left their homes since the regime change because they worry that there will be a reckoning, and that they will have to pay a heavy price for the support of the old regime.",
      "Noor shows CCTV footage from her apartment, to 34-year-old Abu Ayoub, HTS general security commander. In the film, a group of bearded fighters, some wearing baseball caps and others in military fatigues, is pictured on her doorstep.",
      "They are not from HTS, she says, but another group, rebels from the northern city of Aleppo.",
      "\"They broke down the door. There were 10 militants at our door and 16 others waiting down the street with three cars,\" Noor tells Abu Ayoub. His men are mostly from Idlib and Aleppo, where the HTS and allied rebel factions were based before launching the offensive that overthew Assad three weeks ago. They stand around in combat fatigues, holding their rifles and listening intently as she describes how the family's belongings were thrown into the street.",
      "HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries, although the UK and US say they have been in contact with the group. In a matter of weeks, it has gone from enemy of the state to the law of the land. Abu Ayoub and his men are adjusting to the change in roles from revolutionaries to policemen.",
      "Noor is only one of a long line of complainants who have come to their general security station with grievances. The base, the city's former military intelligence headquarters, was perhaps the most feared place in Latakia. Now it is a shambles, with broken radios and equipment scattered across the courtyard. Torn portraits of Bashar al-Assad lie in the dirt.",
      "A man joins the queue of those making complaints. He has a black eye, broken ribs, and his shirt is torn and bloodied. He says men from Idlib had broken into his apartment.",
      "\"Some of them were civilians, some wore military clothes and were masked,\" he says. \"They hit my daughter and aimed weapons at my son's head. They stole money, they stole gold.\"",
      "Every call-out here is a show of force, especially with so many armed groups in the city. With the man's son directing them, the HTS security force drives to one of the poorer neighbourhoods, weaving through a warren of back streets, past scrapyards and middens.",
      "The armed police take up positions along the street and at the doorway of the apartment. They bring two suspects back to the station for questioning.",
      "But they barely have time to clear their weapons when there is another complaint, a dispute over gas bottles that left another man beaten.",
      "He says three men had pulled guns on him.",
      "Another race in the cars to a crowded commercial and residential neighbourhood. When the police pull a suspect out into the street - his face still bloody from the earlier fight - local women come to their balconies and shout \"Shabiha! Shabiha!\". They are accusing the suspect of being a member of the shadowy militia force, mostly made of Alawite men, who did the Assad regime's dirty work.",
      "Since its lightning-fast sweep to victory across Syria, Islamist HTS has pledged to keep the peace and protect all of the country's minorities. And every day Abu Ayoub has to make good on that pledge.",
      "\"Some infiltrators into the revolution, some saboteurs, and some weak-minded people are taking advantage of the situation in the areas that were recently liberated,\" he says.",
      "Abu Ayoub admits the situation in the city was \"a bit chaotic\" but turns his attention to Noor. \"We are here now, we weren't here when the army left. We were initially in Damascus and then we came. They are thugs, and we will evict them from your house. We will return your belongings. You have my word,\" he said. And with that he orders his men into their pickup trucks and with sirens blaring they head for the apartment.",
      "Latakia is a city liberated. Last Friday, tens of thousands of people from all sects, gathered on the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Assad dynasty. In a city square, they sat atop the plinth where the statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father - who ruled for 29 years before his death in 2000 - once stood, and joyfully waved the flag of a free Syria.",
      "The message that day was unity, of one Syria, without sectarian division. But after half a century of tyrannical rule from a regime which fanned sectarian hatred and warned that Alawites would be massacred if they ever lost power, it is an adjustment to say the least.",
      "On Saturday, three HTS fighters were killed, and 14 injured outside the city, in what it said was gun battle with a criminal gang. HTS, which is trying to maintain calm, claims there was no sectarian element to the attack.",
      "On the way to Noor's apartment, the HTS convoy speed through the streets and passersby cheer them and flash the peace sign.",
      "The new Syrian flag, with its green instead of red stripe, and three red stars instead of two green, is commonplace on shop shutters and hanging from balconies. But in Alawite areas, people mostly watch in silence as the convoy moves along. There are fewer new flags in evidence.",
      "Azam al-Ali, 28, an HTS security officer from Deir al-Sour in eastern Syria sits in the front seat. After so much oppression, he says, it will take time for people to trust authority again.",
      "\"Most of the oppressed that come with complaints are from two sects, the Sunni and the Alawite. We do not differentiate. But the extreme poverty that this regime left behind caused this vast chaos,\" he tells me as the traffic parts for the convoy.",
      "And he notes that Alawites, some of whom were among the poorest in Syria, suffered too under the Assad regime.",
      "We arrive at Noor's apartment and half a dozen armed HTS men hurry up the stairs.",
      "The woman behind the door refuses to open up, but after some negotiation the door opens, and she and her family are ordered to leave. Noor goes in to retrieve some clothes and books for her daughter who is studying for exams. Weapons and ammunition belonging to the rebel squatters are confiscated.",
      "\"When I went to HTS today I was terrified,\" says Noor. \"Their appearance was so intimidating and frightening. Honestly, though, they were very nice.\"",
      "But she won't be returning to the apartment. One nightmare has ended in Syria, and for Alawites, another has begun, she says.",
      "As she clutches her belongings, Noor says she no longer feels safe in her home.",
      "\"It's impossible for me to live here again. I do have hope, but not in the near future. At the moment I don't dare.\""

    "story": [
      "Over the last three decades, at least 565 children in the Indian state of West Bengal have been injured or killed by home-made bombs, a BBC Eye investigation has found.",
      "So what are these deadly devices and how are they linked to political violence in West Bengal? And why are so many Bengali children paying the price?",
      "On a bright summer morning in May 1996, six boys from a slum in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, stepped out to play cricket in a narrow alley.",
      "Their shantytown, nestled in the middle-class neighbourhood of Jodhpur Park, thrummed with life. It was a holiday - voting day in a general election.",
      "Nine-year-old Puchu Sardar, one of the boys, grabbed a cricket bat and quietly slipped past his sleeping father. Soon, the cracking noise of bat meeting ball echoed through the alley.",
      "A ball batted out of the boundaries of their makeshift pitch sent the boys searching for it in a small garden nearby. There, in a black plastic bag, they found six round objects.",
      "They looked like cricket balls someone had left behind, and the boys returned to the game with their spoils.",
      "One of the \"balls\" from the bag was bowled at Puchu who struck it with his bat.",
      "A deafening explosion tore through the alley. It was a bomb.",
      "As the smoke lifted and neighbours rushed outside, they found Puchu and five of his friends sprawled on the street, their skin blackened, clothes scorched, bodies torn.",
      "Screams pierced the chaos.",
      "Seven-year-old Raju Das, an orphan raised by his aunt, and seven-year-old Gopal Biswas died of their injuries. Four other boys were wounded.",
      "Puchu narrowly survived, having suffered serious burns and shrapnel wounds to his chest, face and abdomen.",
      "He spent over a month in hospital. When he came home he had to use kitchen tongs to remove shrapnel still lodged in his body because his family had run out of money to pay for any more medical care.",
      "Puchu and his friends are part of a long, tragic list of children killed or maimed by crude bombs, which have been used in West Bengal for decades in a bloody battle for dominance in the state's violent politics.",
      "There are no publicly-available figures on the number of casualties in West Bengal.",
      "So the BBC World Service went through every edition of two prominent state newspapers - Anandabazar Patrika and Bartaman Patrika - from 1996 to 2024, looking for reports of children injured or killed by these devices.",
      "We found at least 565 child casualties - 94 deaths and 471 injuries - as of 10 November. This means a child has fallen victim to bomb violence, on average, every 18 days.",
      "However, the BBC has found incidents in which children were wounded by these bombs that were not reported by the two newspapers, so the real number of casualties is likely to be higher.",
      "More than 60% of these incidents involved children playing outdoors - gardens, streets, farms, even near schools - where bombs, typically used during elections to terrorise opponents, were hidden.",
      "Most victims the BBC spoke to were poor, the children of house-help, odd-jobbers, or farm workers.",
      "The revolutionary history of bombs in West Bengal",
      "West Bengal, India's fourth-largest state with a population of more than 100 million, has long struggled with political violence.",
      "Over the years, since India's independence in 1947, the state has cycled through different rulers - the Congress party for two decades, the Communist-led Left Front for three, and the current Trinamool Congress since 2011.",
      "In the late 1960s, the state was wracked by armed conflict between Maoist rebels \u2013 also called Naxalites \u2013 and government forces.",
      "A common thread across all governments and rebel conflicts since then has been the use of bombs as tools of intimidation by political parties to silence opponents, especially during elections.",
      "\"Bombs have been [used to settle scores]. This has been happening in Bengal for a long time, more than 100 years,\" Pankaj Dutta, a former Inspector General of West Bengal police, told us.",
      "Bomb-making in Bengal has its roots in the rebellion against British rule in the early 1900s.",
      "Early efforts were crude and accidents were common: One rebel lost a hand and another died testing a bomb.",
      "Then a rebel returned from France armed with bomb-making skills.",
      "His book bomb - a legal tome loaded with explosives hidden in a Cadbury cocoa tin - would have killed its target, a British magistrate, if he had opened it.",
      "The first explosion rocked Midnapore district in 1907, when revolutionaries derailed a train carrying a senior British official by planting a bomb on the tracks.",
      "A few months later, a botched attempt to kill a magistrate in Muzaffarpur with a bomb hurled into a horse-drawn carriage claimed the lives of two Englishwomen.",
      "The act, described by a newspaper as a \"tremendous explosion that startled the town,\" had turned a teenage rebel called Khudiram Bose into a martyr and the first \"freedom fighter\" in the pantheon of Indian revolutionaries.",
      "Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a nationalist leader, wrote in 1908 that bombs were not just weapons but a new kind of \"magical lore,\" a \"witchcraft\" spreading from Bengal to the rest of India.",
      "Today, Bengal's crude bombs are known locally as\u202fpeto. They are bound with jute strings and stuffed with shrapnel-like nails, nuts and glass.",
      "Variations include explosives packed into steel containers or glass bottles. They are used primarily in violent clashes between rival political parties.",
      "Political activists, particularly in rural areas, use these bombs to intimidate opponents, disrupt voting stations, or retaliate against perceived enemies.",
      "They are often deployed during elections to sabotage polling booths or to assert control over areas.",
      "Children like Poulami Halder bear the brunt of such violence.",
      "On an April morning in 2018, the-then seven-year-old was picking flowers for morning prayers in Gopalpur, a village in the North 24 Parganas district dotted with ponds, paddy fields, and coconut trees. Village council elections were barely a month away.",
      "Poulami saw a ball lying near a neighbour's water pump.",
      "\"I picked it up and brought it home,\" she recalls.",
      "As she stepped inside, her grandfather, sipping tea, froze at the sight of the object in her hand.",
      "\"He said, 'It's not a ball - it's a bomb! Throw it away!' Before I could react, it exploded in my hand.\"",
      "The blast shattered the quiet of the village. Poulami was struck in the \"eyes, face, and hands\" and fainted, as chaos erupted around her.",
      "\"I remember people running towards me, but I could see very little. I was hit everywhere.\"",
      "Villagers rushed her to the hospital.",
      "Her injuries were devastating \u2013 her left hand was amputated, and she spent nearly a month in hospital.",
      "An ordinary morning routine had turned into a nightmare, forever altering Poulami's life in a single, shattering moment.",
      "Poulami is not alone.",
      "Sabina Khatun was 10 years old when a crude bomb exploded in her hand in April 2020 in Jitpur, a village flanked by rice and jute fields in Murshidabad district.",
      "She had been taking her goat out to graze when she stumbled upon the bomb lying in the grass. Curious, she picked it up and began playing with it.",
      "Moments later, it detonated in her hands.",
      "\"The moment I heard the explosion, I thought, who's going to be disabled this time? Has Sabina been maimed?,\" her mother, Ameena Bibi, says, her voice heavy with anguish.",

      "Maimed by bombs yet lucky to survive, these children have had their lives changed forever.",

      "Her family says she needs another operation to remove bomb debris from her eyes, but they cannot afford it.",
      "Puchu, now 37, was pulled out of school by his fearful parents and spent years refusing to step outside, often hiding under his bed at the slightest noise.",
      "He never picked up a cricket bat again. His childhood stolen, he's now scraping by with odd construction jobs and bears the scars of his past.",
      "But all hope is not lost.",
      "Poulami and Sabina have both learned to ride a bicycle with one hand and continue to go to school. Both dream of becoming teachers. Puchu hopes for a brighter future for his son, Rudra, five, -  a future in uniform as a policeman.",
      "Despite the terrible toll it inflicts, there is no sign of crude bomb violence in West Bengal ending.",
      "None of the political parties admit to using bombs for political gain.",
      "When the BBC asked the four main political parties in West Bengal whether they were involved, directly or through intermediaries, in manufacturing or using crude bombs, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not respond.",
      "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) strongly denied being involved, saying it was \"committed to upholding the rule of law\u2026and that when it comes to protecting rights and lives, children are of the utmost concern\".",
      "The Indian National Congress (INC) also strongly denied using crude bombs for electoral advantage, and said it had \"never engaged in any violence for political or personal gain\".",
      "Although no political party will admit responsibility, none of the experts who spoke to the BBC is in any doubt this carnage is rooted in Bengal's culture of political violence.",
      "\"During any major election here you will see the rampant use of bombs,\" Pankaj Dutta told us. \"Extreme abuse of childhood is going on. It is a lack of care on the part of the society.\" Mr Dutta passed away in November.",
      "Poulami adds: \"Those who planted the bombs are still free. No one should leave bombs lying around. No child should ever be harmed like this again.\"",
      "'Look what they have done to my son'",
      "But the tragedy continues.",
      "In May this year in the Hooghly district, three boys playing near a pond unknowingly stumbled upon a cache of bombs. The explosion killed Raj Biswas, nine, and left his friend maimed, missing an arm. The other boy escaped with leg fractures.",
      "\"Look what they have done to my son,\" Raj's grieving father sobbed as he caressed the forehead of his dead child.",
      "As Raj's body was lowered into a grave, political slogans crackled through the air from a nearby election rally: \"Hail Bengal!\" the crowd chanted, \"Hail Bengal!\"",
      "It was election time. And once again, children were paying the price."

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:43:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Inside the infamous prison's corridors it becomes clear how hard it will be to mend the Syria that Assad broke.",
    "story": [
      "Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.",
      "In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.",
      "As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.",
      "One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women \u2013 as well as children \u2013 who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag.",
      "Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.",
      "But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.",
      "The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution.",
      "I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.",
      "Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited.",
      "When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.",
      "In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates.",
      "In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away.",
      "The record",
      "One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.",
      "Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.",
      "The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future.",
      "A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.",
      "Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing.",
      "\"Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me\" Safana told me. \"It is very chaotic... Where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos?\"",
      "It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence.",
      "The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks.",
      "\"What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel?",
      "\"It's terrible\u2026 terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives.\"",
      "Justice, or revenge?",
      "It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.",
      "A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.",
      "When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home.",
      "Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible.",
      "At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes.",
      "A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated.",
      "One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya.",
      "\"It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering.\"",
      "Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014.",
      "\"We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me.\"",
      "Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.",
      "Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed.",
      "One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates.",
      "\"We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next.\"",
      "His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true.",
      "Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad.",
      "\"Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account.\"",
      "\"Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured.\"",
      "Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: \"Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\"",
      "Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished.",
      "Corruption",
      "The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds.",
      "Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out.",
      "Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.",
      "His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (\u00a339,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000.",
      "After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke.",
      "Hassan was overjoyed to get home.",
      "\"When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood.\"",
      "But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds.",
      "\"They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this.",
      "\"We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us.\"",
      "The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands.",
      "The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.",
      "Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress.",

    "story": [
      "A man from Ghana has told the BBC how he was seized at gunpoint by jihadists in neighbouring Burkina Faso, before being taken to their vast desert camp where he gained a rare insight into their lives - from the children he believed were trained as suicide bombers, to the tunnels they had dug to shield themselves and their armoured tanks from air strikes.",
      "In his first media interview since his 2019 ordeal, the man - whom we are calling James to protect his identity - said his first day at the camp was terrifying as a huge number of Islamist fighters returned from an operation, firing shots in the air.",
      "\"I thought that was the end. I was just sweating,\" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns - and laughed.",
      "James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.",
      "\"The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles]. So he asked me which of them I could operate, and I said I had never operated one before. He said: 'We have bigger weapons, so if I give you a battalion to handle, no-one can harm you',\" James added.",
      "He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana - a promise he says he never kept.",
      "Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.",
      "\"I met him in an attempt to sensitise tertiary-level students,\" said Mawuli Agbenu, the commission's regional director in the capital, Accra.",
      "\"We will definitely have a way of engaging with him so that he will be an ambassador or an influencer within his community,\" Mr Agbenu added.",
      "Long a stable democracy, Ghana has so far been spared the violence that has seen the insurgency spread, causing havoc in Burkina Faso and its West African neighbours.",
      "The insurgents who kidnapped James belonged to Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), or The Support Group for Islam and Muslims. An affiliate of al-Qaeda, it was officially launched in 2017 as an umbrella body for various jihadist groups in the region.",
      "In Burkina Faso, they are strongest in the north, where they control large areas, but they have also expanded to the south, along the porous 550km-long (340 mile) border with Ghana.",
      "More than 15,000 people from Burkina Faso have fled into northern Ghana to escape the conflict, aid agencies say.",
      "Apart from Burkina Faso, the jihadists have also gained territory in Niger and Mali, and have carried out attacks in Ivory Coast,  Benin and Togo - all former French colonies - raising fears that the insurgency was spreading south towards the coast.",
      "In April, a senior UN official said that \"the epicentre of terrorism has shifted from the Middle East and North Africa into sub-Saharan Africa, concentrated largely in the Sahel region [which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger]\".",
      "Jihadists linked to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group operate in the region.",
      "A Ghanaian security officer stationed along the border with Burkina Faso told the BBC that the jihadists often crossed over to regroup when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military - and they also used the country to smuggle weapons, food and fuel.",
      "\"It\u2019s not safe for Ghana. They hide in towns like Pusiga. Residents of border communities are worried because there\u2019s no tight security,\" he added.",
      "In a report released in July, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank said the \"absence of real attacks on Ghanaian soil seems to result from JNIM's calculus of not disturbing supply lines and places of rest as well as not provoking a relatively strong army\".",
      "\"Examples of people who are spared by JNIM by showing their Ghanaian identity cards fits this reading,\" it added.",
      "Most Ghanaians are Christians, but the population near the border with Burkina Faso is mainly Muslim - and parts of the region have also been riven with ethnic tensions, raising fears that the jihadists could exploit them to their advantage.",
      "The think-tank said that JNIM had attempted in a \"very small number\" of instances to recruit or incite Ghana's small, largely Muslim Fulani community to carry out attacks.",
      "JNIM claimed that they were marginalised, but its recruitment efforts had \"minimal success\" as the Fulani were \"aware of the chaos that has enveloped the Sahel due to familial networks\" and did not want it to occur in Ghana, the think-tank added.",
      "A Fulani Muslim preacher in Burkina Faso, Amadou Koufa, is the co-founder of JNIM and is its second-in-command. He recruits most of his fighters from the Fulani community in Burkina Faso.",
      "The military has been accused by rights groups of retaliating by stigmatising Fulanis, and carrying out indiscriminate attacks on their villages in Burkina Faso.",
      "In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.",
      "Although some were operating in insurgency-hit countries like Burkina Faso, others had been sent back to their villages in northern Ghana to preach their \"radical faith\", it added.",
      "This could eventually lead to the jihadists gaining \"a sustainable foothold in remote and peripheral areas in the north\", the NGO said.",
      "Since 2022, Ghana has been at the forefront of efforts to create a new Western-backed, 10,000-strong regional force to combat the Islamist insurgency.",
      "Tamale - the biggest city in northern Ghana - is supposed to be the force's headquarters.",
      "However, the headquarters has not yet opened, and the fate of the initiative is unclear after the region split between pro-Western and pro-Russian states.",
      "Burkina Faso - along with Mali and Niger - have pivoted towards Russia. The three countries have formed their own alliance to fight the insurgents, and have also relied on help from Russian mercenaries.",
      "Ghana and other regional states have remained allied with the West.",
      "Ghana's military has established bases in the north, but newly installed border surveillance equipment was not yet working, the security officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC.",
      "However, more troops have been sent since JNIM carried out two attacks, late last month and earlier this month, on the Burkina Faso side of the border, the officer added.",
      "Ghana's government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "However, its ambassador to Burkina Faso, Boniface Gambila Adagbila, told the BBC the two countries were helping each other to fight the insurgents, warning that if Burkina Faso fails \"Ghana may likely to be the next place\".",
      "Ghana's National Democratic Congress (NDC) party - which will form the next government after winning elections on 7 December - promised in its campaign manifesto to \"enhance\" border security with \"international partners\", as well as improve the country's intelligence capabilities.",
      "In August 2023, the European Union announced that as part of a 20m euro ($21.6m; \u00a316.6m) aid package it would supply Ghana with about 100 armoured vehicles, as well as surveillance equipment such as drones.",
      "Many civilians and refugees cross the Ghana-Burkina Faso border through footpaths and back roads to work, trade or visit relatives despite the security risk - and James said he was one of them. He was travelling all the way to Senegal on his motorbike when he was taken captive.",
      "After riding for nearly a day, he said he encountered the insurgents in north-western Burkina Faso, as he was nearing the border with Mali.",
      "A handful of jihadists, also on motorbikes, stopped him and took him to their camp where he was interrogated until their commander was convinced that he was not a spy, James said.",
      "He added that his blindfold - the trademark black jihadist flag - was then removed.",
      "James said he found about 500 insurgents - mostly young men, including one who identified himself as a doctor - living in the camp.",
      "Located in desert-like terrain, it was made up of thatch-roofed huts, with small electricity-generating solar panels, he said.",
      "He added that the camp was divided into three sections - for commanders and their families, lower-ranking jihadists and captured villagers and soldiers.",
      "James said he was detained in the latter section, but got \"closer\" to the jihadists in the second week as he increasingly acted as though he had become a sympathiser of their cause.",
      "They sat around in groups of five or 10, and listened to the songs of Salif Ke\u00efta, the Malian musician known as the Golden Voice of Africa, James said.",
      "Other jihadist groups have banned music, saying it is un-Islamic.",
      "James said that while the atmosphere at the camp was generally relaxed, groups of jihadists regularly went to fight, firing celebratory shots when they returned, claiming to have achieved battlefield success.",
      "James said he realised that this was the gunfire he had heard on the first day, and got used to it.",
      "He added that the insurgents parked their tanks and pick-up trucks in two inter-connected tunnels to ensure they were not destroyed if there was an air strike, while only a few vehicles remained outside \"on stand-by, for an emergency\".",
      "He said the jihadists also revealed their darkest sides - telling him they captured women during raids on villages and sold them to each other.",
      "\"They trade the women they\u2019ve captured. Others sell wives that they are fed up with. Those who resist are gang-raped into submission by two or three fighters,\" James added, though he did not see them do this.",
      "James said the women at the camp included the wives of jihadists who performed domestic chores like cooking and cleaning, while those who were captured were either sex-slaves or were forced to become fighters.",
      "He explained that he saw fully veiled women, with AK-47 rifles hidden under their clothes, leave the camp to raid villages for livestock to feed people at the camp - or to sell at markets in nearby towns.",
      "James said he also saw dozens of children, including those of jihadists, being trained in the use of weapons and explosives.",
      "\"You'll see a small kid holding a gun and telling you that if he goes to meet some people, this is how he is going to kill them,\" James added.",
      "He said he twice saw four children being taken to another location, before returning to the camp with suicide vests.",
      "They wore long, loose outfits over them, and left the camp with begging bowls, James said.",
      "Jihadists told him that when they anticipate a tough battle in a town or military camp, they send children disguised as beggars who then blow themselves up, so the fighters can enter amid the chaos, James said.",
      "He added that three jihadists had told him that they \"sacrifice their children as suicide bombers and they get paid after every mission\", though they did not disclose the amount.",
      "He said the jihadists tried to indoctrinate him, preaching that \"anything Western is evil\" and showing him propaganda videos every night, including one of the US invasion of Iraq and the killing of Palestinians in the current conflict with Israel.",
      "According to James, as the insurgency was being waged in French-speaking countries, all the jihadists were Francophone, but one spoke English with a Ghanaian accent, and always kept his face covered so that he could not see him.",
      "In a sign that the jihadists were also influenced by pan-Africanism, James said some of them invoked the names of revolutionaries like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and told him that people should \"rise up\" against \"bad leaders\" and free themselves from \"bondage\".",
      "James said the jihadists also expressed the view that if Sankara and Nkrumah had \"lived long\",  then \"the whole of Africa would have been a better place - nobody would have travelled from Africa to the West. People would have been travelling from the West to Africa\".",
      "James, unemployed at the time, said their rhetoric was powerful, and only \"strength of heart\" prevented him from joining their ranks.",
      "On how exactly he was captured, James said that two Muslim friends were travelling with him at the time, promising to introduce him to a Muslim spiritual leader in Senegal who could pray for him and improve his fortunes.",
      "All three of them were intercepted by the jihadists as they were coming to the end of the first leg of their trip, he said.",
      "James added one of his friends was shot dead as he attempted to flee, while his other friend was taken with him to the camp.",
      "James said the commander did not release his friend, making him fear that he had been forced to join the jihadists - or was dead.",
      "\"The commander told me that: 'I will let you go if you assure me you will get me more fighters',\" James said.",
      "He added that before driving him to a bus rank and giving him the fare for the trip back home, the insurgents gave him a contact number to keep in touch, but, James said, he never did and changed his number.",
      "According to James, the jihadists also gave him charms, which supposedly had supernatural powers.",
      "Again, many other jihadists reject the use of amulets, believing them to be contrary to the teachings of Islam.",
      "James showed the BBC the amulets, which were made of fowl feathers, animal skins and herbs, covered in leather and cloth.",
      "They included one which the jihadists falsely told him offered protection from bullets.",
      "James said he never got the impression that the insurgents wanted to destabilise Ghana, seeing it as the \"safest place\" to hide when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military.",
      "Their focus was on waging an insurgency in countries where France and the US \"exists\", believing that these two countries exploit Africa's resources, to the detriment of its people, James said. This is denied by both countries.",
      "Ghana-based security analyst Adib Saani expressed concern about the growing insurgency in West Africa, and said he did not see a military solution to it.",
      "\u201cWe need to go beyond the militarised posture. We must address the socio-economic and geopolitical deficits that are creating the environment for terrorism to strive,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Ghana's National Commission for Civic Education has been carrying out a public awareness campaign dubbed \"see something, say something\" to encourage residents in the north to report suspicious activity.",
      "The campaign has also been extended to Accra, to educate young people about the dangers of jihadism.",
      "The commission's Mr Agbanu told the BBC that the campaign was vital as Ghanaians were vulnerable to recruitment.",
      "\"There\u2019s a high rate of corruption, unequal development across the country, and huge youth unemployment,\" he said.",
      "James, who is now a subsistence farmer, said that he was just relieved to be alive as the jihadist commander had told him that he was making an exception by releasing him because normally it was \"either your dead body that will go home or nobody will ever hear of you again\".",

    "summary": "Thanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.",
    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:10:32 GMT",
    "summary": "India, the world's most populous country, is seeing a debate about having more babies.",
    "story": [
      "Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates.",
      "With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up.",
      "Leaders of two southern states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu \u2013 have recently advocated more children.",
      "Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises.",
      "India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.",
      "Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.)",
      "The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s.",
      "Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries.",
      "But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.",
      "\"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC.",
      "Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976.",
      "This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom.",
      "Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation.",
      "Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.",
      "\"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\"",
      "The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli.",
      "This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves.",
      "But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.",
      "The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?",
      "Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report.",
      "In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\".",
      "Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift.",
      "Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.",
      "While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli.",
      "As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting.",
      "While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\".",
      "A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".",
      "\"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "This is already happening in some countries.",
      "In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.",
      "But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "WATCH: Why do some in India want couples to have more children?",
      "For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations.",
      "Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\".",
      "India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says.",

      "But traditional burials can pollute too. Non-biodegradable coffins are often made with harmful chemicals and bodies are embalmed using formaldehyde: a toxic substance which can leach into soil.",
      "In a recent survey from Co-op Funeralcare, conducted by YouGov, one person in 10 said they would want a more 'eco-friendly' funeral.",
      "Rachel, from Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, made a burial shroud for a friend from locally-sourced wool, willow, bramble and ivy, as part of her work as an artist.",
      "For years she has explored the themes of death, dying, grief and nature through crafts and functional objects.",
      "But the 50-year-old sees the shroud, which can also remove the need for a coffin, as more than just artwork - and has since decided to make her own.",
      "A common reaction from those who have seen the creation is to ask if they can touch it, to feel how soft it is.",
      "For Rachel, it is the perfect way of helping people address the taboo topic of death.",
      "She also works as a death doula, which involves supporting people who are dying, as well as their loved ones, to make informed funeral care choices.",
      "\"I find that when we talk about death, everybody I've met finds it a helpful and healthy thing, and something that is life-enriching,\" she says.",

      "When Rachel's time comes, she wants a natural burial, which means using a biodegradable coffin or shroud in a shallower grave. The upper layers of soil contain more active microbes, so bodies can decompose in about 20 to 30 years, rather than up to 100 in a traditional grave.",
      "Natural burial grounds are dotted across the UK and bear little resemblance to normal cemeteries \u2013 trees and wildflowers replace man-made grave markings, and no pesticides are used.",

      "\u201cMore and more people are asking about it and want to make choices that are better for the planet. They often feel it reflects the life of the person who has died because it was important to them,\" she says.",
      "As with many eco-friendly industries, natural burials can cost more. Many grounds, including Tarn Moor, offer cheaper plots to locals. One in Speeton, North Yorkshire, is community-run and puts profits back into the village playground.",
      "At Tarn Moor, a plot plus maintenance for Skipton residents costs \u00a31,177. Non-locals are charged \u00a31,818. The nearest council cemetery charges \u00a31,200 for a grave while cremation costs here start at \u00a3896.",

      "Two military vehicles and several soldiers in full combat gear man an impromptu checkpoint \u2013 a foreign authority in a country celebrating its freedom. They waved us through.",
      "It was evidence of Israel's incursion into Syrian territory \u2013 the temporary seizure, it said, of a UN-monitored buffer zone, set up in a ceasefire agreement 50 years ago.",
      "\"Maybe they'll leave, maybe they'll stay, maybe they'll make the area safe then go away,\" said Riyad Zaidan, who lives in Hadar. \"We want to hope, but we'll have to wait and see.\"",
      "The village chief, Jawdat al-Tawil, pointed to the Golan Heights territory Israel occupied in 1967, clearly visible from Hadar's terraces.",
      "Many residents here have relatives still living there.",
      "Now, they see Israeli forces routinely moving around their own village, parts of which jut into the demilitarized zone. On a slope above, Israeli bulldozers can be seen working on the hillside.",
      "A week after President Assad's regime fell, the sense of freedom here comes tinged with fatalism.",
      "Jawdat al-Tawil told me proudly how the village had defended itself against militia groups during the Syrian civil war, and showed me portraits of the dozens of men who had died doing so.",
      "\"We don't allow anyone to transgress on our land,\" he said. \"[But] Israel is a state \u2013 we can't stand against it. We used to stand up to individuals, but Israel is a super-power.\"",
      "Since the fall of Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Israel has also carried out hundreds of airstrikes on military targets across Syria.",
      "And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced new plans to double the population of Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, saying the move was needed because of \"the new front\" that had opened up in Syria.",
      "Speaking before that plan was unveiled, Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa warned Israel's military manoeuvres risked unwarranted escalation in the region and said his administration did not want conflict with Israel.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry said its actions were necessary because of threats posed by jihadist groups operating along the ceasefire line with Syria, describing its military incursions there as \"limited and temporary\".",
      "The residents of Hadar belong mainly to the Druze community \u2013 a tight-knit, introverted group which splintered from mainstream Shia Islam centuries ago.",
      "When Israel occupied part of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, and later unilaterally annexed it, some of the Druze there opted to remain and take Israeli citizenship.",
      "Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Syrian militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that forced President Assad from power this month, has his family roots in the occupied Golan Heights.",
      "Some here on the Syrian-controlled side fear Israel's plan is to grab more territory for itself.",
      "For years, Israel has been battling the Iran-backed militia there that supported Assad. This border region is a key weapons-supply route between Tehran and the proxy forces it maintains, including the Lebanese militia Hezbollah.",
      "Assad's fall has left those groups \u2013 and Iran \u2013 weaker. But Israel has since stepped up its military campaign, taking advantage of the political vacuum to extend its reach.",
      "It has also been targeting military equipment left by Assad's forces at bases across the country, worried about who might end up using it in the future.",
      "Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that the \"immediate risks\" to Israel remained, and the recent developments in Syria had increased the threat, \"despite the moderate appearance that rebel leaders claim to present\".",
      "Marginalised by the Assad regime, and targeted as infidels by Sunni jihadist groups like HTS, Syria's Druze are more tolerant of Israel than many other communities here.",
      "The village used to fight against the Iran-backed groups Israel sees as a threat here, but Jawdat al-Tawil told me that alliances in the area were shifting, and that he was now talking to these groups about reaching a deal.",
      "Syria is not a place where people have relied on only one ally, or fight only one enemy.",
      "\"We just need peace,\" resident Riyad Zaidan told me. \"We've had enough war, enough blood, enough hard life \u2013 we need to stop.\"",
      "Religious minorities like the Druze suffered under Assad. The country's new leaders from HTS have promised tolerance and respect for Syria's diverse ethnic and religious groups.",
      "But eight years ago the group was still aligned with global jihadist groups like al-Qaeda.",
      "It was around the time HTS split from al-Qaeda in 2016 that Jawdat al-Tawil's son, Abdo, was killed by their militiamen on the outskirts of Hadar, while fighting for the Syrian Army.",
      "He showed me the path where 30-year-old Abdo died and I asked how he felt about HTS taking control of Syria now.",
      "\"At first, they were gangs. Now they have got rid of the tyrant [Assad], and have come to power,\" he said. \"They're supposed to rule with justice, provide safety and ensure people's rights.\"",
      "\"It's not clear yet if they've changed,\" he said. \"I hope so.\"",

      "All gave similar accounts of years of mistreatment and torture at the hands of guards, executions of fellow inmates, corruption by prison officials, and forced confessions.",

      "The prisoners we spoke to say they were sent to Saydnaya because of real or perceived links with the rebel Free Syrian Army, their opposition to Assad, or simply because they lived in an area known to oppose him.",
      "Some had been accused of kidnapping and killing regime soldiers and convicted of terrorism.",

      "They were then taken to the prison's main cells, where the rooms have no beds, a single lightbulb and a small toilet area in the corner.",
      "When we visited the prison this week, we saw blankets, clothes and food strewn on the floors of cells.",

      "Finding scratch marks on a cell wall that he believes he made, he knelt down and began to cry.",

      "He bares his broken teeth, saying they were knocked out when he was hit in the mouth by a guard with a stick.",

      "Families sent loved ones money for food in the prison but they say corrupt officials would keep much of it and give the inmates only limited rations.",
      "In some of the cells, inmates would pool all of the food together. But it wasn't enough.",
      "Adnan found the hunger even harder than the beatings. \"I would go to sleep and wake up hungry,\" he says.",
      "\"There was a punishment that we received one month where one day they would pass us a slice of bread, the next day half a slice, until it was a tiny crumb. Then it was nothing. We got no bread.\"",
      "Qasem says one day guards covered the face of his cell's de-facto leader with yoghurt and made others lick it off.",
      "The men said the behaviour of guards was as much about inflicting humiliation as pain.",
      "All described losing significant amounts of weight in the prison because of malnourishment.",
      "\"My biggest dream was to eat and be full,\" Qasem says.",
      "His family paid officers bribes for visitation rights. He would sometimes be brought down on a wheelchair because he was too weak to walk, his father says.",
      "Diseases were rife and the inmates had no way of stopping them from spreading.",
      "Two of the men we spoke to who were released on Sunday say they had contracted tuberculosis in Saydnaya - one said medication was frequently withheld as a form of punishment.",
      "But Adnan says the \"diseases from fear\" were even worse than the physical ones.",
      "At a hospital in Damascus this week, an official said brief medical checks of the detainees that were sent there had found \"mainly psychological problems\".",
      "These accounts paint a picture of a place with no hope, only pain.",
      "The prisoners spent much of their time in silence with no access to the outside world, so it is no surprise that they say they knew nothing of the rebel Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's (HTS) rapid advance in Syria until they were broken free that morning.",
      "Qasem said they could hear what sounded like a helicopter taking off from the prison grounds before the men's shouts in the corridors. But in the windowless cell they couldn't be sure.",
      "Then the doors opened, and the freed inmates began running as fast as they could.",
      "\"We ran out of the prison. We ran from fear too,\" Rakan says, his thoughts on his young children and wife.",

      "He says he will never go back to Saydnaya again.",
      "Adnan, too, says he couldn't look back at the prison, as he ran crying towards Damascus.",
      "\"I just kept going. I can't describe it. I just headed for Damascus. People were taking us from the road in their cars.\"",
      "He now fears each night when he goes to sleep that he will wake in the prison, and find it was all a dream.",
      "Qasem ran to a town called Tal Mneen. It was there that a woman who provided the freed prisoners with food, money and clothing told them: \"Assad has fallen\".",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "Once out of hospital, she was almost immediately being bombarded with unsolicited advice.",
      "There was \u201ctoo much talk, too much control around how I should raise the child. In a way that also affected my mind. It made me feel like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I wasn\u2019t given the chance to be a mother.\u201d",

      "Swedish clothing brand Djerf Avenue is facing a backlash from fans following claims of bullying and body-shaming against its founder Matilda Djerf.",
      "An investigation by Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet reported that 11 current and former employees described being belittled, called names and yelled at in the workplace.",
      "Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was \"deeply sorry\" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.",
      "But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to \"never purchase anything or voice support again\".",
      "'Performative and spineless'",
      "Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.",
      "Djerf Avenue's website promotes a world \"filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,\" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.",
      "Sumi told the BBC: \"It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.\"",
      "Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (\u00a327.5m) in revenue last year.",
      "It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened.",
      "'Betrayal of values'",
      "Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.",
      "\"Djerf Avenue has always marketed itself as a body-positive, inclusive and empowering brand, so hearing allegations of body-shaming and a toxic work environment felt like a complete betrayal of the values they claim to uphold,\" she said.",

      "It was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said Talia Jane, a journalist who was there.",
      "But it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 December, fuelled by latent anger directed at America's private health insurers.",
      "\"There was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,\" Ms Jane said.",

      "In TikTok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a New York City sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.",
      "This fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.",
      "\"We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,\" said Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's.",
      "\"In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice.\"",
      "Almost immediately after Mr Thompson was shot dead, the internet began to lionise his suspected killer. On TikTok, people posted videos of a \"CEO assassin\" New York City walking tour. On Spotify, playlists dedicated to the suspect started to appear.",
      "Once Mr Mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.",
      "The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.",
      "Etsy was flooded with pro-Mangione apparel, while Amazon pulled similar products from their site.",
      "The McDonald's worker alleged to have turned him in has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.",
      "The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.",
      "Much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the \"hot assassin\".",
      "Indeed, Mr Mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton.",
      "Americans are effectively \"programmed\" to trust and empathise with men who look like Mr Mangione, he said.",
      "\"That's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.\"",
      "Public adoration for handsome men accused of crimes is not new - from Ted Bundy to Jeremy Meeks, violent men have developed cult followings.",
      "But Professor Tanya Horeck, an expert on digital culture and true crime from Anglia Ruskin University, says that social media has given those sentiments massive visibility, and helped them spread.",
      "The internet has caused \"a blurring of the lines between celebrity and criminality\", she told the BBC, adding that when people see a good-looking person pop into their feeds, their first thought is lust, not moral criticism.",
      "\"The mood around Luigi Mangione is 'thirst',\" she said.",
      "Beyond his appearance, a large part of Mr Mangione's online appeal is clearly his apparent ire against the private healthcare industry and corporate elites in general. US media has reported that Mr Mangione was arrested carrying a handwritten document that said \"these parasites had it coming\".",
      "The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit extremism research group based in New Jersey, said that after the shooting the hashtag #EatTheRich went viral.",
      "Since Mr Mangione's arrest, variations of \"#FreeLuigi\" were posted on X over 50,000 times, likely getting tens of millions of impressions. And by some measures, the NCRI said, engagement with posts about Mr Thompson's killing across platforms like X, Reddit, and others surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July.",
      "An analysis of a sample of comments carried out by market research firm OneCliq found the vast majority - four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.",
      "Mr Mangione's X account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.",
      "The shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - \"wanted\" posters of other CEOs appeared around New York City, and a woman in Florida was arrested after telling an insurance agent on the phone \"Delay, Deny, Depose. You people are next,\" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.",
      "Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the NCRI, called the online reaction a \"turning point\" and \"a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes\".",
      "He compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.",
      "\"The dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, Discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,\" he said.",
      "Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at Notre Dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.",
      "\"People are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,\" he said. \"They're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect.\"",
      "Recent research by Commonwealth Fund, a health policy institute, found 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "There are indications that the shooting has prompted some introspection on the part of healthcare companies.",
      "\"I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,\" Pfizer's chief sustainability officer Caroline Roan told a conference in New York on Wednesday, according to Reuters.",
      "Some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about UHC took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.",
      "\"It's a horrific act of violence, and I absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,\" Jenn Coffey, who has been fighting to get UHC to cover her medical bills, said of Mr Thompson's killing. \"But I'm not shocked by the reaction.\"",

      "Who is Luigi Mangione, CEO shooting suspect?",
      "How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shape",
      "Ms Coffey, 53, from Manchester, New Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and later fell ill with complex regional pain syndrome, a potentially debilitating neurological condition. When a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her UHC insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. She has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group People's Action.",
      "Ms Coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. She said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.",
      "\"I get to have some normality. I can sit up and paint, or I can enjoy a meal with my family\" because of the treatment, she said. \"I can have a life that's worth living.\"",
      "UnitedHealth Group told the BBC they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.",
      "At the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, Brian Thompson, who was 50.",
      "\"It's incredibly bleak that [Thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,\" Blakely Thornton said.",
      "\"The collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy.\"",
      "In his last post on LinkedIn, Mr Thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, obtained a message that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty sent to staff this week, memorialising Mr Thompson and calling his murdered colleague \"one of the good guys\".",
      "\"He was certainly one of the smartest guys. I think he was one of the best guys. I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend,\" he wrote.",
      "In the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.",
      "\"I'm thankful to UHC and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,\" they wrote, according to the company.",
      "Another message said: \"So very sad that this world is so hateful. I have always had great experiences with UHC.\"",
      "Ms Coffey, the UHC policyholder and patient, said: \"My heart goes out to the family and I can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. It's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.\"",

    "summary": "It is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor, writes Hugh Schofield.",
    "story": [
      "President Macron has turned to a fellow centrist, and one of France's most experienced politicians, to extricate the country from its crisis of government.",
      "But if Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou commands plenty of respect across the political spectrum, it is hard to see how he can avoid the same man-traps that felled his predecessor Michel Barnier.",
      "Appointed by the president as the constitution dictates, the prime minister can nonetheless only function with the support of parliament.",
      "And as the National Assembly is crippled by the same three-bloc impasse as it has been since July - with no possible change before July 2025 - it would be a rash punter who predicted for Bayrou any degree of success.",
      "Since the fall of Barnier a week ago - after a vote of no confidence supported by left and populist right - Macron has consulted with a range of leaders in the hope of forming a new informal coalition to run the country.",
      "Barnier having been a man of the traditional right, Macron's first instinct was to turn to the traditional left - and efforts initially focused on prising the Socialist Party (PS) from its alliance with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).",
      "However as the PS's condition was the adoption of leftwing policies that Macron was unwilling to sanction,  he was forced to limit his search to his own inner circle.",
      "Bayrou has been a close ally of the president since before Macron's first stunning election win in 2017. Indeed Bayrou's decision to stand aside as a candidate that year - and rally behind the younger man - created a vital dynamic behind Macron's campaign.",
      "A well-known figure on the political stage for more than 40 years,  Bayrou - who is 73 - has run the Modem party, which now has 36 deputies, since its formation in 2007. Before that he was the leader of other centrist incarnations.",
      "His beginnings were in the Chistian Democrat tradition of post-war politics, which in general supported but kept a distance from the larger Gaullist component of the French right, led from the late 1970s by Jacques Chirac.",
      "Bayrou, who was a teacher of classical languages in his 20s, served as education minister from 1993 to 1997. But that was his last meaningful experience of government.",
      "Very briefly in 2017 he was Macron's justice minister, but stepped down after being accused in a party funding scandal.",
      "He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but many of his colleagues were convicted. And prosecutors have appealed against his acquittal, meaning he could yet be brought back to court.",
      "An observant Catholic with six children, Bayrou's political base is in the Pyrenean city of Pau where he has been mayor since 2014. He speaks the local Bearnese language and is a strong believer in decentralisation.",
      "Bayrou has run for the presidency three times, as standard-bearer of the centre. He was closest to victory in 2007, when he came third with nearly 19% of the vote. He then angered the future winner Nicolas Sarkozy by coming out in support of the Socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal.",
      "When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides.",
      "His backing for Royal and then Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012 has established a certain trust among the Socialists. But his views on debt - and the need to bring it down - help him on the right.",
      "Interestingly his relationship with Marine Le Pen of the populist right is also respectful. In the past he has helped her collect the sponsorships needed to run for the presidency, arguing that it would be an affront to democracy if the leader of the most popular party could not stand.",
      "Similar sentiments led to support for Le Pen, when the prosecutor in her own party funding trial (a similar case to his own) recently demanded she be declared ineligible for public office.",
      "This may mean that Bayrou can avoid an automatic censure from the populist right.",
      "But Le Pen's National Rally has also warned that if the new prime minister is \"Barnier with another face\" it will not hesitate to bring him down.",
      "According to France's veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel, Bayrou is an independent-minded and highly experienced figure who - though allied to Macron - will not hesitate to exert his power at Hotel Matignon, his official residence.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 06:07:31 GMT",
    "summary": "India's top court is hearing petitions against a1991 law that protects the character of religious places.",
    "story": [
      "India's top court is hearing a number of petitions challenging a decades-old law that preserves the character and identity of religious places as they existed at the time of the country's independence in 1947.",
      "The law, introduced in 1991, prohibits converting or altering the character of any place of worship and prevents courts from entertaining disputes over its status, with the exception of the Babri Masjid case, which was explicitly exempted.",
      "The Babri Masjid, a 16th-Century mosque, was at the heart of a long-standing dispute, culminating in its demolition by a Hindu mob in 1992. A court verdict in 2019 awarded the site to Hindus for the construction of a temple, reigniting debates over India's religious and secular fault lines.",
      "The current petitions, including one from a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), argue that the 1991 law infringes on religious freedom and constitutional secularism.",
      "The hearing comes against the backdrop of Hindu groups filing cases to challenge the status of many mosques, claiming they were built over demolished Hindu temples.",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "India mosque dispute could become a religious flashpoint",
      "Many, including opposition leaders and Muslim groups, have defended the law, saying it is crucial to safeguard the places of worship of religious minorities in a Hindu-majority India. They also question the nature of historical evidence presented by the petitioners in support of their claims.",
      "They say that if the law is struck down or diluted, it could open the floodgates for a slew of similar challenges and inflame religious tensions, especially between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court barred courts from registering fresh cases challenging the ownership of places of worship or ordering surveys to establish their character and identity until further notice. It is next set to hear the issue in February.",
      "Why was the law introduced?",
      "The law says that the religious character of any place of worship - temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras - must be maintained as it was on 15 August 1947, when Indian became independent.",
      "The Place of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 was brought in by the then-Congress party government while a movement - led by members of the Hindu nationalist BJP - to build a temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in the northern town of Ayodhya was getting stronger. The aggressive campaign triggered riots in several parts of the country and, according to some estimates, left hundreds dead.",
      "The violence was a painful reminder of the religious strife India had witnessed during partition in 1947.",
      "While introducing the bill in parliament, then home minister SB Chavan expressed anxiety about \"an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests\".",
      "These groups, he said, were resorting to \"forcible conversion\" of places of worship in an attempt to create new disputes.",
      "The BJP, then in the opposition, strongly opposed the bill, with some lawmakers walking out of parliament. An MP from the party said he believed the bill was brought in to appease the minorities and would only increase the rift between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "Apart from archaeological sites - whether religious or not - the only exception to the law was the Babri Masjid, as a legal challenge against the structure existed even before independence.",
      "Hindu mobs, however, demolished the mosque within months of the enactment of the law. In 2019, while awarding the disputed land to Hindu groups, India's Supreme Court said that the demolition of the mosque was an illegal act.",
      "Why does it keep making news?",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling on the law will be crucial to the fate of dozens of religious structures, especially those of Muslims, that are contested by Hindu groups. These include Gyanvapi and Shahi Eidgah, two disputed mosques in the holy cities of Varanasi and Mathura.",
      "Critics also point out that the historical nature of the sites will make it hard to conclusively establish divergent claims, leaving scope for bitter inter-religious battles and violence.",
      "While the hearing is being closely watched, the law also makes news whenever there is a fresh development in cases challenging mosques.",
      "Two weeks ago, a court in Rajasthan issued notices to the government after admitting a petition claiming that the revered Ajmer Sharif dargah - a 13th-Century Sufi shrine that attracts thousands of visitors every day - stood over a Hindu temple.",
      "And last month, four people were killed in Sambhal town in Uttar Pradesh state when violence broke out during a court-ordered survey of a 16th-Century mosque. Muslim groups have contested the survey in the Supreme Court.",
      "There have been tensions over other court-ordered surveys earlier, including in the case of the Gyanvapi mosque. Hindu groups said the 17th-Century mosque was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the partial ruins of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Muslim groups opposed the survey ordered by a local court, saying it violated the 1991 law.",
      "But in 2022, a Supreme Court bench headed by then chief justice DY Chandrachud did not stop the survey from going ahead. He also observed that the 1991 law did not prevent investigations into the status of a place of worship as of 15 August 1947, as long as it did not seek to alter it.",
      "Many have criticised this since then, with former civil servant Harsh Mander saying that it \"opened the floodgates for this series of orders by courts that run contrary to the 1991 law\".",
      "\"If you allow the survey of a mosque to determine if a temple lay below it, but then prohibit actions to restore a temple at that site, this is a surefire recipe for fostering resentment, hate and fear that could detonate for years in bitter feuds between people of diverse faiths,\" Mr Mander wrote.",
      "Thursday's Supreme Court order means that these surveys and ongoing court cases remain on hold for now.",

      "\"American Me\" (1992)",
      "In his first film as director, Edward James Olmos stars as a prison gang leader who, upon his release, tries to maintain his hold on criminal organizations and drug trafficking in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",
      "Once the Hays Office decided in the early 1930s that movies had become too violent and licentious, bad guys either had to make good for their crimes, or pay the ultimate price. No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",
      "\"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (a.k.a. \"Serpentine Dance \u2013 Annabelle\") (1895)",
      "This early Edison short film captures dancer Annabelle Moore maneuvering fabric-wings. Several versions of the film were released, including some with color tints.",
      "\"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984)",
      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",
      "\"Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt\" (1989)",
      "The origin of the NAMES Project Aids Memorial Quilt \u2014 a tapestry of stories memorializing those who died from HIV/AIDS, as well as a society that had failed them \u2014 is told in this Oscar-winning feature documentary, directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, that also earned a Peabody Award.",
      "\"Compensation\" (1999)",
      "The debut feature of director Zeinabu irene Davis tells two parallel love stories, set nearly a century apart, each involving a deaf woman and a hearing man diagnosed with a fatal disease. Michelle A. Banks (who is herself deaf) and John Earl Jelks play both couples, and their stories are illustrated with title cards and American Sign Language.",
      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze starred in the hit romance that earned the Jennifer Warnes-Bill Medley song \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" an Oscar and a Grammy.",
      "\"Ganja and Hess\" (1973)",
      "Duane Jones, who played the lead in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" stars in this horror story in which an anthropologist studying ancient African cultures becomes a vampire. A low-budget tale that served as a metaphor for drug addiction, \"Ganja and Hess\" was directed by writer and playwright Bill Gunn, and was later remade by Spike Lee as \"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus.\"",
      "\"Invaders from Mars\" (1953)",
      "When little David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) wakes up in the middle of the night and witnesses a spaceship landing nearby, he tries to convince his dad it was real. But when dad returns from investigating the landing site, there's something not quite right about him. And then, a similar change comes over his mother. What are those strange marks on the back of their necks? What's poor little David to do? Fifties paranoia blends with stylish photography, cool-looking sets, and ridiculous Martian costumes in this nostalgic sci-fi tale directed by William Cameron Menzies.",
      "\"KoKo's Earth Control\" (1928)",
      "A wild addition to the genre of apocalyptic cinema, this silent cartoon by Max and Dave Fleischer features Koko the Clown and his naughty dog Fitz, visiting the place that runs our planet's weather. Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",
      "\"My Family/Mi familia\" (1995)",
      "Directed by Gregory Nava (\"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez\"), this emotional and tearful multi-generational story of Mexican immigrants settling in East Los Angeles stars Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Elpidia Carrillo and Enrique Castillo.",
      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents. Starring Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as mom-and-pop spies, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as their budding young agents, the film was a hit, spawning a franchise (including a 3-D entry starring Sylvester Stallone).",
      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",
      "Cinematographer Jessie Maple directed this, the first independent feature helmed by an African American woman, in which a former athlete and coach (played by Obaka Adedunyo) struggles to overcome drug addiction.",
      "Zora Lathan Student Films (1975-1976)",
      "The democratic nature of the National Film Registry allows for the preservation of Hollywood studio features, independent films, industrial and advertising shorts, student films, and newsreels. The Registry has also preserved home movies, which capture American life in unfiltered and wholly revealing ways.\u00a0 During her years as a film student in Chicago, Adaora \"Zora\" Lathan shot six short 16mm films documenting her family members \u2014 whimsical vignettes which she characterized as \"artworks.\"",

      "When King asked what was going through her mind before stepping on stage, Jackson responded, \"I was just like, 'Wow, this is really gonna happen.' And I was going through my lines.\"",
      "Childhood dream",
      "In her memoir \"Lovely One,\" Jackson revealed her lifelong love for theater and shared her aspiration to become the first Supreme Court Justice to perform on Broadway.",
      "\"I just always loved theater. And I felt very comfortable on stage. You know, I was always performing from when I was really young. It just felt like the theater people were my people,\" Jackson said during an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" at the Civilian Hotel in New York just before her first rehearsal.",
      "\"My best friend was a girl named Sunny Schleifer, and the two of us would make up skits and dress up and do all of these things. When I got into high school, I did speech and debate. I had these two different loves, the law and theater,\" she said.",
      "Jackson's Broadway debut included two scenes written specifically for her in \"& Juliet,\" a musical that celebrates female empowerment and controlling one's own destiny. \"It's a wonderful message and obviously very fun,\" Jackson said.",
      "Before stepping onto the Broadway stage, Jackson participated in table reads, scene walkthroughs and vocal sessions, preparing for the performance.",
      "Reflecting on her early days as an aspiring actor, Jackson recalled a drama class at Harvard where she acted alongside a classmate who would later become famous: Matt Damon. \"We just were in a drama class together,\" Jackson said. \"I memorized my lines, and I'm ready to go and it's over and the professor says, 'Ketanji, you did such a good job. Matt, we'll talk.'\"",
      "She even debated between her two loves and which path she should pursue.",
      "\"I mean, there were times when I considered doing acting. I'd always wanted to be a lawyer, but I thought, 'Well, maybe I'm pretty good at this,'\" she said.",
      "Jackson reflected on the experience after her performance, \"I think the lesson is: don't give up and don't be deterred, that you can do it. And again, that anything is possible.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:56:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree, reflects on his groundbreaking career, the impact of family and his lasting legacy in film.",
    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "title": "Maggie Rogers on her long-form music: \"I've always loved art that takes time\"",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:07:40 -0500",
    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "Paula Abdul and former \"American Idol\" producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a\u00a0lawsuit in which she alleged he sexually assaulted\u00a0her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show.",
      "Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.",
      "\"I am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,\" Abdul said in a statement Friday. \"This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\"",
      "The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul's attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them.",
      "An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \"American Idol\" and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "Lythgoe said at the time that he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the allegations, which he called \"an appalling smear.\"",

      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \"one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\"",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \"American Idol,\" which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \"began shoving his tongue down her throat.\" Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",
      "\"In tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,\" the lawsuit says, \"but ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.\"",
      "Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.",
      "In 2015, Abdul became a judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" appearing alongside Lythgoe.",
      "Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.",
      "Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.",
      "In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said \"While Paula's history of erratic behavior is well known, I can't pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.\""

This year, the 13-time Grammy Award winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and one of Rolling Stone's greatest singers and guitar players of all time, added another accolade to her already impressive resume: Kennedy Center honoree.",

      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 17:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",
      "Amazon disputes those findings. Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

    "summary": "Scammers are using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to prey on people. But experts say there's a simple way to protect you and your family.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" Scobey said. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause a law that would ban the app in the U.S. as soon as Jan. 19.",
      "\"A modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\" the emergency application said.",
      "TikTok has asked the Supreme Court for an injunction on an emergency basis but has not yet sought review on the merits of the case. In its application, TikTok said the company and its users will suffer \"immediate irreparable harm\" if the ban is not delayed.",
      "\"Congress's unprecedented attempt to single out Applicants and bar them from operating one of the most significant speech platforms in this Nation presents grave constitutional problems that this Court likely will not allow to stand,\" the filing said.",

      "TikTok and ByteDance asked the Supreme Court to make a decision on its request to delay the law by Jan. 6 so they can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law in May, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce a rate decision on Wednesday, Dec. 18. Economists are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will make its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve is likely to make its third consecutive reduction of 2024, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. Yet many experts are also bracing for a slower pace of cuts in 2025 given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed economic policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"The Fed will likely move ahead with another 25-basis point cut at its December meeting,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, in an email, adding,\"This could be the last cut for a while though,\" he said.",
      "\"Because the upcoming Trump Administration's policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting,\" Channel noted.",
      "What date is the Federal Reserve meeting in December?",
      "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is from Dec. 17-18, marking its last meeting of the year.",
      "What time does the Federal Reserve announce rates?",
      "The central bank is set to announce its rate decision on Dec. 18 at 2 p.m. ET.",
      "That will be followed by a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET, during which Powell will discuss the Fed's economic outlook and take questions from reporters.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates in December?",
      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" Daco added.",

      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",
      "Only about $3.7 million was appropriated for the committee for the 2025 inauguration, according to the Congressional Research Service, but taxpayers will be spending more than that. The conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimated that the 2021 inauguration, not counting the security lockdown following the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, cost at least $73 million.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers are moving ahead with a bipartisan bill that would provide enhanced Social Security benefits to millions of Americans, but hurdles remain.",
    "story": [
      "A House-passed bill that would expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans just got a lifeline in the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Chuck Schumer last week started the process for a final vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, which would eliminate two federal policies that keep a portion of Americans from getting their full Social Security benefits, including cops, fire fighters and teachers.",
      "Using his power to invoke cloture \u2014 a process limiting debate and setting a 30-hour window before a final vote must be held \u2014 the proposed legislation as of Monday's Senate schedule was headed for a vote.",
      "One living-and-breathing example is Terry Hoover, a firefighter in Louisville, Kentucky, for more than 20 years. Now retired, he says these two provisions cost his family more than $1,000 a month.",
      "\"My Social Security is reduced due to my pension,\" Hoover, told fellow first responders at a rally earlier in the week, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by a local CBS affiliate. \"And then my wife, she was a nurse for 41 years and paid into the Social Security system, you know, and I cannot draw one penny off of her because of my pension.\"",
      "Schumer, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the legislation,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the bill would \"ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.\" As majority leader, he can invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "That's important, as the clock is ticking as to its fate, with only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Decades in the making, the bill would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said of the proposal, which the league supports. \"We're guardedly optimistic,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch earlier in the month.",
      "The bill had 62 cosponsors when the Senate version was introduced last year, and would now need at least 60 votes to pass Congress and then head to President Biden.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy took to the Senate floor to call for a vote in the chamber. \"If Schumer brings it up, it'll pass,\" said Cassidy, among its Republican sponsors.",
      "Will the Senate pass the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill next week. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Opposition includes the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact. In a statement responding to Schumer's announcement, the group's president, Maya MacGuineas, said it was \"truly astonishing\" that lawmakers would consider speeding up the trust fund's demise.",
      "The measure would increase the burden on Social Security's trust funds, which are already estimated to not be able to pay the full amount of scheduled benefits starting in 2035. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "\"The Senate should reject WEP and GPO repeal. Instead, they should come together to try to fix the issues with WEP and GPO as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen Social Security, prevent insolvency and make the program's finances sustainable over the long term,\" MacGuineas urged.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a vote of 327-75 last month.",
      "If the Senate does not act, the measure \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Shoppers laden with bags from Fendi, Loewe, Prada and other designer labels clog the narrow sidewalks of Milan's swankiest shopping street, bringing joy to the purveyors of high-end luxury goods this, and every, holiday season.",
      "There's even more to celebrate this year: A commercial real estate company has crowned Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",
      "A few store windows down, Franca Da Rold, who was visiting Milan from Belluno, an Italian city in the Dolomites mountain range, marveled at a chunky, meters-long knit scarf priced at 980 euros ($1,028).",
      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

    "title": "Here's what Trump's plans to extend his tax cuts could mean for you",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the accounting and advisory firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

    "story": [
      "Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.",
      "This year's crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year's entrance of into the public domain of Mickey Mouse. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\"It's a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons - he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\" said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke's Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \"There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\"",
      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

      "The recall covers all Stanley Switchback and Trigger Action stainless steel travel mugs, which are double-walled mugs sold in a number of colors and sizes that came with a polypropylene lid, according to the recall notice posted Thursday by the Consumer Safety Product Commission. The Stanley logo, a winged bear with a crown, appears on the front and bottom of the mug.",

    "story": [
      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research in New York City, has a sobering perspective.",
      "\"People who are in their 40s and 50s will do worse than their parents and their grandparents,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Ghilarducci explains that those two previous generations could at least bank on government-sponsored retirement programs.",
      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",
      "With plenty of time to get back on her feet, Childs says that she has finally stopped worrying.",
      "\"Maybe working longer could be on the table,\" Childs said. She is also entertaining the possibility of working part time later in life.",
      "\"I think outside the box,\" she adds. \"...I don't necessarily know exactly know how I'm going to get there, but if I see something, or that's what I want, I often will find a way.\"",

    "summary": "Fast-food worker who provided crucial police tip is eligible for up to $60,000, but getting it will take time.",
    "story": [
      "More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. Two lawsuits allege those bots harmed teen users.",
    "story": [
      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "summary": "Canada could halt oil and gas imports to the U.S. if Donald Trump imposes steep new tariffs, Ontario Premier Doug Ford warns.",
    "story": [
      "The premier of Canada's most populous province on Wednesday threatened to cut off energy supplies to the U.S. if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposed tariffs on Canadian goods. This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",
      "\"We need to be ready to fight. This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\" he said to reporters, referencing Trump's inauguration date, \"and we don't know to what extent this fight is going to go.\"",
      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "In 2023, Ontario also directly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and is a major exporter of power to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Canada retaliated with its own duties on U.S products such as whiskey and yogurt coming from a plant in Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",

      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

      "Bragg's office said in opposing the motion to dismiss that the testimony called into question was, \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence in the case.",
      "Merchan wrote in his ruling that Trump's lawyers failed to object during the trial to testimony it considered improperly admitted.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies in authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "\"Is a President's in-office conduct to conceal payments to an adult film actress to keep information from the public eye relating to an encounter that occurred prior to his Presidency official or unofficial?\" Merchan asked at one point in his ruling.

Between the 2020 election and the 2024 election, Texas gained two Electoral College votes, while five other states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon \u2014 gained one electoral vote each. Six states lost an electoral vote: California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.",

      "Does each elector have to vote with the state election results?",
      "Forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., are winner-take-all, so the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the state's electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors based on the winner of the popular vote within each Congressional District and then two \"at-large\" electors are determined based on winner of the statewide popular vote.",
      "The electors are supposed to vote in accordance with the outcome of the popular vote in their state. The Constitution does not require electors to vote with the winner of the popular vote, but most states have laws that nullify the votes of \"faithless electors.\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that states can punish these \"faithless electors.\"",
      "According to FairVote, there have been 90 \"deviant\" votes cast by electors for president since the founding of the Electoral College, although the majority of these were due to the death of a party's nominee rather than a true deviation from the voters' intent.",
      "There have also been 75 faithless electors for vice president, for a total of 165 faithless electors throughout history, according to FairVote.",
      "After the 2020 election, so-called \"fake\"\u00a0Republican electors in seven battleground states won by President Biden met anyway and cast phony votes for Trump. State criminal charges have been filed against fake electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. In charging Trump for attempting the overturn the election results, special counsel Jack Smith said these fake electors were part of a plan to overturn the election, orchestrated by pro-Trump attorneys with Trump's support. Those charges\u00a0have been dismissed since Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",

      "After the results are signed and certified, they are sent to Harris, acting as the president of the Senate. The vote certificates must be received by the fourth Wednesday in December, which this year is Dec. 25.

      "During remarks at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump blamed the Biden administration for what he said was a \"terrible\" and \"ridiculous\" agreement that would allow tens of thousands of federal workers to continue working from home several days a week.",
      "The president-elect said \"it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it.\" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.",

      "\"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don't want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn't pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month.",

      "Rep. Mike Waltz, the Florida Republican who is Donald Trump's pick for his national security adviser, said Sunday that the president-elect has a good relationship with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who he said also has \"regular engagement\" with Russia amid its war with Ukraine.",
      "\"Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump,\" Waltz said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine.\"",
      "Orb\u00e1n, an authoritarian leader with ties to Russia, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week, along with Waltz and Elon Musk. Days after the meeting, Orb\u00e1n announced that he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that \"we are taking every possible diplomatic step to argue in favor of a ceasefire\" and peace talks. He later appeared to float a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Waltz wouldn't say whether Orb\u00e1n's message to Putin came out of the meeting with Trump. But he noted that \"we're going to continue to talk,\" and that \"President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.\"",
      "\"We need to stop the fighting,\" Waltz said. \"If that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll take a hard look at what that means.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged that he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine immediately upon returning to the White House while claiming that Putin would never have invaded the country if he were president. Waltz said that since Trump's victory in the election, the framework of discussion with world leaders surrounding the war between Russia and Ukraine has shifted to talk of how the conflict comes to an end.",
      "\"How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just a pause?\" Waltz said. \"Those are all things that we're thinking through.\"",
      "The meeting with Orb\u00e1n came after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Dec. 7 in Paris after which Trump called for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to begin.",
      "Zelenskyy said following the president's statement that the war \"cannot simply end with a piece of paper and a few signatures.\" And though he said he had a \"good meeting\" with Trump, he warned that a ceasefire \"without guarantees can be reignited at any moment.\"",

      "But Markarova noted \"we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.\"",

Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said Sunday that the entire presidential pardoning process \"cries out for reform\" following some controversial commutations and pardons made by President Biden, including when the president issued a blanket pardon of his own son, Hunter.",
      "\"This whole process cries out for reform because otherwise you undermine the justice system,\" Klobuchar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

Among the individuals, many of whom had been placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, were some who have sparked controversy in recent days \u2014 including a judge involved in a so-called \"Kids for Cash\" scheme.",
      "Klobuchar interjected that she \"did not like that one,\" adding that she did not agree with all the pardons and commutations.",
      "\"I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group,\" Klobuchar said. \"But there were a number that I think make no sense at all.\"",

      "Klobuchar noted that she has also disagreed with a number of pardons that President-elect Donald Trump made during his first term. And the Minnesota Democrat said that while the pardon ability is part of the Constitution and has a long history that she said wouldn't be changed, she would advocate for reforms.",
      "\"We should have some kind of an outside board that governors have,\" she said. \"Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night.\"",
      "Klobuchar suggested that over a year-long period, a board could look at individual petitions rather than large groups, which she argued undermines the work of FBI agents and prosecutors who took on the cases.",
      "\"Might you want mercy 10 years later?\" Klobuchar said. \"Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",
      "I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A man who committed tax fraud\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: It reminded me, isolation prison in Denesk, which still is operational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: So, look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it at any time.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme): Well, our deliveries so far have been very - very smooth. But we need more delivery options open, which is what this was eluding to.",
      "More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this - this month so far, but we need more. And - and, more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking.",
      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game. And you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide.",
      "Have you seen any change to that?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of need you're looking for. Seventeen billion is the number you are asking for.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and first Trump administration economic adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary, and we're back now with the Vice Chairman of IBM Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House Economic Advisor in President Trump's first term. Gary, welcome back. It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the President's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN: \u00a0 Margaret, thanks for having me. You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7% on consumer prices. Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2%, so we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2% where the Fed would like to get to. That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly- it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points. Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 So the President's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth, we have real wage growth. And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year. Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation. So the economy the President's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive. Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that will actually happen?",
      "COHN: I do think it's going to happen. So net, net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark. It's a- it's an index, it's a benchmark. And remember, the stock market is an index. There's a- there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end that are performing very, very well, and there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn. Gary, before the break, you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So you helped put together the tax plan that's expiring in 20- or part of it expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21%. He really wanted to get it back down to 15 and \"we will be able to do that.\" Will he be able to do that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it. When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time in 2025, you are given instructions by the- by the Budget Committee, They instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you could take in. This time, it will be how much money you can spend. We did not have additional money to spend, so the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21%. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation in 2017 expires the end of 2025, to score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025. So we do know that taxes will be taken up by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation, because if not, the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code. That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants, on either side of the aisle, wants to go back to the prior tax code. You know, when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side, because the vast majority of companies in the United States are small businesses that file on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate, and you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of out of- out of line with each other, so people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter S corporation versus a corporation, so they can take advantage of the tax code. So there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I think you've said in the past, though you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, the business community as a whole, when we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the Business Roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21% tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23% or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN::: Other developed economies.",
      "COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically, we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domiciled companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The pick for Treasury Secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, social security, overtime pay. Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look, Scott is quite an accomplished individual. So look, I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies. There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these promises--",
      "COHN: I agree with that, but we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy, continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you heard the House Speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote. They're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, and do it in kind of an arcane way. When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and I don't know, this could change anyway, there's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy on this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority, budget-related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill, which is border related, where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration, and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes?",
      "COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there, as there were in the Biden administration, use that to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's a big fight to have in the year ahead. Gary, we will be talking to you again, then. We've got to take a break. Thank you."

      "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be back on Margaret, thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record and you actually co-sponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them. Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this, and why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency and three, I appreciated some of the Congressman's words, because what he is talking about is we need to have a new regulatory rules in place here. Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities, and then we've got to figure out, do we really want all these drones, because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future, and they have to be within 400 feet, so these things are going to be what? Flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these. So I think I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be. No one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Republican controlled Senate?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on. You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration, and you'll get to question his selectee to run the FBI Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution. I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI: The approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line-up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record, as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees. Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice. She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So we have to do our due diligence and make decisions. I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency, and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here. And so when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied- he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity. And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission when we should be on a national security safety mission here, when we look at cyber security attacks that you just talked to the congressman about and various other things. He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them, but in the end, it's their decision to demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own. I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1500 Americans more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so called \"Cash for kids\" scheme\u2013",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I did not like that one. Nope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013that sent thousands to jail for millions of dollars, a man who committed tax fraud at a cost of more than $1.6 billion described as \"the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepented tax cheat in U.S. history,\" a woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare. Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles was also commuted. So the way I look at is this- I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son. I also have not agreed with a number of pardons that President Trump gave. So I believe, and I've long advocated for this, that while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that right? Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the army, things like that. That's been going on a long time, but we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House. This makes no sense to me\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category and not the specifics of the case. Was that prudent?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so, I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group. Okay, let's say that. Now I believe that there were, but there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So instead of doing a whole category, why don't in a coming year before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these, that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them based on the facts, instead of just in a large group. So large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just, I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because otherwise you undermine the justice system. And again, I emphasize, this also happened in a big way under President Trump, and you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on Thank you, Margaret.",

I want to ask you a number of topics, but before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department. And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and- and it's- it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is- is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced. We need to know who's behind it. But right now, I think law enforcement seems to be- the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low level, long loitering, could-be-dangerous drones? And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following pre-positioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore. And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles. We need to have an all of the above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Let- let me ask you about China. The President Elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been \"talking and discussing,\" as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping. CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back and forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing. I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So the outreach has been tremendous. President Trump is taking all calls, as you know. He believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head of state level. And those conversations- those conversations are ongoing, but they are, really, nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties. We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but as I've said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans. Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated. You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ\u00a0 I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are- we have been, over the years, trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber. We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense. The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point. And then finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is this sanctions?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: \u2014us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one, but taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off, is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar a Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself. He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n seems to be floating a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump, and I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style-",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings. President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll- we'll take a hard look at what that means. But until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no message was sent through Orb\u00e1n to Putin by Trump. Is that- that's what I understand you saying there.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to- yeah, I'm not going to get into specifics of back and forths. But, one is talking, of course, we're going to continue to talk, and the- President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check, in his interview with Time magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't- you know, just isn't a strategy. This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into. What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what's the framework for- for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45 minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to- that framework I just talked about. How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just- not just a pause? Those are all things that we're thinking through. And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO Secretary General came here to Mar a Lago, he's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in- whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East. During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014. President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. 1000s of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're importantly taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody. And you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term, and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained. So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration, and we'll see moving forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Mike Waltz, thank you for joining us today."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Cindy McCain, U.N. World Food Programme executive director, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Executive Director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme Cindy McCain. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, you are looking at a globe very much in crisis, but I want to start on the hot spot of Syria. USAID said the World Food Programme was able to reach 70,000 people in Syria over the last week, but you need supply lines to remain open. Is there a threat right now to your deliveries? And if so, where is that coming from?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, our deliveries so far have been very- very smooth, but we need more delivery options open, which is what this was alluding to. More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this- this month so far, but we need more. And- and more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking. We had- there's a lot of people, a lot of hunger at stake, a lot of malnutrition that was already pre-existing, that now- that now we need to handle as well. You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there, but now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get, not just more trucks, but more people in, so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you need Turkey to open up supply lines or surrounding countries? Is that right?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, correct. We need everybody around us, Turkey, all the countries surrounding us, to make sure that we can get in and get in smoothly, again, unfettered and, of course, in a safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you're trying to scale up to reach nearly 3 million people who need some help right now. The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "MCCAIN: Not really. We've- we've been able to, as- as you said, we've been able to move our goods, through, our food items, etc, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But- but I don't- I will never understate- underestimate the process with things that it could infringe us later on. So I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods again in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed. And that's the most important part that we need too, we need access, and we need the ability to feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now, if you want to know the truth. There's so much, there's so many- many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings. No one's paying any attention to it. Syria being one of them. And we need- we need, obviously, a great deal of funds in- in particular within Syria, but in other countries too. You're talking about Sudan, we're talking about Yemen, we're talking about Ethiopia and other places where- where people are desperate right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah. Countries are- are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing- choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. We- you know, we- I always send out the oral plea to be able to- to encourage people and encourage countries to be- to get involved and to stay involved. And I'm asking now, I'm asking on your show, worldwide, to please consider, once again, giving to Syria, because people in Syria will starve to death without it, and- and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations, and you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game, and you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide. Have you seen any change to that?",
      "MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now, and hunger- hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide, and it does affect national security. So it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S., as- as we just said, the most generous here, the president-elect has selected a rising star in the Republican Party, Elise Stefanik, to be the representative at the United Nations, and also a cabinet member. That indicates an important voice at the table. Congressman Stefanik- Congresswoman Stefanik called for a complete reassessment of U.S. funding for the United Nations. Are you concerned that you will see a negative impact on funding?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm not concerned, because when I came into this job, I knew that funding was not going to be at the level that it had been. So we've gone through a complete- complete reboot on not only scaling down our operations and making sure that we're more efficient, more effective, and- and making sure that our people in- we push everything to this- to the- to the field now, so that our people in the field can get the job done. We- this was something I came in knowing I was going to have to do, is scale down, make sure that- that we work better, more efficiently, more effectively, and make sure that we get food to the people that need it the most in a quick and safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We- right now, we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly, Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where- where famine does exist, as you know, it's been declared there. And we need- we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can- can access from that direction as well. It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in, but we need more. People are starving to death, and once again, it's- it's- I sound like a broken record, but we need to be able to get in in a safe and unfettered- unfettered manner, so that we can get the job done. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that because if people are insecure from a food- from- from a food reality, they're not going to behave well, and things- they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this. The countries that are affected right now, and the big ones that we- that we look to, are all affected because of conflict. It's- the food security issue is- is very directly caused by conflict within the arena that they're in. So it's very important that we pay attention to that particular issue as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Given the- the scale of the famine and the malnutrition in Sudan, is it food that you're trying to bring in, or is it more, you know, specialized medical assistance? How do you deal with the children, for example, who are being so hurt in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, yes, part of that is making sure that- that our folks from UNICEF, our folks from W.H.O. can get in because there are specialized and- specialized products that are needed for, especially the infants, that are so severely- severely malnourished. And it's our job to help not just get our stuff in, but get their stuff in as well, in any way that we can. We're a team player in all this, and we make sure that we- we access and talk to all of our partners within the field so that we can work together. Yes. I mean, these are these- these people, and these children especially, have been so deprived of nourishment for so long that they need highly-specialized items to be able- to be able to beat malnutrition and at least have some chance at life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's- what's going on. Listen- this- we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know- and of course, now we're into December. But so- the- the- the inability for us to not only to- to move our trucks and get it to where it needs to go, but the insecurity that's caused from it, the- the- the targeting of- of humanitarian aid workers and making sure that we can't move or that- or that they feel insecure. This whole- this whole issue of not being able to get in, is- is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire, and we need it now. We can't- there's- we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of- of crowds just crushing people, amassing at bakeries in Gaza. 90% of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is man-made.",
      "MCCAIN: It is man-made, you're- you're absolutely right. It is man-made and and- and more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just- not just do they need food, but we need access. And the targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job, and- and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. Children, especially, are starving to death. I mean, the height of malnutrition, the height of- of hunger within- within that region, is- is unbelievably horrible, and so we've seen it firsthand. And I- I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are- I'm calling for a cease-fire, and I want my aid, my fellow partners within this arena, to call for the same thing. We need a cease-fire. We need access, and we need it now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You used the word--",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 -- Again, remember, food security is national security, and that's what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running, if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the- the lawlessness. There is absolutely no- no law- law to be held, you know, to be even talked about there, because it doesn't exist. And so we need all of those kinds of things to be put into place so that we can work in a safe manner and get- get the food to where it's go- where it needs to go. Again, we've gotten two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of needs. You're looking for 17 billion is the number you are asking for. We wish you good luck feeding the world.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good to have you back with us.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No Western Power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelensky said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, so and we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support. Yesterday, we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the word about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already, and we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look we we see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions. So it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this axis of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kursk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in Modern Warfare, and they're learning in Ukraine- I mean, right there.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this and Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raised the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military Recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up this fight?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have, first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine, and they are volunteering, and women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces. With the recruitment, the last changes to the law on mobilization already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on, so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Korean to unprepared Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us, because every person matters for Ukrainians. Of course there are challenges, and we have the plan and we know how to do it, because again, this is our home we are defending. So when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country, but weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3000 Glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us.",
      "There's missiles for both Russian and North Korean missiles. I mean, it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone. But Donald Trump gave an interview to Time Magazine, and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons- missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, let me say, start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually, to provide us with lethal aid in the first place\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013back in 2017.",

We liberated more than 50% that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea, just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could, they- we can stop them the more equipment we have, especially including the longer range equipment in order to be able to degrade the attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table, because, again, Ukraine wants peace. Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict, and we negotiated at the first sign- remember, in 2022 when Russians started negotiations, they, of course, did not negotiate peace. They negotiated the pause. As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",

He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be but we do know that Viktor Orban was at Mar-a-Lago this past week, and he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",

      "Trump claimed in the filing Stephanopoulos \"knows that these statements are patently and demonstrably false.\"",
      "As part of the settlement, ABC News must also publish an \"editor's note\" at the bottom of the March 10 online article that accompanied the interview which states: \"ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.\"",
      "Trump's presidential foundation and museum have yet to be established. As part of the deal, ABC News will also pay Trump's attorneys $1 million to cover legal fees.",
      "The settlement, dated Friday, was signed by both Trump and Stephanopoulos.",

      "The jury, however, did not find Trump liable for rape. He was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in damages. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations.",
      "In an August 2023 ruling in which he dismissed a defamation counterclaim from Trump against Carroll, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the jury had concluded Trump was not liable for rape because the case technically did meet the level of proof required under New York's penal code.",

      "But if being out in the predawn hours seems unlikely for you Sunday, you don't necessarily need to catch it exactly at the peak. The moon will appear full for several days. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",

      "How long will December's moon be full?",
      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14.

      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",
      "With the bright moon on peak night, an observer in the U.S. may see around 15 Geminids an hour, Cooke said.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "The Geminid meteor shower is visible around the world and throughout the night sky. For optimal viewing conditions, head somewhere far away from city and street lights, then lie down flat on your back with your feet pointed south. Give your eyes half an hour to adjust to the dark.",

      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",

      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids actually come from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. NASA researchers say the asteroid acts like a \"weird\" comet.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",

      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" Scobey said. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",

      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",
      "\"Congress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok's American users from the Chinese Communist Party. We urge TikTok to immediately execute a qualified divestiture,\" they wrote.",

An ad-supported subscription costs $9.99, while the ad-free version costs $15.99 monthly. It also hiked the price of its Hulu + Live TV bundle.",

    "summary": "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. Two lawsuits allege those bots harmed teen users.",
    "story": [
      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction in state court remains on the books Monday, after a New York judge rejected an effort by Trump to have the case tossed based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan found that a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts did not preclude a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan wrote that evidence shown at trial pertained \"entirely to unofficial conduct,\" beyond the scope of the Supreme Court's ruling, which he described as narrow.",
      "\"If error occurred regarding the introduction of the challenged evidence, such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said at the time he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Since then, Trump filed another motion to dismiss the case, arguing that his forthcoming return to the White House required it.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have fought that effort, saying there's no law that requires dismissing a state case after conviction because the defendant was elected to the presidency.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "A unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The nation's highest court said in that decision that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and the indictment thrown out. They argued that his trial included testimony from former White House staff that should have been barred.",
      "Bragg's office said in opposing the motion to dismiss that the testimony called into question was, \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence in the case.",
      "Merchan wrote in his ruling that Trump's lawyers failed to object during the trial to testimony it considered improperly admitted.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies in authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "\"Is a President's in-office conduct to conceal payments to an adult film actress to keep information from the public eye relating to an encounter that occurred prior to his Presidency official or unofficial?\" Merchan asked at one point in his ruling. He concluded they were unofficial acts, but later added, even if they hadn't been, \"use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger\" to the presidency.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denies Daniels' story. Trump has promised to appeal the conviction. He is separately able to appeal Merchan's ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung, referring to Merchan as an \"acting Justice,\" said the \"decision by deeply conflicted, acting Justice Merchan\u00a0 in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed, as President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process, and execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this, or any other, Witch Hunt.

      "Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. and create 100,000 jobs in artificial intelligence and technology, President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday at Mar-a-Lago alongside SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.",
      "\"Today, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum,\" Trump said, adding that Son was announcing the investment \"because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rosie Clayburn is a descendant of the Yurok Tribe, which had its territory \u2014 called 'O Rew in the Yurok language \u2014 ripped from them nearly two centuries ago.",
      "\"As the natural world became completely decimated, so did the Yurok people,\" she said.",
      "That decimation started when miners rushed in for gold, killing and displacing tens of thousands of Native Americans in California and ravaging the redwood trees for lumber.",
      "\"Everything was extracted that was marketable,\" Clayburn said. \"We've always had this really intricate relationship with the landscape. We've hunted, we've fished, we've gathered. And those are all management tools. Everything that we do has been in balance with the natural world.\"",
      "Now, generations later, 125 acres bordering Redwood National and State Parks will be handed back to the Yuroks.",
      "The nonprofit Save the Redwoods League purchased the land in 2013 from an old timber mill, with the original goal of giving it to the National Park Service.",
      "\"As we continued conversations about the transfer of this land to the National Park Service, we began to realize that perhaps a better alternative would be to transfer the land back to the Yurok Tribe,\" said Save the Redwoods League's Paul Ringgold. \"No one knows this land better. They've been stewarding this land since time and memorial\"",
      "Ringgold said that stewardship includes controlled burns to clear dead vegetation \u2014 a native practice once outlawed, but now recognized as essential in preventing catastrophic wildfires.",
      "\"Indigenous populations have been using fire as a management tool,\" he said. \"We'd like to see that kind of practice return.\"",
      "Redwoods serve as some of the largest stores of carbon on the planet. A single tree can capture up to 250 tons in its lifetime, the equivalent of removing nearly 200 cars from the road for an entire year.",
      "But between logging and fires, 95% of California's redwoods have been destroyed. Over the past decade, the Yurok have been helping restore the land.",
      "Another forgotten jewel of the ecosystem is salmon. The fish were once so plentiful, they were eaten with most meals. The Yurok word for salmon even translates to \"that which we eat.\" But the salmon population has dwindled to about one-quarter of what it was 20 years ago, according to a coalition of state and federal agencies.",
      "The tribe is working to bolster the fish's population by building a stream channel, two connected ponds and about 20 acres of floodplain.",
      "\"You have salmon who provide for humans, but they also provide for other animals,\" Clayburn said. \"And then when they spawn and die, they put nutrients back in the ground. And so, everything just has this, this balance and this reciprocal way.\"",
      "That balance is returning. There's been a rebound in the salmon population and the Yuroks also recently reintroduced the California condor \u2014 a scavenger that's important to the ecosystem \u2014  back into the wild for the first time this century.",
      "\"It tells us that our land's healing and that our people are gonna heal,\" Clayburn said.",
      "The Yuroks will take full control of 'O Rew in 2026 and, in a first-of-its-kind partnership, receive help managing it from the Save the Redwoods League, California State Parks and The National Park Service.",
      "\"We understand some of the mistakes we made as a federal government, and it's a chance to begin that healing with the native tribes all across the United States,\" said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams.",
      "For Sams, the first Native American to lead the agency, the partnership is personal.",
      "\"We've been writing our histories separately. There's been the native history and then the American history. This is a chance when we're doing co-stewardship and co-management to write history together,\" he said.",
      "Of the 431 parks managed by the National Park Service, 109 of them now have formal co-stewardship agreements with indigenous tribes, with 43 more on the way.",
      "In addition to restoration work, plans for 'O Rew include the creation of new trails, the construction of a traditional Yurok village and a state-of-the-art visitor center. The visitor center will display Yurok artifacts and highlight the tribe's history and culture, with the goal of educating new visitors on the land's history and significance from the perspective of those who have lived on it the longest.",
      "\"I really hope 'O Rew symbolizes a coming home of the Yurok people and reconnecting with our landscape,\" said Clayburn.",

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that the FBI has received about 5,000 tips of reported drone sightings in the last few weeks, \"about 100 of which they felt needed to be followed up on.\"",
      "Authorities say many of the reported drone sightings could be aircraft or helicopters operating from the region's numerous airports, as residents increasingly turn their attention to the skies in search of answers.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim said he went on patrol with police on Thursday night to find out more about the drones. In a lengthy X thread, Kim said he \"concluded that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.\"",
      "Kirby said many other reports were determined to be \"a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones.\"",
      "In addition, unrelated videos have sparked confusion. On Friday, a video was widely shared and said to show a mysterious drone seemingly \"shooting\" at the ground. However, CBS News traced the footage to a military training exercise at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "People have also shared old videos from different contexts. One widely shared clip, allegedly showing drones over New York, is at least four years old.",

Mike Waltz, a Republican from Florida who is President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security adviser, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the lack of information highlights lapses in authority between local law enforcement and federal agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from,\" Waltz said. \"It's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said there is a \"growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state\" despite statements from federal investigators assuring residents that the drones do not pose public safety threats.",

      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:38:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump's threat to sue the Des Moines Register comes on the heels of ABC's agreement to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit he filed earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "The announcement Saturday that ABC has agreed to commit $15 million toward President-elect Donald Trump's presidential foundation to settle a defamation lawsuit was a rare victory for Trump in years of lawsuits against news organizations.",
      "In the settlement's aftermath, Trump said Monday at a news conference in Florida that he planned to sue the Des Moines Register over a poll and vowed to continue filing suits against news outlets whom he's long accused of bias.",
      "He complained that the pollster, J. Ann Selzer, \"said I was going to lose by three or four points,\" after previous Iowa surveys showed he'd win the state easily, \"by 20 points.\" Trump won the state by 13 points.",
      "\"In my opinion, it was fraud and it was election interference,\" he said, adding, \"we'll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.\"",
      "Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the Des Moines Register, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We have acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll did not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump's Election Day victory in Iowa by releasing the poll's full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unweighted data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer.\"",
      "\"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\" Anton said.",
      "Such litigation is unusual for presidents to pursue, according to Ohio University professor Aimee Edmondson. Trump has a long history of suing the media, she said, though his lawsuits aren't often successful.",
      "\"It's a rarity that he would actually win a settlement against a journalistic outlet, when I saw that I was astonished,\" said Edmondson, who researches media law and journalism history.",
      "Trump has sued CNN, The Washington Post and the New York Times multiple times, including during his first term in office. It's a tactic he pursued both before and after his presidency, suing journalists and their book publishers, and major outlets \u2014 including CBS News \u2014 for coverage he didn't like.",
      "Edmondson said the lawsuits appear to have an added benefit for Trump.",
      "\"He has really done a good job repeating that message that journalists are the enemy of the people,\" Edmondson said.",
      "During the press conference on Monday, Trump said, \"I feel I have to do this,\" and added, \"It costs a lot of money to do it but we have to straighten out the press.\"",
      "While Trump's recent lawsuits have focused on outlets that are subsidiaries of deep pocketed corporations, Edmondson said she worries they might inspire others to sue \"mom and pop\" local media in response to coverage.",
      "\"Think of the state and county local officials, who might say, \"Oh, this will be a great way to punish local journalists,\" Edmondson said.",
      "Trump's suits often demand extraordinary figures from the defendants. Trump sued Timothy O'Brien after the journalist wrote a book questioning Trump's claims about his own net worth, demanding $5 billion in damages. The case was dismissed, and Trump later told a reporter for The Washington Post that he knew he couldn't win the suit.",
      "\"I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump sued ABC for defamation after anchor George Stephanolopous said that Trump had been \"found liable for rape\" during a March 10 interview with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.",
      "A unanimous civil jury in 2023 found Trump liable for sexual abuse of the writer E. Jean Carroll. The sexual abuse claim included an allegation that Trump forced his fingers inside Carroll against her will. The federal judge who presided over the case later wrote, \"the jury implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll.\"",
      "Trump sued CBS News in October, accusing the network of \"deceitful\" editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump has claimed CBS News edited Harris' response to a question about conflict in the Middle East in order to mislead the public. He reiterated that claim Monday.",
      "\"They took Kamala's answer which was a crazy answer, a horrible answer, and they took the whole answer out and they replaced it with something else she said later in the interview,\" Trump claimed.",
      "CBS News said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed that its claims are \"completely without merit.\" The network said it will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "CBS filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Dec. 6, arguing the case has no merit and that it should not have been filed in Texas, which is home to neither the defendant or plaintiff. CBS is New York-based, and Trump lives in Florida.",
      "Trump has also sued journalist Bob Woodward and publisher Simon & Schuster in January 2023, claiming Woodward publicly released interview recordings made for the book \"Rage\" without Trump's permission.",
      "Trump said Monday that Woodward \"didn't quote me properly from the tapes,\" and he claimed Woodward \"sold the tapes, which he wasn't allowed to do.\"",
      "The publisher's parent company at the time, Paramount Global, was named as a defendant as well. Paramount is also CBS News' parent company.",
      "Soon after the case was filed, Simon & Schuster and Woodward released a joint statement calling the lawsuit meritless.",
      "\"All these interviews were on the record and recorded with President Trump's knowledge and agreement,\" the statement said. \"Moreover, it is in the public interest to have this historical record in Trump's own words. We are confident that the facts and the law are in our favor.\"",
      "The case is ongoing, and the defendants have asked a judge to dismiss the suit.",
      "In 2022, Trump sued the board that bestows journalism's most prestigious award, the Pulitzer Prize. The case revolves around a statement the board made reaffirming its decision to give The New York Times and The Washington Post an award in 2018 for reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",
      "An investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller III later found \"insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.\"",
      "Trump said Monday, \"it turned out to be a hoax and they were exactly wrong.\"",
      "The Pulitzer Prize Board put out its statement after Trump called for it to revoke its 2018 awards. The board said two independent reviews found \"no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.\"",

    "summary": "E-commerce giant executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations urging production quotas be curtailed.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon knew of the link between increased worker injuries and the company's production quotas, but its executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations to loosen its mandates, an investigation by lawmakers found.",
      "The findings are based on Internal Amazon documents compiled by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "\"The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon's warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Amazon's executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.\"",
      "Amazon disputes the findings and accused Sanders of misrepresenting the company's safety record.",
      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",
      "Amazon disputes those findings. Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" Scobey said. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce a rate decision on Wednesday, Dec. 18. Economists are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will make its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve is likely to make its third consecutive reduction of 2024, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. Yet many experts are also bracing for a slower pace of cuts in 2025 given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed economic policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"The Fed will likely move ahead with another 25-basis point cut at its December meeting,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, in an email, adding,\"This could be the last cut for a while though,\" he said.",
      "\"Because the upcoming Trump Administration's policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting,\" Channel noted.",
      "What date is the Federal Reserve meeting in December?",
      "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is from Dec. 17-18, marking its last meeting of the year.",
      "What time does the Federal Reserve announce rates?",
      "The central bank is set to announce its rate decision on Dec. 18 at 2 p.m. ET.",
      "That will be followed by a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET, during which Powell will discuss the Fed's economic outlook and take questions from reporters.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates in December?",
      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",

      "Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson swapped her judge's robes for a Broadway costume Saturday night, stepping onto the stage for a one-time performance in the hit musical comedy \"& Juliet.\" The sold-out audience was treated to a special moment as Jackson made her Broadway debut, impressing both her fellow performers and the crowd.",
      "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King after the show, Jackson reflected on the experience. \"I think that it means that anything is possible,\" she said. \"Five years ago, I was a district court justice; nobody knew who I was. To have both of the pieces of my fondest dreams come true in this little bit of time has been extraordinary for me.\"",
      "\"I'm overwhelmed with the joy of this experience. I'm so grateful to the staff and crew of '& Juliet' for helping my dream come true. It was phenomenal,\" Jackson added.",
      "When King asked what was going through her mind before stepping on stage, Jackson responded, \"I was just like, 'Wow, this is really gonna happen.' And I was going through my lines.\"",
      "Childhood dream",
      "In her memoir \"Lovely One,\" Jackson revealed her lifelong love for theater and shared her aspiration to become the first Supreme Court Justice to perform on Broadway.",
      "\"I just always loved theater. And I felt very comfortable on stage. You know, I was always performing from when I was really young. It just felt like the theater people were my people,\" Jackson said during an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" at the Civilian Hotel in New York just before her first rehearsal.",
      "\"My best friend was a girl named Sunny Schleifer, and the two of us would make up skits and dress up and do all of these things. When I got into high school, I did speech and debate. I had these two different loves, the law and theater,\" she said.",
      "Jackson's Broadway debut included two scenes written specifically for her in \"& Juliet,\" a musical that celebrates female empowerment and controlling one's own destiny. \"It's a wonderful message and obviously very fun,\" Jackson said.",
      "Before stepping onto the Broadway stage, Jackson participated in table reads, scene walkthroughs and vocal sessions, preparing for the performance.",
      "Reflecting on her early days as an aspiring actor, Jackson recalled a drama class at Harvard where she acted alongside a classmate who would later become famous: Matt Damon. \"We just were in a drama class together,\" Jackson said. \"I memorized my lines, and I'm ready to go and it's over and the professor says, 'Ketanji, you did such a good job. Matt, we'll talk.'\"",
      "She even debated between her two loves and which path she should pursue.",
      "\"I mean, there were times when I considered doing acting. I'd always wanted to be a lawyer, but I thought, 'Well, maybe I'm pretty good at this,'\" she said.",
      "Jackson reflected on the experience after her performance, \"I think the lesson is: don't give up and don't be deterred, that you can do it. And again, that anything is possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airline travel in 2025 is set to become more dignified for passengers with disabilities under a new Department of Transportation rule.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday announced enhanced protections for people with disabilities traveling on commercial airlines. The new regulations are aimed in particular at protecting\u00a0passengers who use wheelchairs, after a series of violations of existing laws by airlines.",
      "For example, the new rule requires training for airlines workers responsible for physically assisting passengers with disabilities and handling their wheelchairs. It also outlines steps airlines must take if they damage or misplace a passenger's wheelchair \u2014 all in an effort to make the skies friendlier for the roughly 5.5 million Americans use a wheelchair.",
      "DOT data shows that one in every 100 wheelchairs or scooters transported on domestic flights is damaged, delayed, or lost.",
      "Setting a new standard",
      "Indeed, when a passenger is unable to access or use their mobility device, they're effectively deprived of their freedom until it's returned or replaced.",
      "Concern over airlines' mishandling of records leads many passengers with disabilities to avoid air travel altogether, research has shown.",
      "\"Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly \u2014 and we've taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,\" Secretary Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. \"With the new protections we're announcing today, we're establishing a new standard for air travel \u2014 with clear and thorough guidelines for airlines to ensure that passengers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.\"",
      "Here's some of what the new rule requires.",
      "The rule requires that airlines assist individuals with disabilities without putting them at heightened risk of bodily injury. It must also assist them in a \"dignified\" manner, by respecting their independence, autonomy and privacy.\u00a0Airline personnel must be trained annually on physically assisting passengers who use wheelchairs or mobility devices. They must demonstrate their qualifications through competency assessments or by certification exam.It requires that passengers with disabilities receive prompt assistance when boarding and deplaning aircraft, including moving within the airport terminal.\u00a0Airlines must return all checked wheelchairs and other assistive devices to passengers in the same condition they were received.Improved seating accommodations at airports.",

      "During remarks at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump blamed the Biden administration for what he said was a \"terrible\" and \"ridiculous\" agreement that would allow tens of thousands of federal workers to continue working from home several days a week.",
      "The president-elect said \"it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it.\" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.",

      "\"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don't want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn't pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month.",
      "Musk then claimed on social media earlier this month that \"almost no one\" who is employed by the government works in-person, leading to \"thousands of empty buildings not just in America, but around the world, paid for with your tax dollars!\"",
      "In his remarks from Mar-a-Lago, Trump appeared to be referencing an agreement reached by the Social Security Administration and the American Federation of Government Employees earlier this month. The deal keeps in place the agency's current telework policy until October 2029.",
      "Under the plan, employees must be in the office between two and five days per week, depending on their jobs, according to Bloomberg News. There are roughly 42,000 Social Security Administration workers who are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees.",

      "The federal government employs more than 4 million people, including 2.2 million civilians. An August report from the Office of Management and Budget found that as of May, about 54% work every day in roles that aren't eligible for telework. The agency said that personnel who are eligible to work remotely spent 61% of regular working hours in the office.",
      "Of the more than 2 million civilian government workers, 228,000, or 10%, were in remote positions where they were not expected to work in-person on a regular basis, according to the Office of Management and Budget's report.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation and reportedly killing at least six people. Casualties were arriving at hospitals and among the buildings seriously damaged in the capital of Port Vila was one that houses the U.S. embassy.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "Katie Greenwood, the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross' Pacific branch, said in a social media post that at least six people had been confirmed dead and many more injured.",
      "The temblor hit just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 35 miles and was centered 18 miles west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that's home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down, but Greenwood of the IFRC said multiple buildings had collapsed and the hospital in the capital was damaged.",
      "Doctors were working \"as fast as they could\" at a triage center outside the emergency ward, journalist Dan McGarry told The Associated Press, adding that the nation wasn't well equipped to deal with a mass casualty event. Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital.",
      "In the first official information published by Vanuatu's government, the Geohazards Department said on social media that its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages. Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours, and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila, including those of the U.S., Britain, France and New Zealand, was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said, but the U.S. Embassy said in a message posted on its Facebook page that all staff were safe, though the building was closed until further notice.",
      "The U.S. mission only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "A video posted on social media showed the building with some damage, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground.",
      "The French news agency AFP said its photos showed the ground floor of the diplomatic building completely flattened. The bottom floor \"no longer exists,\" Vanuatu resident Michael Thompson told AFP by satellite phone after posting images of the destruction on social media. \"It is just completely flat. The top three floors are still holding but they have dropped.\"",
      "\"There's people in the buildings in town. There were bodies there when we walked past,\" Thompson said. The quake also knocked down at least two bridges and toppled other buildings, he said.",
      "McGarry, the journalist, said a \"massive landslide\" at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway was also damaged, he said.",
      "Vanuatu's position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6 aren't uncommon, and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",
      "\"I think it could have been worse,\" McGarry said. But this was the most serious he had experienced during 21 years in Vanuatu, \"by a long shot,\" he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport couldn't be contacted Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",
      "Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters her country would provide whatever help was needed. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said 45 New Zealanders were registered as being in Vanuatu and his government was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation there.",
      "Vanuatu has been led by four prime ministers in four years and is due to go to the polls in January for a snap election. In November, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai asked President Nikenike Vurobaravu to dissolve Parliament so he wouldn't have to face a no-confidence vote as his recent predecessors did.",

There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked.",
      "Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations.",

He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department said at the time that Austin's discussions concerned \"opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security,\" and other matters.",

      "The U.S. and others suggest China's navy is establishing a permanent base at Ream, which would give it easier access to the Malacca Strait, a critical shipping route between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.",
      "Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.",
      "Cambodia's government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion.",
      "Washington has said the Ream base could give Beijing a key strategic position in the Gulf of Thailand near the disputed South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety.",
      "Chinese warships first docked at the 1,190-foot pier in December last year. Two berthed at Sihanoukville port in May as part of Beijing's biggest joint military drills with Cambodia.",
      "The Chinese military unveiled machine gun-equipped \"robodogs\" this year at the annual joint exercises, known as the \"Golden Dragon\" drills.",
      "Cambodia's defense ministry said 27 U.S. navy vessels have visited the nation since 2007, although the USS Savannah's visit was the first docking in eight years.",
      "On Monday, Beijing responded to the U.S. warship's visit to Sihanoukville saying \"such exchanges and collaborations in security and defense should contribute to promoting regional peace and stability, rather than the opposite.\"",
      "In September, Cambodia's Defense Ministry said that China is giving its navy two warships of the type it has had docked there for months. China is set to hand over two newly built Type 56 corvettes - smaller vessels typically used for coastal patrols - next year at the earliest, after Cambodia requested China's support.",
      "Cambodia's defense ministry said the Savannah's port call will include \"a working meeting with the commander of the Ream Naval Base,\" as well as meetings with provincial officials and \"a friendship sports competition between the crews of the U.S. Navy and the Cambodian Navy.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Weapons of war accumulated by the toppled Assad regime over half of a century are being systemically obliterated by massive Israeli airstrikes.",
    "story": [
      "Damascus\u00a0\u2014 A CBS News team drove through a Syrian military airbase on the outskirts of capital city Damascus Monday, and the devastation caused by Israeli air strikes was abundantly clear. Israel has said it's determined to destroy weapons and other military hardware that ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his father spent half of a century accumulating, before it can fall into the hands of extremists.",
      "The Israeli military has pounded Syrian military infrastructure relentlessly since Assad fled to Russia earlier this month \u2014 forced out by a shock rebel offensive after a decade of civil war that had, until about two weeks ago, largely ground to an apparent stalemate.",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "The damage inflicted on Assad's old war machine has been staggering. One strike overnight in the coastal city of Tartus, for instance, was so massive that the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group quoted a scientist in Turkey as saying it had registered on the Richter scale as the equivalent of a category-3 earthquake.",
      "Until Moscow's ally Assad fled from Syria, Russia maintained its only major naval base outside of Russian territory in Tartus. Satellite imagery (below) showed most of the Russian ships disappearing from the Tartus port quickly after Assad fell, but the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that it was still figuring out what to do about its military hardware and personnel in the country, in talks with the country's new de-facto rebel rulers.",
      "Israel's military, meanwhile, says it has laid waste to most of Assad's heavy weapons and air defenses. In a statement on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that in recent days its fighter jets had \"inflicted severe damage on Syria's most strategic weapons: fighter jets and helicopters, Scud missiles, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea precision-guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, radars, rockets, and more.\"",
      "The IDF said its strikes had destroyed \"over 90% of the identified strategic surface-to-air missiles\" of the ousted regime.",
      "The lightning takeover of Syria one week ago by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or HTS, has also seen Israeli forces carry out a land incursion that stretches past the occupied Golan Heights region into a previously demilitarized buffer zone inside Syria.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's new de-facto leader, has criticized what he described as Israel's \"uncalculated military adventures,\" and said he and his group \u2014 which, before publicly distancing itself from extremist ideology was an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 was more interested in state-building than opening another conflict with Israel.",
      "The targeting of Syria's military sites has also revealed deep neglect by Assad. Years of corruption and a decade of civil war had hollowed out the nation's armed forces, contributing to his regime's collapse. Much of the hardware left behind by his forces when they surrendered to the rebels or simply shed their uniforms and ran away is old and clearly lacking maintenance.",
      "Assad's office issued the first statement attributed to the deposed leader since he was forced to flee from his country, meanwhile. In it, he claims he never considered resigning nor fleeing, but that he took shelter in the Russian-run air base at Hmeimim as the rebels closed in, and when that facility came under a sustained drone attack, he says an evacuation was ordered on Dec. 8, the day after the HTS rebels took the capital Damascus.",
      "He said he eventually left for Russia as there was nothing else he could do in Syria, lamenting the country's fall \"into the hands of terrorism.\"",
      "The statement was posted to the Syrian Presidency's official channel on the Telegram messaging app, with a note saying it had been posted after several unsuccessful attempts to release it through Arabic and international media outlets. The statement was deleted relatively quickly from the Telegram channel, however, without any explanation, before reappearing there and on the presidency's Facebook page.",
      "While the wider international community is still trying to figure out how to deal with HTS, which has said it will respect Syrians all of religions and appears determined to be viewed as a secular interim administration \u2014 though it has not said what will come next for the country after a three-month transitional period \u2014 Israel and the U.S. have remained focused largely on securing Assad's stockpiled weapons.",
      "For Israel, that has meant the most ferocious airstrikes carried out in Syria in years, and they continued on Monday, just over a week after Assad's sudden departure.",
      "Whoever does end up in control of Syria will inherit a military infrastructure largely in tatters. Judging by the IDF's statement on Monday, claiming its strikes amounted to \"a significant achievement for the Israeli Air Force's superiority in the region,\" that could be exactly as intended.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, one side in a civil war that's torn the African nation apart for more than a year and created one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet, are accused of raping scores of women and girls and using some as sex slaves in a new report by Human Rights Watch. The New York-based rights group says the paramilitary forces' use of sexual violence in the country's South Kordofan state since September 2023 constitutes war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.",
      "HRW lays out the findings of an investigation based on the cases of almost 80 women and girls in a report published Monday, detailing horrific new allegations of abuse in Sudan, where both sides in the civil war had already been accused of war crimes.",
      "Researchers gathered evidence on 79 women and girls between the ages of 7 and 50 whom HRW says were raped, with most incidents occurring at an RSF military base in Dibeibat, near the town of Habila in South Kordofan.",
      "Survivors and witnesses told the group that the men who carried out the attacks were all uniformed RSF forces or members of allied militias.",
      "\"Survivors described being gang raped in front of their families and over prolonged periods of time, including while being held as sex slaves,\" said HRW Associate Crisis and Conflict Director Belkis Wille, who conducted many of the interviews with the survivors.",
      "Ezzaddean Elsafi, a senior RSF adviser, denied the accusations in the HRW report to CBS News, claiming \"people wearing RSF uniforms\" behind the alleged attacks were impersonators, not actual RSF forces.",
      "\"RSF takes this very seriously and will investigate.  We are highly sensitive to sexual violence against women and the perpetrators will be held accountable,\" said Elsafi, denying that the group even has a significant presence in South Kordofan, though acknowledging it has forces \"in the Debibat area,\" near the boarder with North Kordofan state.",
      "\"This is absolutely disinformation,\" he said of the HRW report.",
      "HRW said it had shared a summary of its investigation's findings with the RSF's overall commander, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, but had not received a response.",
      "Wille has spent years documenting sexual violence in conflicts around the world, including by ISIS militants against Yazidi women in Iraq, but she told CBS News, \"What is really astonishing to me after meeting these women and girls is the scope and scale\" of the crimes in Sudan.",
      "CBS News has seen video of the full interview HRW conducted with an 18-year-old woman whom the group identified as Hania. She said she was pregnant in February when RSF fighters burst into her home in Habila and grabbed her, her 17-year-old neighbor and 16 other girls she knew from her neighborhood. She said they were taken in 10 vehicles to the military base in Dibeibat.",
      "When they arrived, Hania said she recognized more than 30 other girls from her town already there, with about 100 fighters holding them captive.",
      "She said when she tried to resist being raped, one of the militants \"started beating me with a metal whip.\" Over the next three months, she said \"the fighters came in groups of three every morning to take some girls to rape them, and then in the evening another group of three would come and take another set of girls to rape them.\"",
      "Hania said the RSF men held her and the other women and girls in a type of animal pen constructed with wire and tree branches, where they were chained up in groups of ten.",
      "\"What was clear from these cases is that in areas with RSF with control, absolutely nowhere is safe \u2013 not if you flee, or even in your home. Woman and girls are at risk of being raped no matter where,\" Wille told CBS News.",
      "Another woman, Hasina, 35, told HRW that six uniformed RSF men shot and killed her husband and stole all their cattle and money. She said the cows were her family's investment so, with them and her money stolen, she felt she had no means to flee like many of her neighbors had done, and she and her six young children, some just babies, had no choice but to stay in their home.",
      "The RSF fighters returned three days later, she said, and \"all three men raped me, and left.\"",
      "Later that evening, \"three more came back and raped me again and told me to stay in my house.\"",
      "She said she was gang-raped almost every day for the next month before she fled.",
      "HRW met Hasina at Camp Al-Hailu, a makeshift facility with little to no resources for internally displaced civilians in South Kordofan.",
      "\"She really is barely able to wake up and keep going because of what she lived through. Her kids are now in a camp with little food and looked very malnourished when I saw them. \u2026 She is struggling to function as a mother,\" said Wille, adding that women living in tents next to Hasina were helping to care for her kids.",
      "Wille said there was no psychological support for traumatized women in the camp or across much of the country.",
      "\"When I brought up the question of justice and accountability to these women, all of them looked blankly at me, as justice is a meaningless concept to them,\" she said. \"The scale with which it happens here means it's become normalized behavior by the RSF. None of these women have ever heard of a soldier or fighter ever being held accountable.\"",
      "Hania and a friend who was also pregnant managed to escape from their captors. They were interviewed by HRW in the Nuba mountains. They said 49 girls were still being held at the base and she'd heard of girls being held at two other RSF bases, as well.",
      "\"We have no way of finding out more about these women, as access is very difficult and dangerous, and in these areas there is no electricity, no cellphone networks, so no information comes out. There is an absolute silence on these abuses,\" said Wille. \"We will likely never know what happened to these women and girls.\"",
      "The International Rescue Committee charity says the humanitarian crisis driven by Sudan's civil war has been the biggest ever recorded for the second year in a row in 2024, with more than 30 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It's estimated that roughly half of Sudan's 50 million people are suffering from severe hunger.",

Mayotte is regarded as the poorest territory that falls under the sovereignty of any European Union nation, however it still draws a significant number of economic migrants from nearby nations that are even poorer, due largely to the French state welfare system being implemented there.",

    "summary": "A man from Memphis, Tenn., Bradley Dawson, has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office says.",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office said Monday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and didn't appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had denied the charge.",
      "The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.",
      "The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.",
      "An attorney for Dawson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.",
      "The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon \u2014 who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday \u2014 said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis, the organization confirmed when he was arrested. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, an idyllic South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people."

    "summary": "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands.",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands, the island's top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday.",
      "France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction.",
      "\"I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we'll get close to a thousand. Even thousands ... given the violence of this event,\" Mayotte Prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere.",
      "He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years.",
      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte, in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, is France's poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \"this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\" he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone's path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \"thoughts\" were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \"will be high,\" while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \"help the population and prevent potential looting.\"",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\"Mayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\" he said.",
      "Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding.",
      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

      "A U.N. envoy on Sunday called for a quick end to Western sanctions against Syria as the country's new leaders and regional and global powers begin to chart a path forward following the fall of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The Syrian government has been under strict sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad's brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and later spiraled into a civil war.",
      "The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and broke his iron grip on the country just days ago faces a nation wracked and deeply isolated by tough international sanctions, which compounded Syria's previous economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate Syria's rebuilding: the new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive is saddled with a terrorist designation by the U.S.",
      "The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that setting Syria back on track after the past few tumultuous weeks will be helped by a speedy relief of sanctions.",
      "\"We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around building of Syria,\" he said.",
      "Parts of Syria's biggest cities remain damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding of damaged infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution.",
      "Pedersen traveled to Damascus to meet with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that officials have been in direct contact with the group.",
      "Over the weekend, Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan where he said he secured the backing of the 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after decades of Assad family rule.",
      "They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need, and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Blinken has promised that the United States would recognize and support a new government that met those principles.",
      "A readout from President Biden's virtual call with the G7 leaders said they discussed \"the need for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition process\" amid other issues in the Middle East.",
      "With the clock on the Biden administration running out, it isn't clear what approach President-elect Donald Trump will take on Syria.",
      "Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not yet made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it.",
      "\"We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,\" Pedersen said. \"That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.\"",
      "He called for \"justice and accountability for crimes\" committed during the war and for the international community to step up humanitarian aid.",
      "In a sign of Syrians' yearning for a return to normalcy, even after the whirlwind rebel offensive of the past weeks, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital.",
      "At Nahla Zaidan school in the capital's Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government's two-starred Syrian flag.",
      "\"Syria is trying to build up this country with these children who came. Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,\" said Maysoun Al-Ali, director of the school.",
      "\"God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.\"",

Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro's government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations.",

      "What is epigenetics?",

      "The researchers investigated what happens to fat cells, which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them. (iStock)",
      "This differs from other cells in tissues, which divide much faster \u2013 intestinal cells, for example, generally divide every other week, he added.",

      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",

      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",

      "Bragg, last month, requested to Judge Juan Merchan that the case be stayed until the end of Trump\u2019s second term, but Trump attorneys noted that the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department concluded that \"the categorical prohibition on the federal indictment of a sitting president\u2026even if the case were held in abeyance\u2026applies to this situation.\"",

      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

The SmartTag uses Bluetooth for nearby tracking and relies on other Samsung devices for long-range location. Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",

      "10 THINGS YOU MUST CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING ANY SECURITY CAMERA",
      "1. Use motion-activated cameras: Install\u00a0motion-activated security cameras to monitor your decorations. Many security cameras send real-time notifications to your phone, allowing you to act quickly if someone tampers with your property.",
      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Data breaches are becoming alarmingly common, and it\u2019s no longer just massive corporations or government agencies in the crosshairs. Hackers are setting their sights on personal devices like your smartphone. Think about it, your phone holds a staggering amount of your personal information.",
      "From emails and text messages to banking apps, social media and even your photos, it's a treasure trove for cybercriminals.",
      "The numbers back up the growing threat. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 56,000 reports of personal data breaches last year. California, the most populous state, topped the charts for the most complaints, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). These stats are more than just numbers \u2014 they\u2019re a wake-up call.",

Maybe it\u2019s sluggish, overheating or making unexpected calls or texts. Your mind races: \"What did they see? What can they do with my information? Can I even fix this?\"",
      "Take a deep breath. Yes, it\u2019s unsettling, but you\u2019re not powerless. Knowing what steps to take \u2014 and in what order \u2014 can make a huge difference in regaining control and stopping the damage. Let\u2019s walk through exactly what to do if your phone gets hacked, so you can protect yourself and bounce back stronger.",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2014 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Key elements of winter testing",
      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

    "summary": "Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson tackles blockchain scams, which are often disguised as legitimate offers that promise easy investment returns.",
    "story": [
      "The \"CyberGuy\" addresses potential blockchain scams.",
      "Blockchain scams are increasingly prevalent, and it\u2019s essential to understand what they are and how to recognize them before they take a toll on your finances.",
      "For instance, John from Sunset Beach, North Carolina, recently reached out with a pressing question about some suspicious messages he\u2019s been receiving in his inbox.",
      "\"I have been receiving messages from this site for a while. Can you tell me if this is a scam or real? I don't want to pay good money to get scammed.\"",
      "Cryptocurrency scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "John's experience is not unique; many individuals find themselves in similar situations when confronted with potential blockchain scams. These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",
      "A man holding cryptocurrency coins (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Scammer tactics: How they get your info",
      "Now, you might be wondering, \"How did these scammers get my info in the first place?\" Great question. Let\u2019s take a quick look at how they manage to dig up your personal details \u2013 more than likely through the shady world of data harvesting.",
      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

      "In the early hours of October 7, 2023, the Idan family of Kibbutz Nahal Oz was shattered when Hamas terrorists infiltrated their home. As the family tried to take refuge in their safe room, the terrorists murdered their eldest daughter, Maayan, in front of her parents and siblings, and then abducted the father, Tzachi. The scene was broadcast live on social media, forcing the nation to witness their agonizing last moments.",
      "At the same time, in Kibbutz Holit, 16-year-old Rotem Matias lay hiding under his mother's lifeless body, texting his sisters the heartbreaking news: \"Mom and Dad are dead. Sorry.\"",
      "In Kfar Aza, Roee Idan was killed while holding his 3-year-old daughter, Abigail, as his older children watched in horror. Their mother, Smadar, was also shot before their eyes.

      "These are just a few of the countless stories documented in a new report released on Tuesday, co-authored by Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, founder of the Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes Against Women and Children, and Dr. Michal Gilad and Dr. Ilya Rudyak. The report introduces the term \"kinocide\" to describe the systematic targeting and destruction of family units during the attack-\u00a0an unprecedented atrocity that goes beyond typical warfare.",
      "\"A crime without a name for victims without a voice,\" as Dr. Elkayam-Levy described it. \"The perpetrators not only killed but deliberately sought to destroy the very foundation of human society: the family.\"",
      "\"The hardest crimes to witness were those involving families,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy continued, \"While the Hamas perpetrators celebrated their violence, chanting religious slogans and broadcasting their actions on social media, the terror was not confined to the immediate victims-it was amplified globally.\"",
      "\"The use of social media was crucial in spreading the terror, inspiring similar acts of violence elsewhere,\" Merav Israeli-Amarant, CEO of the Civil Commission, told Fox News Digital. She referred to this tactic as the \"terror filter,\" a term coined by legal scholar Tehila Schwartz Altshuler, explaining how the broadcasts were designed to radicalize and incite other terrorists.",

      "As Elkayam-Levy and her team dug deeper, they realized that similar tactics have been documented in conflicts across the globe, from Argentina and Iraq to Syria, Sierra Leone and Myanmar. \"We\u2019ve been in contact with survivors of kinocide, including Yazidis, who have shared their experiences. The pain is universal. This has happened before, but it never had a name,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy said.",
      "In collaboration with the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, the commission worked to identify these patterns of abuse and ensure that kinocide is recognized as a distinct crime. The new report, released after a year of research, includes interviews with survivors, visits to the sites where the atrocities took place, and an extensive review of evidence. The goal is to bring kinocide into international legal discourse, advocating for its urgent need to be recognized as a distinct crime.",

      "Professor Irwin Cotler, former Minister of Justice of Canada and International Chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, stated, \"Silence in the face of such evil is not neutrality; it is complicity. Worse still, there has been denial, justification, and even the glorification of these heinous acts, underscoring the moral and legal imperative to act decisively against such crimes. The dangers of antisemitism are not just the oldest and most lethal of hatreds- they are also a presage of global evil, as evidenced by the events of October 7.\"",
      "\"We need an international coalition to address this systematic targeting of families,\" Elkayam-Levy said. \"But international law has failed the survivors of October 7. The current legal frameworks do not adequately protect families in these kinds of attacks.\"",

      "The report, which has been endorsed by international law experts and human rights activists worldwide, highlights the urgent need for legal and social recognition of kinocide.

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation from Justin Trudeau&apos;s Cabinet on Monday, a powerful blow to the Liberal Prime Minister&apos;s hold on the government.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, announced Monday that she was resigning from the Cabinet.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years can stay on in his role as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trudeau's popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration.",
      "Opposition leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party Trudeau's ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called on Trudeau to resign. The main opposition Conservatives demanded an election.",
      "Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only \"honest and viable path\" was to leave the Cabinet.",
      "CANADIAN PREMIER THREATENS TO CUT OFF ENERGY IMPORTS TO US IF TRUMP IMPOSES TARIFF ON COUNTRY",
      "\"For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\" Freeland said.",
      "Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \"costly political gimmicks\" it can \"ill afford.\"",
      "\"Our country is facing a grave challenge,\" Freeland said in the letter. \"That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\"",
      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated trade with the U.S.",
      "The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland delivers remarks on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2024. (Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)",
      "Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but some party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure came as strong blow to Trudeau's administration.",
      "\"This news has hit me really hard,\" Transport Minister Anita Anand said, adding that she needed to digest the news before commenting further.",
      "Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time.",
      "\"Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he's hanging onto power,\" Poilievre said. \"All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closest ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.\"",
      "No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.",
      "The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don\u2019t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time.",
      "\"I\u2019m calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. He has to go,\" NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said.",
      "Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party needs the support of the NDP party to stay in power. Singh didn't say if he would note no confidence in the government but said all options are on the table.",
      "\"Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government is over,\" Opposition Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said. \"He must acknowledge that and act accordingly. The departure of his most important ally, his finance minister, is the end of this government.\"",
      "Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country\u2019s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"As a country we have to project strength,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \"It\u2019s chaos right now up in Ottawa.\"",
      "Trudeau\u2019s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change.",
      "Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians \"know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.\"",
      "Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada.",
      "He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet.",
      "\"This is quite a bombshell,\" said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. \"Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau\u2019s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.\"",
      "Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister\u2019s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland\u2019s status questionable.",
      "\"There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,\" Wiseman said.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government.",
      "\"Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government\u2019s fall economic statement,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It\u2019s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.\""

      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan\u00a0Fidan, who was the former head of the country\u2019s formidable intelligence service, MIT, said on Sunday in Jordan about his country\u2019s view of the Kurdish political and military organizations, Kurdistan Workers' Party\u00a0(PKK) and The People's Defense Units (YPG):\u00a0\"We are under threat from Iraq and Syria. Over the past decade, the PKK has sought to exploit the chaos in Syria, attempting to restructure itself within the SDF organization. We continue to combat PKK/YPG terrorism, targeting them wherever they are.\"",
      "He added, \"Our aim is to distinguish the Syrian Kurds from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG. We support the legitimate representatives of Syrian Kurds in their efforts to advocate for their rights in Damascus.\"",
      "The YPG is the main U.S.-allied force that contributed to the defeat of ISIS. The U.S. classified the PKK as a foreign terrorist organization. The YPG falls under the rubric of the Syrian Kurdish organization, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF.)",

Abraham Hamadeh, R-Ariz., whose parents are Syrian immigrants, told Fox News Digital, \"As we evaluate Turkey\u2019s recent airstrikes on Syrian Kurds and reports of Hamas operatives in Turkey, it\u2019s clear that our alliances must be anchored in mutual respect and shared goals. For decades, Turkey has been a strategic partner, but hosting groups like Hamas without clear steps toward dismantling their operations undermines that relationship. Turkey must seize this opportunity to demonstrate it is committed to fighting terror, not enabling it.\"",

Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the main U.S. ally whose fighters are currently guarding 45,000 ISIS militants and their families at camps and prisons in Eastern Syria, said the Turkish military and its allied forces continue to attack his Kurdish forces, despite a U.S. brokered ceasefire deal Wednesday.",
      "\"We are still under constant attack from the Turkish military and the Turkish-supported opposition which is called SNA,\" Gen. Mazloum told Fox. \"Eighty drone attacks a day we have from the Turkish military. There is intensive artillery shells. This situation has paralyzed our counterterror operation.\"",

    "summary": "One man's journey from a hospital in South Carolina to NovaShare, a body broker in North Carolina, demonstrates the peril of an industry with little regulation.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "CORNELIUS, N.C. \u2014 Last year, Karen Wandel received an alarming message: Her father had died more than five months earlier in a South Carolina hospital and, when no family claimed his body, the hospital sent it to be used for medical research.",
      "Wandel had a strained relationship with her father, Libero Marinelli Jr., a widower, and hadn\u2019t spoken to him in years. But as a lawyer in North Carolina, she wasn\u2019t hard to find. Neither were Marinelli\u2019s brother in California or sister in Massachusetts, who had kept in touch on birthdays and holidays. But they all learned of his death only after Marinelli\u2019s brother sent him a Christmas card that was returned unopened.",
      "Wandel remains stunned by the treatment of her father, who, as a former Army service member, was entitled to be buried in a veterans\u2019 cemetery but whose corpse instead was first sent to a body broker in another state.",
      "\u201cI just want somebody to look me in the eye and say, \u2018What we did was wrong, and we are sorry. We are sorry to your family, and we\u2019re sorry that your father suffered this indignity,\u2019\u201d Wandel said. \u201cParticularly after he served his country.\u201d",
      "Supplying unclaimed bodies for medical research is widely considered unethical, and most major medical schools \u2014 and a few states \u2014 have halted the practice. And yet it continues, in part due to the health care industry\u2019s steady demand for human specimens and local officials\u2019 feeling overwhelmed by a rise in bodies without next of kin to claim them.",
      "What\u2019s difficult to gauge is just how often it occurs: The body business has no federal regulation or oversight, and many states do not track the practice.",
      "NBC News spent months documenting the use of unclaimed bodies in medical research, submitting public records requests to dozens of state agencies, county coroners and medical schools. The records offer glimpses of where and how this is occurring.",
      "Since 2020, a community college in North Carolina has received 43 unclaimed bodies from local welfare agencies and medical examiners to teach embalming to funeral services students. In Pennsylvania, a state body-donation program that distributes human remains to medical schools said that it had received 58 unclaimed bodies from county coroners, medical examiners, hospitals and other facilities since 2019. Louisiana State University provided records on a single 2023 case in which an unclaimed car wreck victim was sent to the school\u2019s forensic department for study; a university spokesperson said the lab prioritizes \u201cethical practices and respect for the dignity of individuals.\u201d",
      "But in many states where it is legal to use unclaimed bodies for medical research, officials told NBC News that they did not have records of any such cases or denied requests for detailed information. That included Pennsylvania, where an official said the body-donation program could not share how the 58 unclaimed bodies were used. In Illinois, a 2018 law requires record-keeping of the unclaimed bodies provided to medical institutions, but a spokesperson for the state agency responsible for the task said it is not doing it because no one allocated any money for the effort.",
      "\u201cThere could be a lot more happening that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Joy Balta, an anatomy professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in California. He wants to see more regulation of the body donation industry and has written guidelines that call for donation programs to stop using unclaimed bodies. Otherwise, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know about it.\u201d",
      "The most extensive use of the unclaimed dead that reporters found was at a Fort Worth-based medical school, the University of North Texas Health Science Center. NBC News reported this year that the center collected thousands of unclaimed bodies from county medical examiners and leased some out to private companies and the Army, often without consent from any next of kin. The center halted the use of unclaimed bodies in response to NBC News\u2019 reporting, citing failures of \u201crespect, care and professionalism.\u201d",
      "In the absence of regulations, many coroners, hospitals or nursing homes are left to decide for themselves what to do when people die without a relative available to arrange a funeral. For some, the easiest \u2014 and cheapest \u2014 solution is to donate the body to a medical school or a body dealer, even if there is no indication that is what the person or their next of kin wanted.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s journey from a public hospital to a for-profit body broker demonstrates the peril of this choice: Health care workers and local authorities often lack the time and expertise to find people\u2019s relatives, NBC News has found, and when they fail to do so, families are denied the chance to decide what happens to their loved one\u2019s remains.",
      "Once she learned of her father\u2019s death, Wandel began to seek answers, growing angrier at each step.",
      "\u201cIf they could do this to a veteran Army officer, a guy with a house, a guy with a dog, a guy with family,\u201d she said, \u201cimagine what could happen to really vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "Wandel acknowledges that her father was a difficult man.",
      "Marinelli grew up in New Jersey, joined the Army, attended law school and served several years as a military lawyer during the Vietnam War. He told his daughter that an assignment representing a soldier who had fired on his own unit nearly broke him, and sparked a drinking habit that developed into alcoholism. He went on to work at the Justice Department\u2019s tax division, but lost his job and went into private practice, Wandel said.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s wife, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, also suffered from addiction, and from mental illness, Wandel said. They separated but did not divorce. Neither was able to properly care for Wandel, their only child, so she spent much of her childhood in foster care but stayed in touch with her parents.",
      "For years, Marinelli tried to clean up and get his daughter back but couldn\u2019t make it stick, Wandel said. Still, he taught her to swim, ride a bike and drive. He took her to folk and bluegrass concerts. He attended her graduations from high school, college and law school, and walked her down the aisle at her wedding.",
      "In 2009, after Wandel\u2019s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she returned to her and slept by her bedside until she died. She and her father later fought over his refusal to help administer her mother\u2019s affairs, Wandel said, and, in 2011, they stopped talking.",
      "Caring for her mother inspired Wandel to volunteer at a hospice. \u201cI found the idea of people dying without dignity or without somebody there to listen to them and hold their hand really offensive,\u201d she said.",
      "If she had known her father was dying, she said, \u201cI would have been there.\u201d"

      "Late one Monday evening back in July after most senators had already gone home for the day, a unanimous motion passed the Senate to slip the formal national bird designation into the U.S. code.",
      "\u201cWithout objection, it is so ordered,\u201d Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., moved to pass the bill with no one else in the chamber.",
      "Just like that, it was off to the House.",
      "The U.S. code already designates the oak tree as the national tree of the United States and the rose as the national flower, and Congress even voted in 2016 to deem the bison the national mammal, but the bald eagle is not the national bird of the U.S. \u2014 yet.",
      "Thanks to one man who discovered the omission, Congress is about to correct that. The House passed the bill Monday night, sending it to President Joe Biden to sign into law and formalize the bald eagle's national significance in one of Congress\u2019 last acts of the year.",
      "The 'eaglevangelist'",
      "The bald eagle is a particular passion in Wabasha, Minnesota, where the National Eagle Center sits on the bank of the Mississippi River. The self-designated \u201cEagle Capital of America,\u201d the city has a population of about 1,500 people, including one person who has dedicated his life to the bald eagle\u2019s legacy.",
      "Preston Cook is, to put it mildly, obsessed with bald eagles.",
      "\u201cI saw a movie called \u2018A Thousand Clowns\u2019 in 1966 and there was one line in the movie, \u2018You can\u2019t have too many eagles,\u2019\u201d Cook said. \u201cI walked out of the theater and I said that might be an interesting thing to collect.\u201d",
      "So, he started collecting and collecting and collecting. Over the decades, Cook\u2019s trove has ballooned to over 40,000 items, a collection that he believes is the largest in the country.",
      "\u201cIf it had an eagle on it, I\u2019d buy it,\u201d Cook said, \u201cI may have gotten a little carried away in my collecting here, but I\u2019ve loved the whole process.\u201d",
      "The collection lives in two warehouses just steps from the Mississippi River and ranges from political pins to paintings and magazine covers to playing cards. There are lego sets and sculptures, ginger beer bottles and eagle bedazzled stilettos.",
      "The collection became so big that Cook began looking for a place to put it. It found a home in the National Eagle Center in Wabasha.",
      "He also decided to turn his collection into a book, and while researching the eagle\u2019s place in American history, he came to a realization.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a national bird,\u201d Cook said.",
      "The turkey myth",
      "The omission came as a shock to the staff at the National Eagle Center, who thought the honor had already been bestowed on the bird that nests in the trees surrounding their headquarters. Minnesota has the second-largest nesting population of bald eagles in the country, trailing only Alaska.",
      "\u201cPreston Cook brought that up to us years ago, and it was like, \u2018Oh, come on, you\u2019re kidding me,\u2019\u201d said Scott Mehus, the education director at the National Eagle Center. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking in classes all of these years, telling [people] it\u2019s our nation\u2019s symbol and our national bird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong all these years and so has everybody else in the country,\u201d Mehus said.",
      "The bald eagle became the nation\u2019s most prominent bird when it was placed on the great seal shortly after the country\u2019s founding. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who were originally tasked with the responsibility, were unable to agree to a seal to represent the country, so in 1782, Secretary of the Continental Congress Charles Thomson submitted a version with the bald eagle, which was approved later that year. The eagle-emblazoned seal was first used on a document authorizing George Washington to negotiate a prisoner-of-war exchange and has been a national symbol since.",
      "But not all of the Founding Fathers were fans of the eagle. Franklin famously wrote in a letter to his daughter that he wished the eagle had not been chosen as the representative for the United States, calling it \u201ca bird of bad moral character\u201d and adding, \u201cHe does not get his living honestly.\u201d",
      "Franklin went on to say in his letter that \u201cthe Turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original Native of America.\u201d",
      "But it's a myth that Franklin led discussions about making the turkey the national bird; historians believe he was joking. \u201cHe never advocated for the turkey to be our great seal,\u201d Scott said, though he admitted Franklin made some negative comments about the eagle.",
      "The bill",
      "\u201cThis is one of those few laws that\u2019s going to make no difference,\u201d Cook jokes.",
      "The bill Cook himself initially wrote and sent to Congress has no money attached to it; it doesn\u2019t even assist in conservation efforts related to bald eagles. It simply slips a line into the U.S. code between the national tree and the guidelines for inaugural ceremonies that says, \u201cThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the national bird.\u201d",
      "He sent the bill to the offices of Minnesota lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, and a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., brought it to the floor to be passed unanimously in the upper chamber.",
      "\u201cThey are the ones that came to us and said it\u2019s not the national bird,\u201d Klobuchar said of the National Eagle Center and Cook. \u201cSo that was the impetus.\u201d",
      "It takes an act of Congress and the president's signature to designate any item with the \u201cnational\u201d title; the rose got the honor in 1986 and the oak tree in 2004.",
      "\u201cNo one has to change anything; it\u2019s just a correction. It is only a correction in history to make things right and makes things the way they should be,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was one of those little pieces of history that I felt should be taken care of, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "The blazer",
      "Cook doesn\u2019t literally wear his passion for eagles on his sleeve, but it\u2019s close. He wears a bow tie embroidered with an eagle and an eagle pin on his lapel, and eagles even fly on his red, white and blue suspenders.",
      "When you ask him what his most prized eagle possession is, he points to the buttons he received when he was drafted into the Army in the 1960s, which are now sewn onto the blue blazer he wears often.",
      "\u201cI was issued these buttons on my dress uniform that has the great seal. Two years later, I got out, snipped the buttons off my military uniform, and I\u2019ve been wearing them ever since,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the first items in my collection, and that gave me a start on collecting eagles for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "He looks at tables covered with old magazine covers showing caricatures of eagles flying away with small children in their talons and admits he hasn\u2019t stopped gathering items, calling it \u201ca working collection.\u201d He cycles the items through exhibits for children and interested visitors to look at in the National Eagle Center, but jokes: \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife that I\u2019m still collecting.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy wife has been very tolerant, and I appreciate her for that,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, she will say, \u2018You have too many eagles.\u2019 Occasionally, she\u2019ll say that.\u201d",
      "But just like legislating, marriage is about compromise, and even Cook\u2019s household has its limits.",
      "\u201cShe says, \u2018You can put them wherever you want in the house, but you cannot put them in the bedroom,\u2019\u201d Cook said with a laugh. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I can live with that one.\u2019\u201d"

      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

About 100 tips required further review, the agencies said.",
      "\"We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast,\" the agencies said in the joint statement. \"That said, we recognize the concern among many communities.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI has held classified briefings warning a handful of U.S. lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party is working to create fake stories to portray them in a negative light because of their hawkish views of Beijing and support for Taiwan, two U.S. officials familiar with the briefings told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the briefings, said that one of the false stories being concocted by the CCP, cited by FBI briefers, is that these lawmakers are espousing pro-Taiwan views because they were taking \u201cbribes\u201d from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cThe CCP is trying to undermine congressional support for Taiwan\u2019s democracy, to paint it as corrupt and not in the American public interest,\u201d one of the two U.S. officials told NBC News. \u201cIt will not work.\u201d",
      "The officials said the briefings occurred in the fall.",
      "A third source, a House lawmaker who specializes in national security matters, said they had been informed about the alleged CCP scheme but had not personally received a briefing.",
      "The FBI had no comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment about this story.",
      "The classified discussions were described as \u201cdefensive\u201d briefings, the U.S. officials said, meaning the alleged CCP scheme had not been carried out yet, but the FBI wanted to share critical information with the intended targets as a way to pre-empt the attacks.",
      "The FBI commonly provides defensive briefings to senior officials when the bureau learns they have been targeted by foreign intelligence operations.",
      "Tensions between Beijing and Washington have escalated in recent years, particularly over the future of the island of Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy and a critical U.S. ally in Asia that China claims as its territory.",
      "In 2022, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of China\u2019s human rights violations, made an unannounced visit to Taiwan and was awarded the highest civilian honor by its president. She was the highest-ranking U.S. official to set foot in Taiwan since former Speaker Newt Gingrich did it in 1997, and the move infuriated officials in Beijing, which launched military exercises around Taiwan including live-fire drills.",
      "Other lawmakers have made similar trips to Taipei. In February, bipartisan members of the special House committee investigating the CCP traveled to Taiwan to congratulate Lai Ching-te, the pro-independence candidate who had been elected president just weeks earlier. And this past May, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a bipartisan group of six lawmakers on an official congressional visit to Taiwan to meet with Lai.",
      "Several members of the House Intelligence Committee and select House committee on the CCP declined to comment when asked if they had received a classified briefing on the matter. Lawmakers are prohibited from speaking publicly about any such classified briefings.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., the chairman of the select House committee on the CCP, had no comment about any specific plot by the CCP, but said it was no secret Beijing has been targeting U.S. officials and other Americans.",
      "\u201cThe CCP will try to discredit our way of life, our freedoms and will use every means necessary,\u201d Moolenaar told NBC News. \u201cSo you know, whether it\u2019s hacking high-level officials\u2019 communications, we can expect all these things.\u201d",
      "Starting with the 2022 midterm elections, China has adopted increasingly sophisticated and aggressive tactics to try to aggravate political divisions in American society and undermine congressional candidates that Beijing deems hostile to the regime\u2019s interests, especially over the status of Taiwan, according to U.S. intelligence officials and researchers.",
      "In the 2024 presidential contest, China did not appear to favor either candidate but instead focused on specific downballot races with covert disinformation campaigns, using artificial intelligence tools and fake accounts mimicking Americans. The candidates targeted included McCaul; Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala.; and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., according to an analysis from Microsoft.\u00a0A Chinese Embassy spokesperson said at the time that the claims were \"full of malicious speculations\" and that China had \"no intention\" to and would \"not interfere in the U.S. election.\"",
      "U.S. intelligence officials and analysts say China\u2019s efforts to stoke polarization and undercut Americans\u2019 confidence in the democratic process are part of a long-term effort that includes global information operations designed to tarnish America\u2019s image abroad.",
      "China\u2019s disinformation efforts have coincided with what U.S. officials say is a concerted effort to steal intellectual property and U.S. military secrets through espionage and cyber hacks.",
      "Earlier this month, the White House said that a Chinese hacking campaign targeting the U.S. and other countries was more sweeping and serious than previously known. The CCP had spied on the texts and calls of U.S. citizens by hacking at least eight American telecommunications companies, according to a White House official.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington responded to that allegation in a statement this month: \u201cChina firmly opposes the US\u2019s smear attacks against China without any factual basis.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe USDA should act with urgency to require state-issued benefit cards to be protected by industry-standard payment security defenses,\u201d read the letter, which was sent Monday evening and first shared with NBC News. It was signed by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., John Fetterman, D-Pa., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Peter Welch, D-Vt., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.",
      "SNAP is a far-reaching public benefits program that helps over 42 million people nationwide purchase fruit, vegetables and other groceries, according to the Agriculture Department, which oversees SNAP. The program, which used to be referred to as food stamps, provides participants with electronic benefits transfer cards that have magnetic stripes that are swiped at card-reading machines.",
      "But unlike consumer credit and debit cards, SNAP EBT cards lack security features such as microchips or tap-to-pay technology. That makes them particularly vulnerable to \u201cskimming\u201d \u2014 a form of electronic theft that occurs when criminals hide devices in payment terminals and clone card information, including users\u2019 PINs. (See a picture of skimming overlays here.) The thieves then copy the information onto fake cards, which they use to drain SNAP participants\u2019 benefits.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that hackers and scam artists are stealing food benefits that low-income families rely on to put food on the table,\u201d Wyden said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cOur government cannot keep stalling on requiring protections against thieves who are ripping away families\u2019 benefits and leaving them without any money to pay for groceries.\u201d",
      "No state offers EBT cards with microchip protection yet, and only a small number have timetables for the transition to chip-embedded cards. California, set to start rolling them out in early 2025, is the furthest along, an Agriculture Department spokesperson said. Alabama and Oklahoma are scheduled to switch to chip cards next summer, though Alabama could implement them as soon as the spring, according to spokespeople for the agencies that administer SNAP in those states.",
      "Advocates say it\u2019s imperative that the Agriculture Department require more secure cards nationwide as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cThe households being affected are victims of crime,\u201d said Betsy Gwin, a senior economic justice attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, a nonprofit poverty law and policy center.",
      "\u201cIt continues to be extremely heartbreaking to hear from families who are doing what they can to protect themselves yet continue to be at risk and end up in a grocery store checkout line with a cart full of groceries only to discover that their benefits for that month have been stolen and they don\u2019t have the ability to provide food for their family,\u201d she said.",
      "The senators\u2019 letter called on the Agriculture Department to \u201cswiftly finalize\u201d the proposed rule for EBT card security measures that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 required it to work on.",
      "\u201cWhile the innovation of the private sector and the leadership of certain states in this space is commendable, the urgency of this issue demands a concerted federal effort,\u201d the senators wrote.",
      "Vilsack last month encouraged all governors to adopt new EBT standards for cardholders in their states. In a statement to NBC News before it received the letter, the Agriculture Department said rulemaking regarding EBT card security measures is \u201congoing and expected in calendar year 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur current regulations do not prohibit states from moving forward with implementing chip cards before this rulemaking takes place,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Reimbursements at risk",
      "The senators\u2019 letter comes at a crucial time: just days before the policy that has allowed states to use federal funds to reimburse SNAP participants for some stolen benefits is set to expire.",
      "Only a handful of states reinstate skimmed SNAP dollars using state funds, and unless Congress acts soon, federal funds will no longer be authorized to reimburse those who become victims of EBT theft after Friday \u2014 meaning most who are robbed of their grocery funds would not get them back.",
      "Those fighting food insecurity have appealed to Congress to extend federal SNAP replacement benefits in the end-of-year spending package.",
      "\u201cIt is unconscionable that some in Congress would stand in the way of providing SNAP replacement benefits to those who have been victims of fraud,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, interim president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy organization, said in a statement over the weekend.",
      "The senators\u2019 letter said stolen benefits will continue to be a problem unless the Agriculture Department removes the requirement that SNAP EBT cards have \u201coutdated and insecure\u201d magnetic stripes and instead require chip cards within the next couple of years.",
      "\u201cReplacing stolen benefits, while critical, is not a sustainable solution,\u201d the letter said. \u201cRapidly issuing the proposed rule to modernize EBT technology will reduce fraud, enhance consumer protections, and ultimately save taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "Wyden introduced a bill in March that would direct the Agriculture Department to issue updated cybersecurity regulations for SNAP EBT cards for the first time since 2010 and phase out magnetic stripe cards within five years. The bill has yet to advance.",
      "Fetterman, a co-sponsor on Wyden\u2019s bill, said in a statement to NBC News on Monday that low-income families should not have to worry about losing their benefits \u201cbecause the system hasn\u2019t kept up with basic security standards.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongress directed USDA to modernize these cards to protect families exposed to unnecessary risks of fraud and theft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on the USDA to stop dragging their feet and modernize EBT cards with the same technology we\u2019ve used for years on credit and debit cards.\u201d"

      "Fourteen Democratic senators will introduce an amendment Monday evening to remove language from Congress\u2019 massive defense spending bill that seeks to ban coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender children of service members, the office of Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., told NBC News.",
      "The 1,800-page National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed the House last week by a vote of 281-140, with 200 Republicans and 81 Democrats voting \u201cyes,\u201d and 124 Democrats and 16 Republicans voting \u201cno.\u201d The $895 billion bill authorizes the annual budget for the Defense Department and sets defense policies for the upcoming year.",
      "The group of 14 senators, led by Baldwin \u2014 who will be the Senate\u2019s sole LGBTQ member in the new term \u2014 is seeking to remove a provision tucked into the bill that would prohibit \u201cmedical treatment for military dependents under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria\u201d under the military\u2019s health care program, Tricare.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: we\u2019re talking about parents who are in uniform serving our country who have earned the right to make the best decisions for their families. I trust our servicemembers and their doctors to make the best healthcare decisions for their kids, not politicians,\u201d Baldwin said in a statement. \u201cOur amendment would protect military families\u2019 right to make their own decisions and access sometimes lifesaving care for their children.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed publicly and behind the scenes for the provision to be added into the defense spending bill, which was negotiated by senior House and Senate leaders from both parties. In a statement following the House vote last week, Johnson said the legislation prioritizes \u201cmilitary lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.\u201d",
      "If the amendment remains in the NDAA, it would mark one of the first times Congress passed a federal statute directed at trans people. President Joe Biden will either sign or veto the bill if it passes the Senate, which is scheduled to vote on it this week before leaving Washington for the rest of the year; the NDAA must pass before Jan. 1.",
      "A draft of a media release shared with NBC News \u2014 and scheduled to be made public Monday evening \u2014 from Baldwin\u2019s office said that if the transgender health care provision survives, it could affect 6,000 to 7,000 children of U.S. service members. Modern Military Association of America, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ members of the military and veterans, estimates that there are roughly 10,000 trans youths between 6 and 22 with parents who are active military.",
      "In recent weeks, Congress has repeatedly quarreled over the rights of transgender people, who make up just 0.5% of all Americans above age 18, according to the Williams Institute. With the election of Congress\u2019 first transgender member, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, D- Del., House Republicans have introduced a measure to bar trans people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities in the Capitol complex. Some Democrats have also been fighting with one another over whether the party\u2019s stance on trans rights played a role in Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 election loss.",
      "The amendment to remove the trans health provision from the defense bill will be co-sponsored by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, according to a statement from Baldwin\u2019s office."

    "title": "Americans can now visit China for up to 10 days without a visa",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:07:33 GMT",
    "summary": "China said Tuesday it was expanding its visa-free transit policy, allowing eligible foreign travelers to stay in parts of the country as long as 10 days.",
    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it was expanding its visa-free transit policy, allowing Americans and other eligible foreign travelers to stay in parts of the country as long as 240 hours, or 10 days, as officials try to attract more overseas visitors.",
      "China\u2019s National Immigration Agency announced the measure, which is effective immediately, on its WeChat account, saying passport holders from 54 countries are eligible. They include countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia, as well as the United States and Canada.",
      "Previously, travelers could stay in China visa-free for as long as 72 to 144 hours depending on where they visited, as long as they continued on to a third country or region.",
      "Travelers with confirmed tickets to exit China within 10 days can enter the country in 60 places across 24 provinces, including the capital, Beijing, and China\u2019s largest city, Shanghai. The expanded scheme also allows transit visitors to travel across regions during the 10 days, with some restrictions.",
      "Visa waivers for transit passengers are popular among travelers, including Americans, who might otherwise be required to go through a tedious visa process for travel to China or elsewhere.",
      "China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, has been trying to bring back international visitors as it struggles to emerge from three years of pandemic isolation, steadily easing its visa policies in recent months.",
      "Passport holders from 38 countries no longer need a visa at all, enabling them to stay in China for up to 30 days for business, tourism, family visits, exchange and transit purposes. Those countries include France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and even Japan, with which China has a historically tense relationship, but not the U.S.",
      "The immigration agency said in October that the number of foreign travelers to China had jumped nearly 50% year-on-year, while the number of visa-free entries was up almost 80%.",
      "Last month the State Department lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3, advising Americans to reconsider travel, to Level 2, or \u201cexercise increased caution,\u201d putting it on par with the travel advisories for France and Germany.",
      "The move was prompted by the Biden administration\u2019s announcement that it had secured the release of three Americans who had been detained in China for years.",
      "The Level 3 advisory, the second-highest level, had warned about \u201cthe risk of wrongful detentions\u201d in China, where there are more Americans detained than in any other foreign country, according to the Dui Hua Foundation, an advocacy group.",
      "Two of the three Americans officially classified by the State Department as wrongfully detained, Kai Li and Mark Swidan, were among those released in November. The third, David Lin, was freed in September after almost 20 years in detention.",
      "The language about wrongful detentions has been removed in the updated advisory, though it still warns of \u201carbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.\u201d",
      "Beijing said it hoped the updated U.S. advisory would promote academic and other exchanges between the two countries, which have fallen off dramatically amid pandemic restrictions and geopolitical tensions."

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "One man's journey from a hospital in South Carolina to NovaShare, a body broker in North Carolina, demonstrates the peril of an industry with little regulation.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "CORNELIUS, N.C. \u2014 Last year, Karen Wandel received an alarming message: Her father had died more than five months earlier in a South Carolina hospital and, when no family claimed his body, the hospital sent it to be used for medical research.",
      "Wandel had a strained relationship with her father, Libero Marinelli Jr., a widower, and hadn\u2019t spoken to him in years. But as a lawyer in North Carolina, she wasn\u2019t hard to find. Neither were Marinelli\u2019s brother in California or sister in Massachusetts, who had kept in touch on birthdays and holidays. But they all learned of his death only after Marinelli\u2019s brother sent him a Christmas card that was returned unopened.",
      "Wandel remains stunned by the treatment of her father, who, as a former Army service member, was entitled to be buried in a veterans\u2019 cemetery but whose corpse instead was first sent to a body broker in another state.",
      "\u201cI just want somebody to look me in the eye and say, \u2018What we did was wrong, and we are sorry. We are sorry to your family, and we\u2019re sorry that your father suffered this indignity,\u2019\u201d Wandel said. \u201cParticularly after he served his country.\u201d",
      "Supplying unclaimed bodies for medical research is widely considered unethical, and most major medical schools \u2014 and a few states \u2014 have halted the practice. And yet it continues, in part due to the health care industry\u2019s steady demand for human specimens and local officials\u2019 feeling overwhelmed by a rise in bodies without next of kin to claim them.",
      "What\u2019s difficult to gauge is just how often it occurs: The body business has no federal regulation or oversight, and many states do not track the practice.",
      "NBC News spent months documenting the use of unclaimed bodies in medical research, submitting public records requests to dozens of state agencies, county coroners and medical schools. The records offer glimpses of where and how this is occurring.",
      "Since 2020, a community college in North Carolina has received 43 unclaimed bodies from local welfare agencies and medical examiners to teach embalming to funeral services students. In Pennsylvania, a state body-donation program that distributes human remains to medical schools said that it had received 58 unclaimed bodies from county coroners, medical examiners, hospitals and other facilities since 2019. Louisiana State University provided records on a single 2023 case in which an unclaimed car wreck victim was sent to the school\u2019s forensic department for study; a university spokesperson said the lab prioritizes \u201cethical practices and respect for the dignity of individuals.\u201d",
      "But in many states where it is legal to use unclaimed bodies for medical research, officials told NBC News that they did not have records of any such cases or denied requests for detailed information. That included Pennsylvania, where an official said the body-donation program could not share how the 58 unclaimed bodies were used. In Illinois, a 2018 law requires record-keeping of the unclaimed bodies provided to medical institutions, but a spokesperson for the state agency responsible for the task said it is not doing it because no one allocated any money for the effort.",
      "\u201cThere could be a lot more happening that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Joy Balta, an anatomy professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in California. He wants to see more regulation of the body donation industry and has written guidelines that call for donation programs to stop using unclaimed bodies. Otherwise, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know about it.\u201d",
      "The most extensive use of the unclaimed dead that reporters found was at a Fort Worth-based medical school, the University of North Texas Health Science Center. NBC News reported this year that the center collected thousands of unclaimed bodies from county medical examiners and leased some out to private companies and the Army, often without consent from any next of kin. The center halted the use of unclaimed bodies in response to NBC News\u2019 reporting, citing failures of \u201crespect, care and professionalism.\u201d",
      "In the absence of regulations, many coroners, hospitals or nursing homes are left to decide for themselves what to do when people die without a relative available to arrange a funeral. For some, the easiest \u2014 and cheapest \u2014 solution is to donate the body to a medical school or a body dealer, even if there is no indication that is what the person or their next of kin wanted.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s journey from a public hospital to a for-profit body broker demonstrates the peril of this choice: Health care workers and local authorities often lack the time and expertise to find people\u2019s relatives, NBC News has found, and when they fail to do so, families are denied the chance to decide what happens to their loved one\u2019s remains.",
      "Once she learned of her father\u2019s death, Wandel began to seek answers, growing angrier at each step.",
      "\u201cIf they could do this to a veteran Army officer, a guy with a house, a guy with a dog, a guy with family,\u201d she said, \u201cimagine what could happen to really vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "Wandel acknowledges that her father was a difficult man.",
      "Marinelli grew up in New Jersey, joined the Army, attended law school and served several years as a military lawyer during the Vietnam War. He told his daughter that an assignment representing a soldier who had fired on his own unit nearly broke him, and sparked a drinking habit that developed into alcoholism. He went on to work at the Justice Department\u2019s tax division, but lost his job and went into private practice, Wandel said.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s wife, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, also suffered from addiction, and from mental illness, Wandel said. They separated but did not divorce. Neither was able to properly care for Wandel, their only child, so she spent much of her childhood in foster care but stayed in touch with her parents.",
      "For years, Marinelli tried to clean up and get his daughter back but couldn\u2019t make it stick, Wandel said. Still, he taught her to swim, ride a bike and drive. He took her to folk and bluegrass concerts. He attended her graduations from high school, college and law school, and walked her down the aisle at her wedding.",
      "In 2009, after Wandel\u2019s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she returned to her and slept by her bedside until she died. She and her father later fought over his refusal to help administer her mother\u2019s affairs, Wandel said, and, in 2011, they stopped talking.",
      "Caring for her mother inspired Wandel to volunteer at a hospice. \u201cI found the idea of people dying without dignity or without somebody there to listen to them and hold their hand really offensive,\u201d she said.",
      "If she had known her father was dying, she said, \u201cI would have been there.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. Agriculture Department must take immediate action to secure the grocery benefits cards from which low-income families are being robbed, six Democratic senators urged.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department must take immediate action to secure the benefits cards from which low-income families are being robbed of grocery funds, six Democratic senators urged in a letter.",
      "Data since last fiscal year shows that the federal government has reinstated more than $150 million in stolen benefits to participants of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "But the actual amount taken from needy households is most likely much higher than that, the senators wrote in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, adding that a proposed rule that the Agriculture Department has yet to release about modernizing the cards would prevent the thefts from proliferating.",
      "\u201cThe USDA should act with urgency to require state-issued benefit cards to be protected by industry-standard payment security defenses,\u201d read the letter, which was sent Monday evening and first shared with NBC News. It was signed by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., John Fetterman, D-Pa., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Peter Welch, D-Vt., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.",
      "SNAP is a far-reaching public benefits program that helps over 42 million people nationwide purchase fruit, vegetables and other groceries, according to the Agriculture Department, which oversees SNAP. The program, which used to be referred to as food stamps, provides participants with electronic benefits transfer cards that have magnetic stripes that are swiped at card-reading machines.",
      "But unlike consumer credit and debit cards, SNAP EBT cards lack security features such as microchips or tap-to-pay technology. That makes them particularly vulnerable to \u201cskimming\u201d \u2014 a form of electronic theft that occurs when criminals hide devices in payment terminals and clone card information, including users\u2019 PINs. (See a picture of skimming overlays here.) The thieves then copy the information onto fake cards, which they use to drain SNAP participants\u2019 benefits.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that hackers and scam artists are stealing food benefits that low-income families rely on to put food on the table,\u201d Wyden said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cOur government cannot keep stalling on requiring protections against thieves who are ripping away families\u2019 benefits and leaving them without any money to pay for groceries.\u201d",
      "No state offers EBT cards with microchip protection yet, and only a small number have timetables for the transition to chip-embedded cards. California, set to start rolling them out in early 2025, is the furthest along, an Agriculture Department spokesperson said. Alabama and Oklahoma are scheduled to switch to chip cards next summer, though Alabama could implement them as soon as the spring, according to spokespeople for the agencies that administer SNAP in those states.",
      "Advocates say it\u2019s imperative that the Agriculture Department require more secure cards nationwide as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cThe households being affected are victims of crime,\u201d said Betsy Gwin, a senior economic justice attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, a nonprofit poverty law and policy center.",
      "\u201cIt continues to be extremely heartbreaking to hear from families who are doing what they can to protect themselves yet continue to be at risk and end up in a grocery store checkout line with a cart full of groceries only to discover that their benefits for that month have been stolen and they don\u2019t have the ability to provide food for their family,\u201d she said.",
      "The senators\u2019 letter called on the Agriculture Department to \u201cswiftly finalize\u201d the proposed rule for EBT card security measures that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 required it to work on.",
      "\u201cWhile the innovation of the private sector and the leadership of certain states in this space is commendable, the urgency of this issue demands a concerted federal effort,\u201d the senators wrote.",
      "Vilsack last month encouraged all governors to adopt new EBT standards for cardholders in their states. In a statement to NBC News before it received the letter, the Agriculture Department said rulemaking regarding EBT card security measures is \u201congoing and expected in calendar year 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur current regulations do not prohibit states from moving forward with implementing chip cards before this rulemaking takes place,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Reimbursements at risk",
      "The senators\u2019 letter comes at a crucial time: just days before the policy that has allowed states to use federal funds to reimburse SNAP participants for some stolen benefits is set to expire.",
      "Only a handful of states reinstate skimmed SNAP dollars using state funds, and unless Congress acts soon, federal funds will no longer be authorized to reimburse those who become victims of EBT theft after Friday \u2014 meaning most who are robbed of their grocery funds would not get them back.",
      "Those fighting food insecurity have appealed to Congress to extend federal SNAP replacement benefits in the end-of-year spending package.",
      "\u201cIt is unconscionable that some in Congress would stand in the way of providing SNAP replacement benefits to those who have been victims of fraud,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, interim president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy organization, said in a statement over the weekend.",
      "The senators\u2019 letter said stolen benefits will continue to be a problem unless the Agriculture Department removes the requirement that SNAP EBT cards have \u201coutdated and insecure\u201d magnetic stripes and instead require chip cards within the next couple of years.",
      "\u201cReplacing stolen benefits, while critical, is not a sustainable solution,\u201d the letter said. \u201cRapidly issuing the proposed rule to modernize EBT technology will reduce fraud, enhance consumer protections, and ultimately save taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "Wyden introduced a bill in March that would direct the Agriculture Department to issue updated cybersecurity regulations for SNAP EBT cards for the first time since 2010 and phase out magnetic stripe cards within five years. The bill has yet to advance.",
      "Fetterman, a co-sponsor on Wyden\u2019s bill, said in a statement to NBC News on Monday that low-income families should not have to worry about losing their benefits \u201cbecause the system hasn\u2019t kept up with basic security standards.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongress directed USDA to modernize these cards to protect families exposed to unnecessary risks of fraud and theft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on the USDA to stop dragging their feet and modernize EBT cards with the same technology we\u2019ve used for years on credit and debit cards.\u201d"

What are you talking about?\u2019 But even if people get surgery or (get on) the Ozempic craze, I\u2019m like, \u2018Who cares!\u2019 As long as people feel good about themselves, who am I to judge?\u201d she told Bustle.",

    "story": [
      "Thirty-five years ago, the world was introduced to Harry Burns and Sally Albright, two bumbling New Yorkers who fall in and out of each other's lives before finding love 12 years after meeting.",
      "\"When Harry Met Sally...\" has since given pop culture memorable lines like \"I'll have what she's having,\" fashion touchstones like Harry's sweater and trends like \"Meg Ryan fall.\"",
      "Billy Crystal reflected on the film's endurance on Sunday TODAY, saying \"there\u2019s so much truth and love in that movie.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s so much romance in that movie. There\u2019s so much confusion in that movie about relationships that that\u2019s an eternal situation for people,\" he told Willie Geist for the Dec. 15 edition of \"Sunday Sitdown.\" \"And young kids now, they\u2019re into the phase of their life where they may be falling in love and, 'Is this the right thing?' It took Harry and Sally 12 years to figure it out, you know?\"",
      "The film's tagline notably posed a philosophical, even existential, question: \"Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?\"",
      "The question is explored both in the story's plot and its dialogue. After meeting via a carpool from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry and Sally bump into each other over the years before striking up a friendship. Whether or not their relationship can stay platonic becomes the driving force of the film.",
      "Harry argues, in one of their earliest run-ins, that men and women can't just be friends \"because the sex part always gets in the way.\" And at the risk of spoiling the 35-year-old film, he's seemingly proven right by the end.",
      "After Sally hears that her ex-boyfriend is getting married, she tearfully calls Harry. When he comes over to console her, the pair sleep together for the first time and find themselves on vastly different pages the next morning: Harry wants to go back to being friends, and Sally tries to end their friendship forever.",
      "In the movie's finale, Harry sprints in the snow to profess his love to Sally at a New Year's Eve party, a scene that some on X have recently said \"literally changed the trajectory\" of their lives.",
      "The movie's screenwriter, Nora Ephron, who died in 2012, said that the film wasn't about answering the question, \"Can men and women be friends?\" Instead, the movie is about the differences in how men and women view friendship, she wrote in the introduction to a 1990 printing of the script, per Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that men don\u2019t want to be friends with women. Men know they don\u2019t understand women, and they don\u2019t much care. They want women as lovers, as wives, as mothers, but they\u2019re really not interested in them as friends. They have friends,\" she said.",
      "\"Women, on the other hand, are dying to be friends with men. Women know they don\u2019t understand men, and it bothers them: they think that if only they could be friends with them, they would understand them,\" she added.",
      "But how would that question be answered now?",
      "We asked some of the most popular authors today for their take on the core question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends? Or, updated for 2024, can two people who are attracted to each other just be friends?",
      "Here's what they said.",
      "Emily Henry",
      "Emily Henry is the author of several romance novels, including \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which she's described as an homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Book Lovers,\" featuring a main character named Nora Stephens, after Ephron.",
      "\"People We Meet on Vacation,\" currently being adapted for a film starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, follows Poppy and Alex and their friendship from college to adulthood, sustained through annual vacations.",
      "On the question of whether two people attracted to each other can just be friends, Henry says, \"I actually do think so.\"",
      "\"I think Poppy and Alex could have stayed friends, they just had to make the decision,\" she says. \"You can't be half-in and half-out, you have to make the decision and really commit to it.",
      "\"For a lot of us, attraction comes and goes, but friendship is forever,\" she adds. \"I wonder what Nora would actually say because the movie, it's like they get together, but was she really saying they can't (be friends), or was she just saying these people belong to each other? I wish I could ask her.\"",
      "Yulin Kuang",
      "Speaking of the \"People We Meet on Vacation\" film adaptation, the screenplay for that project was written by Yulin Kuang. She's also set to direct the adaptation of Henry's \"Beach Read,\" and in April she published her debut romance novel, \"How to End a Love Story.\"",
      "Kuang says she's a huge \"When Harry Met Sally...\" fan.",
      "\"I have never lived in a world without it, which feels correct,\" she says.",
      "In fact, the writer had the \"When Harry Met Sally...\" screenplay printed out and kept it on her desk, \"so I could absorb its energy by osmosis.\"",
      "Looking back on it now, she gives a clear answer on the film's question.",
      "\"Can men and women be friends? Yes,\" she says. \"Can two people who are attracted to each other \u2014 that one gives me pause.\"",
      "\"Yes, but if I was very attracted to (a friend), I would have to do some unpacking about that in therapy,\" she adds. \"If it was getting to the point of, 'We're in crush territory,' I think that would be a little dangerous.\"",
      "As to how the film answers its own question, Kuang described it as a \"specific story,\" rather than a generalization. Because both characters feel relatable, like real people pulled from the world, it's understandable to view the movie as a commentary on men and women, she says.",
      "\"But ultimately, it's really just a commentary on Harry and Sally,\" she says.",
      "Kennedy Ryan",
      "Kennedy Ryan is the author of more than 20 books, including \"Reel\" and the upcoming conclusion to her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "Ryan says \"When Harry Met Sally...\" is an example of \"nailing the happily ever after\" with the New Year's Eve love confession and kiss.",
      "\"That's like, hall of fame happily ever after,\" she says.",
      "Like Henry and Kuang, she thinks people who are attracted to each other can stay friends \u2014 but \"it can be complicated.\"",
      "\"I say that just because I have several friends who are guys who I've known for years,\" she says. \"Now, I also have had friends who were guys who, it didn't work out that way, where you thought that it would be fine being platonic, and then one catches feelings for the other, and then it gets complicated, and you can get really hurt and lose friendships that way.\"",
      "She maintains it's possible with specific boundaries.",
      "\"I think it just comes down to being clear about what you both want and when things shift, being honest about that,\" she says.",
      "It also depends on if you find them attractive, or, if you're attracted to them.",
      "\"If you are attracted to someone, and I say this as a romance novelist \u2014 like, I live by this stuff \u2014 it's the draw, it's the pull, and that's something that, if it's strong enough, it's hard to ignore,\" she says. \"But also, if you are attracted to someone, you have to ask, why is this not a romantic relationship? And when you interrogate that, maybe it helps you deal with the attraction.\"",
      "Tia Williams",
      "Tia Williams is the author of the romance novel \"Seven Days In June\" and 2024's \"A Love Song for Ricki Wilde.\"",
      "Williams calls \"When Harry Met Sally...\" a comfort movie.",
      "She says she remembers seeing \"When Harry Met Sally...\" in theaters when she was 13 and was struck by the film's central question.",
      "\"Back then, friendship was \u2014 everything was defined in very restrictive terms and put in these very traditional buckets,\" she says. \"If you're friends, that's platonic. It means you're not having sex, and you never will.",
      "\"But I think that the idea of friendship has evolved. I mean, when we get to 'Sex and the City,' we have the idea of f--- buddies, and people that you aren't pursuing a relationship with that you're really just friends with, that you're also having sex with,\" she adds.",
      "She describes the film's essential question as, \"Can you platonically be friends with someone that you are attracted to?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you can,\" she says. \"I don't think there's any way to be platonic friends with someone that you desperately want to have sex with.\"",
      "She argues if one is attracted to a friend, the dynamic can no longer be described as platonic.",
      "While having the friendship between Harry and Sally inevitably turn into a relationship may seem \"puritanical\" \u2014 \"if you're attracted, you have to be lovers\" \u2014 Williams argues the film's depiction of romance  defied gender normative roles of men and women not understanding each other.",
      "\"It's showing there's friendship within a relationship,\" she says. \"In 'When Harry Met Sally...' they were actually friends for years, and then fell in love. Women are people. Men are people. We can have friendship, respect.\"",

      "\"I would love for every rom-com to be this smart and funny and let its characters read books. Harry is often reading books in this movie and that is meaningful to me. And they just have smart conversations,\" she says.",
      "She says \"of course\" men and women can be friends, and so can two people who are attracted to each other.",
      "\"I think if the circumstances had been different their friendship would have continued for the rest of their lives, quite happily,\" she says. \"I feel like it's a very boring answer, but I think yes.\"",
      "\"I feel like I have a lot of male friends, and so I believe that of course it's possible, even with someone as absolutely charming as Billy Crystal,\" she adds. \"I think I could absolutely just be friends with Billy Crystal.\"",
      "And while the film ends with Harry and Sally in a romantic relationship, she argues the film \"does actually prove that men and women can be friends \u2014 I'm willing to say it,\" she says.",
      "\"What I believe to be true is that romance is really about timing,\" she says. \"That's what you see in the movie. There are all of these misses in terms of timing for them, and then the timing is right. But it doesn't mean in the multiverse, in the Harry and Sally multiverse, that it always would be.\"",

      "Jasmine Guillory, whose next book, \"Flirting Lessons,\" comes out in April 2025, is the author of nine romance books, including \"The Wedding Date.\"",
      "Guillory says \"absolutely\" people who are attracted to each other can be friends, because attraction isn't the only determining factor of whether or not a relationship can work.",
      "\"I'm attracted to so many people who I recognize that our relationship is perfect as it is, and I would never want to do anything to it,\" Guillory says.",
      "The film also shows that a person can be attracted to someone, but not meant for them \u2014 or at least, that version of them.",
      "\"Yes, (Harry and Sally) are meant for each other. But at the beginning of the movie, they aren't. And I think that happens in life, right?\" she says.",
      "\"There are people who you may have known 10 years ago who, if you had had a relationship then, it would be terrible, but now it's perfect,\" she says."

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 19:41:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Selena Gomez's engagement ring might be sparking a trend into marquise cut diamond rings. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",
      "Chaf\u00e9, like many internet commentators, is convinced the choice of ring stems from the song. \u201cIt must be something from there,\u201d she said.",
      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",
      "Some marquise cut-wearers are happy Gomez joined the club. A TikToker posted a video with the text, \"Now me and Selena have the same Marquise Diamond ring.\"",
      "Others are anticipating that Gomez's ring will spark a spike in popularity, making their unique rings not quite as special. One TikToker posted a video of her marquise ring with the text \"to my marquise girlies... it was nice while it lasted.\"",
      "Going forward, Chaf\u00e9 also expects the marquise cut to rise in popularity.",
      "\u201cAnything Selena Gomez does will spark a trend. Perhaps not in 2025, but in 2026, for sure, marquise will be a popular cut,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Mary is sparking debate in the religious community and casting. Here's what to know about criticism from viewers and Biblical scholars.",
    "story": [
      "A new movie about the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is sparking debate among viewers and religious scholars alike.",
      "\u201cMary,\u201d a Biblical epic streaming now on Netflix, tells the story of the Nativity through the eyes of Mary of Nazareth (Noa Cohen). The film follows Mary, Joseph (Ido Tako) and the newborn Jesus as they escape persecution from King Herod (Anthony Hopkins).",
      "\u201cMary is the most extraordinary woman ever to walk this earth, yet her story remains largely unknown beyond a few passages in the Bible,\u201d director D.J. Caruso told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "\u201cI embarked on this journey \u2014 to create a film that presents her in her most human and relatable form,\u201d he continued, adding that his aim was \u201cto portray Mary as someone we can all connect with, not just as a saint but as the young woman we all recognize before her sanctification.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe said her intention was to make Mary and Joseph\u2019s story \u201crelatable,\u201d speaking to\u00a0The Christian Post, and tell a story of a \u201cyoung girl becoming a woman in the midst of such divine expectations.\u201d",
      "While some viewers are praising the film, which has been in Netflix\u2019s Top 10 for much of the time since its debut on the streaming platform Dec. 6, others have objected to what they views as the movie\u2019s Biblical and historical inaccuracies. Others have objected to the casting.",
      "What religious scholars are saying about \u2018Mary\u2019",
      "Religious scholars have had mixed reactions to \u201cMary,\u201d as they debate perceived inaccuracies in the portrayal.",
      "Christy Cobb, a assistant professor of Christianity in the department of religious studies at the University of Denver, says the field of Biblical studies has been alight with discussions about the film. She first heard about \u201cMary\u201d through a post on Facebook \u2014 \u201ca rant post,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBiblical scholars are hearing about these movies, and then we get excited, and then when we watch it, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t depicting Biblical stories as accurately or historical moments as accurately as we hope that they would be,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d about Mary in the Bible, Cobb says. Aspects of Mary\u2019s character in the movie are based on passages of the New Testament (the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke) and an early Christian text called the Proto Gospel of James.",
      "Filmmakers took creative liberties with Mary's depiction, Cobb says. Cobb appreciated that the film's Mary is more \u201cfiery and rebellious\u201d than commonly depicted. \u201cI like that we\u2019re depicting Mary as this full character with some agency, courage and her fears at the surface,\u201d she says.",
      "But other historical inaccuracies stood out.",
      "The movie places modern conservative family values onto the Holy Family in a way that is \u201cnot supported by the text\u201d or by historical context, Cobb, who is working on a book about early Christian families, says.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Family was depicted (in the movie) as a nuclear family. Joseph is immediately supportive of Mary and will protect Mary at all costs,\u201d she says.",
      "The Bible, however, says that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary. Families also \u201clooked quite different\u201d in that era than they do today, Cobb says. Divorces were common and there would have been more people living in the household than depicted in \u201cMary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Bible, all sorts of families are represented, not just one view of a family system,\u201d she says.",
      "The result, Cobb says, is \u201cwe\u2019re having the the debate about what a Christian family (should) look like, superimposed upon this film.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe, speaking to Christian Post, said that script approval came from \u201ca range of religious leaders\u201d to \u201censure authenticity.\u201d",
      "However, only one person, Adam W. Schindler, is listed as a Biblical consultant on IMDB. Schindler is a pastor and the chief digital officer of the conservative nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute, founded by two former advisors to president Donald Trump. The movie is funded, in part, by megachurch pastor Joel Osteen, per IMDB.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Aloe Entertainment, Schindler and Caruso for comment about script consultants.",
      "Other aspects of the movie \u2014 including Mary\u2019s more down-to-earth characterization \u2014 are sparking debate for straying from doctrine.",
      "Some Catholic commentators have objected to the depiction of Mary\u2019s labor pains during the birth of Jesus, because showing Mary suffering during childbirth \u201cdoes not comport with Catholic teaching,\u201d Joseph Pronechen wrote in a review for the National Catholic Register.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Fathers and doctors of the Church, including Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, have taught that Mary alone would be exempt from such pains as a sign of her unique holiness,\u201d he sayss in his review. \u201cShe alone had no original sin.\u201d",
      "Caruso addressed his choice to show Mary in pain during labor in a recent interview with Christianity Today.",
      "\u201cRegarding the labor pains: That\u2019s about presenting Mary in a human way, acknowledging that she had apprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something like a third of women died in childbirth in antiquity.\u201d",
      "Nathanael Andrade, a chair and professor of history at Binghamton University, who has written a forthcoming book about the crucifixion of Jesus, also pointed out a \u201cserious problem\u201d for movies like \u201cMary\u201d and others that portray the life of Jesus.",
      "\u201cThe often portray everyone in ancient Jewish society that did not support Jesus as nurturing base or corrupt motivations. Such films run a serious risk of feeding pernicious anti-Semitic attitudes,\u201d he said in an email statement to TODAY.com.",
      "Why the casting of Mary also stirred up controversy",
      "\u201cMary\u201d ruffled feathers outside of the religious community. Some people have objected to the casting of Noa Cohen, a Jewish Israeli actor, as Mary. Several other actors in the movie, including Ido Tako, who plays Joseph, and Keren Tzur, who plays Elizabeth, are also Israeli.",
      "The real Mary was believed to be a Jewish woman from Nazareth, Galilee. At the time of Mary\u2019s birth, Galilee was a region in ancient Palestine. Today, it is located in northern Israel.",
      "Online, some viewers believe Mary should have been portrayed by an Arab Palestinian actor in the new movie, pointing to modern conflicts in the region. Others defended the casting of a Jewish actor to play Mary.",
      "Caruso spoke to the casting decision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201c It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum, Caruso said it was his \u201cgoal\u201d to find an actor \u201cfrom the region where Mary was born to play her.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could find a great young Jewish actress, that would be amazing,\u201d he told Netflix\u2019s Tudum.",
      "\u201cI just know that Noa did an amazing job. She\u2019s a fantastic actress. She\u2019s got this grace and beauty, and at the same time, she\u2019s accessible. I\u2019m so proud of her performance, and I think it should be celebrated. It has nothing to do with politics,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the movie is to spread love, and art is hopefully a uniter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be something that separates anybody.\u201d"

      "Despite initial reports Wednesday that the American found in Damascus might be Austin Tice, Debra Tice said, she knew instantly it wasn't her son.",
      "\"My oldest daughter came into my room at 4:25 and said: 'Mom, you know, we have this video. You need to look at it. We don't think it's Austin, but a lot of people think it's Austin, so we want you to look and see if it's Austin,'\" she recalled.",
      "She added, \"I took a glance, and I said, 'No, that is not Austin.'\"",
      "She described the number of people who reached out to the family that day with congratulatory messages, believing Timmerman was Austin Tice.",
      "\"It's almost like having a rehearsal, you know? Just an inkling of what it's going to really feel like when it is Austin walking\u00a0free,\" she told moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "Austin Tice disappeared in 2012, when he was in Syria reporting on the country's civil war.",
      "Shortly after he disappeared, the State Department State Department concluded that he was being held by the hostile Syrian government, which former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad denied for years.",
      "Since the Assad regime toppled, thousands of prisoners held captive have been freed, but it is still unclear where Tice was being held and whether he has been released.",
      "A former prisoner told NBC News that in the last few weeks he was held captive in a cell across the hall from Tice and saw him alive as recently as July 2022.",
      "NBC News can't independently verify the account, but Debra Tice said Sunday that \"we were able to verify that he was\" there in 2022.",
      "The new leadership of Syria's rebel government blamed Assad for the pain inflicted on Tice's family this month. A spokesperson for the government claimed that it was trying to locate Tice but had so far had no luck.",
      "\"We tried as much as possible to find information about Austin and return him to his mother, but we have not reached any result,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Even though her son hasn\u2019t been located yet, Debra Tice said that she remained hopeful he would be found and that her family shares \u201cjoy\u201d with the Timmerman family.",
      "\u201cThe way that I\u2019ve been feeling about the people that I see coming out and even Travis \u2014 you know that feeling where, as humans, we share joy, right? We share suffering, too, but we share joy. And so just seeing these families reunited \u2014 think about Travis\u2019 family being reunited with him \u2014 you know, what incredible joy, and we can share that,\u201d she told Welker.",
      "Last weekend, after he addressed reporters at the White House, President Joe Biden said: \"We believe he\u2019s alive. We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet. And Assad should be held accountable.",
      "\u201cWe want to get him out. We have to identify where he is,\u201d Biden said."

      "Three years on and 4,000 miles away, in her new home in northern Portugal, it remains unclear if she will ever return to that sacred place in Afghanistan or see her family in the flesh again.",
      "As a student at the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM), Farida told NBC News, she feared at the time that Taliban fighters who had regained control of the country \u201cwere going to come and knock the door\u201d and say, \u201cYou are arrested.\u201d",

      "But history, it seemed, was repeating itself.",
      "After almost two decades of fighting, trillions of dollars spent and countless lives lost, as Western nations raced to depart Afghanistan in a largely chaotic and embarrassing exit, the Taliban, whose previous government was toppled in the aftermath of 9/11 after refusing to hand over the mastermind of the attack, Osama bin Laden, began to quickly reinstitute its strict version of Sharia, or Islamic, law.",
      "Despite initially promising a more moderate rule, the group barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, and shut down hair and beauty salons across the country after deeming them un-Islamic.",
      "Girls were also banned from attending classes beyond the sixth grade, making Afghanistan the only country in the world where secondary and higher education is strictly forbidden to women and girls over age 12, according to an August report by the United Nations.",
      "The Taliban also banned virtually all forms of creative expression, including music.",
      "Even before the group could really lay down these laws, Farida and her cousin Zohra Ahmadi, both 12 at the time, believed they were in danger because of their membership with the institute."

    "story": [
      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014\u00a0The bedroom featured soft recessed lighting illuminating elegant cornicing and the dimpled headboard of the bed below. The mattress, though, was resting on the coffee table in the middle of the room.",
      "Guarded by bulletproof doors several inches thick, this was the master bedroom in one of the palaces owned by Syria's former president, Bashar al-Assad, and his wife, Asma, until they were forced to flee to Russia this week with their adult children.",
      "Assad was swept from power by a lightning-quick rebel offensive after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family\u2019s autocratic rule, and the opulent trappings of a regime that inflicted terror and poverty on Syria's people are now clear for all to see.",
      "When NBC News gained access to the squat, modernist palace perched in the mountains above the capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, it was relatively calm, despite the appearance of having been robbed. Fighters from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militant group, which led the rebel overthrow, stood guard, checking cars in a bid to put a stop to any more thefts from the building that was Assad\u2019s main residence until he was forced into exile.",
      "Inside, doors opened with a hefty sweep into a cavernous, marble-lined dining room with a table that can comfortably seat three on each end.\u00a0The chandeliers above appeared to be the finest crystal.",
      "It also appeared that no expense had been spared at one of Assad's guest palaces nearby. While one room had been torched and its chandeliers were covered in ash, some of the others looked like they might have been robbed, although art remained on the walls and the mother-of-pearl inlay was still in the doors.",
      "New carpets on renovated staircases were still under the plastic they came with, as were expensive-looking pieces of furniture, giving the impression that Assad had been planning to be in power for a long time.",
      "Back in his own palace, a room was set up as a doctor\u2019s surgery and another for a barber \u2014 complete with the chrome and leather presidential barber\u2019s chair.",
      "Elsewhere, there was an expansive library large enough to warrant a rolling ladder. Books including storybooks for toddlers and guides to Uruguay, Croatia and Sudan still lined its wood-paneled walls.\u00a0A copy of Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Country?\u201d and one of anthropologist Sue Black\u2019s \u201cAll That Remains\u201d \u2014 a memoir recounting her experiences working in war and disaster zones, had also apparently been on Assad's reading list.",
      "Now that he is gone, the reality of what happened under his rule is being exposed. As the Assads lived a life of luxury, their regime locked up, tortured and killed thousands of its citizens. Richard Engel reported from Damascus and David Hodari from London."

      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence Monday, paving the way for early elections in February and ending a turbulent year at the polls for several of Europe's leaders and governing parties.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote with the expectation of losing it, but with the hope that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of violating his trust at the time after Lindner publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon. The chancellor subsequently announced he'd call for a no-confidence vote.",
      "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier now has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election, and he is expected to do so after Christmas. New elections will then have to be held within 60 days of his decision.",
      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",
      "If Steinmeier allows the dissolution of parliament, something he is likely to rubber-stamp given his largely ceremonial role, a vote will take place just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled.",
      "Scholz called the confidence vote after weeks of infighting with his coalition partners on a 2025 budget and Germany's future economic policy prior to Lindner's firing.",
      "Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, a leading British investment bank, told CNBC that Germany's leaders are likely going to find agreement on fiscal policy regardless of the new election results.",
      "\"Even if within say the first three to six months of the new administration you don\u2019t get changes to the debt brake, if they have a big enough majority, eventually I think economic conditions will just force them to accept the reality that they need a fiscal stimulus,\" Pickering said.",
      "While the Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0led by Friedrich Merz, is ahead in the polls, according to Reuters, the far-right Alternative for\u00a0Germany\u00a0(AfD) could also help to shape the new government.",
      "Fresh from September's success in regional elections in Thuringia, when it became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, the party is also polling well at a national level.",
      "However, it is unlikely the group would be able to govern because other parties have refused to align themselves with the far right, despite Germany\u2019s parliamentary system traditionally producing coalitions.",
      "Germany's snap elections come after the Labour Party won power in the U.K. for the first time in over a decade and French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in his country, which led to political turmoil.",
      "Facing pressure from both the right and the left, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned earlier this month after he lost a confidence vote that\u00a0collapsed his government. It was the first time in more than six decades that a parliamentary coalition fell apart in France.",
      "Macron appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, a centrist, to replace Barnier last week in the hopes that he could bridge the deeply divided government."

      "Seven foreign tourists\u00a0were hospitalized in Fiji in a suspected case of alcohol poisoning at a luxury resort, Fijian and Australian officials said Monday.",
      "The guests, who, according to local media, included an American, were hospitalized after they drank cocktails\u00a0at a bar at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka. The group also included four Australians and two unidentified foreign nationals.",
      "They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, The Associated Press reported, citing Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson Jemesa Tudravu.",
      "Two people remained stable in the hospital Monday, Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka was quoted as saying by the AP, while five others have been discharged.",
      "The cause of the guests\u2019 illness was not immediately clear, and officials said that until test results were available it was too soon to say whether contaminated alcohol played a role.",
      "The case is similar to one in the Southeast Asian country of Laos last month in which six tourists, including an American and two Australian teenagers, died after they drank alcohol tainted with methanol.",
      "Gavoka said there were no other reports of similar illness at the resort or elsewhere in Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago nation that is home to about 930,000 people. He said the Warwick resort, which is on the Coral Coast of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, \u201cholds a strong reputation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said, according to the AP.",
      "The Warwick resort said that it takes the safety of its guests \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that it was working with authorities to determine what happened.",
      "\u201cAs a business that has proudly traded in Fiji for almost 40 years, this is an unprecedented event for us,\u201d the resort management said in a statement.",
      "They said the resort maintains the highest standards of food and beverage safety.",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to the health and safety of our guests, and we are with our guests every step of the way as we investigate this unfortunate incident,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Canberra on Monday that four Australians had been hospitalized over the weekend and that Fiji police were investigating to determine the cause of their illnesses.",
      "\u201cWe are thinking of the friends and family of the people who are affected. This is no doubt a very distressing time for them,\u201d he said.",
      "David Sandoe, of Australia, whose daughter and granddaughter were among those affected, told Sky News Australia on Monday that they were headed back to Australia after having been cleared for release and that the hotel and Fiji police had been \u201cfantastic\u201d in keeping everyone informed.",
      "Australia has also updated its travel advisory for Fiji to warn about the risk of alcoholic drinks\u2019 being spiked or poisoned with methanol.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t leave your drinks unattended, pay attention when your drinks are being mixed and get urgent medical help if you suspect that something is wrong,\u201d Chalmers said."

    "story": [
      "A woman was arrested in Iran after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube, even though the Iranian parliament passed a new, stricter law on women's modesty that rights groups have criticized.",
      "Parastoo Ahmadi posted a 27-minute video of her concert performance Wednesday, in which she sang in a sleeveless dress with her hair down accompanied by four male musicians. In the caption, she described it as an \"imaginary concert\" and invited the audience to \"imagine this beautiful homeland\" in Iran.",
      "The performance was recorded in a caravanserai, the name for the roadside inns historically built along the Silk Road to provide merchants and travelers with places to rest as they trekked the ancient trade route spanning North Africa to Central Asia. Ahmadi wrote that it was \"where history and our myths intertwine.\"",
      "\"I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love,\" the caption said. \"This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.\"",
      "Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, told The Associated Press that Ahmadi was arrested Saturday over the performance. He said he was unaware of the charges, the arresting agency or the location of her detention.",
      "Iran's judiciary confirmed that a case has been opened into Ahmadi's performance but did not specify the charges. The statement, released by the state-run Mehr News Agency, also said Ahmadi was released after an interview with authorities.",
      "\"The Mazandaran Police Information Center announced that Ms. Parastoo Ahmadi attended a briefing session after posting a video deemed contrary to cultural norms and values,\" the agency said. \"She has been asked to appear before judicial authorities.\"",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norway-based organization, said it got a report that two of the men performing with her \u2014 Sohail Faghih-Nassiri and Ehsan Beyraghdar \u2014 were also arrested.",
      "Iran's hijab laws tighten",
      "The hard-line regimes that have reigned since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution have passed laws saying women must be veiled in the presence of men, though women have resisted the rules both domestically and abroad.",
      "Conflict over the issue drew international outrage once again in 2022 when a young woman named Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested outside a subway station in Tehran and accused of failing to properly wear a hijab. She was dead just three days later.",
      "Iran's government denied wrongdoing, claiming that Amini died of pre-existing medical conditions. Human rights groups, however, have cast doubt on that, and a United Nations fact-finding mission\u00a0asserted she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities.",
      "Her death drew rage throughout Iran, drawing women out to protest in droves despite violent crackdowns by authorities.",
      "The authorities who enforce the modesty laws, often called the morality police, have eased public confrontations with women over veiling since President Masoud Pezeshkian was elected this year. Pezeshkian campaigned as a reformist who opposed such types of morality police patrols.",
      "But enforcement has not stopped altogether, according to locals who have said the police are now instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate action. So-called anti-unveiling clinics have also been established, where women are encouraged to follow the hijab laws through \"therapy.\"",
      "Despite Pezeshkian's reformist approach, the parliament pushed even harsher laws about women's veiling this year.",
      "The Hijab and Chastity Law was originally submitted by former President Ebrahim\u00a0Raisi, who died in May, and it was ultimately passed in September, according to Human Rights Watch. Enforcement will go into effect for a three-year trial period, which the rights organization said will dramatically increase the punishments for women who do not comply.",
      "The new law extends the enforcement into online spaces, increases fines for violations depending on frequency, institutes a travel ban for offenders and includes long-term imprisonment as punishment, Human Rights Watch reported. Fines alone could be detrimental for many Iranians as the country's economy has struggled under the weight of years of sanctions and regional conflict.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Council's experts on Friday called for the law to be repealed, describing it as a \"comprehensive system of gender-based persecution.\"",
      "Pezeshkian himself criticized the law this month as difficult to enforce in both a statement on X and an interview on state television.",
      "\u201cWe should not do anything that disrupts the unity and solidarity of society,\u201d Pezeshkian said. \u201cWe need to have dialogue and engage in discussions about this issue.\u201d"

    "summary": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. has made direct contact with Syria\u2019s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) rebels as they transition from a militant insurgency toward a more legitimate governing authority.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. has made direct contact with Syria\u2019s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) rebels as they transition from a militant insurgency toward a more legitimate governing authority.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\u201d Blinken said after talks in Aqaba, Jordan, with diplomats and representatives from several Arab nations.",
      "The U.S. designates HTS a terrorist organization, making it legally impossible to work with the group, but contact underscores ongoing efforts to change that designation as the U.S. and its allies look to support Syria's transition from Bashar al-Assad's rule.",
      "In a joint statement after the meeting, the governments of the U.S. and Turkey, the E.U., and Arab countries called for \u201ca more hopeful, secure and peaceful future\u201d in Syria, stressing respect for women and minorities and preventing \u201cthe reemergence of all terrorist groups.\u201d",
      "The statement stressed that \"the transitional political process must be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned [and] produce an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government.\"",
      "No representatives from Syria were at the meeting.",
      "The talks reflect cautious optimism over HTS\u2019 evolving role in governing Syria, with early signs of efforts to establish stability after 13 years of civil war, and within the nation's many factions.",
      "Front of mind for Washington is the return of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in Syria over a decade ago. Blinken said in Jordan that he had emphasized the importance of finding Tice in talks with Syria's new parties.",
      "Tice is thought to have been taken captive near Damascus in August 2012 while he was covering the country\u2019s civil war. But while thousands of prisoners were released when HTS took control of Damascus, Tice\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown.",
      "Obaida Al-Arnaot, an official spokesperson, said Syria\u2019s interim government had tried to find Tice, who is 43, to reunite him with his family but had so far had no luck. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that efforts to pinpoint his location in Syria were ongoing.",
      "In another sign of the shifting dynamics, Turkey announced Sunday that it has reopened its embassy in Damascus after 12 years, while schools and universities have also resumed operations in areas formerly controlled by Assad.",
      "Turkish Defense Minister Ya\u015far G\u00fcler\u00a0has said his country is ready to offer military training to Syria \"if the new administration requests it.\u201d",
      "In comments authorized for publication Sunday and translated by Reuters, G\u00fcler said Turkey saw no signs of a complete Russian withdrawal after satellite images appeared to show Russian forces packing up and dismantling military equipment at one of their key bases in Syria.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians are going to leave,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll do everything they can to stay.\u201d",
      "As the transition continues, there is concern for Syria\u2019s minority groups. Kurdish communities, in particular, have expressed wariness about HTS, given the group\u2019s past association with Al Qaeda and the uncertain future of ethnic and religious minorities under its control.",
      "In a message to the Kurds, HTS leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa, formerly known by the nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, sought to ease fears with a statement Saturday, stating that Kurds are \u201cpart of the homeland\u201d and that \u201cthere will be no injustice\u201d against them.",
      "\u201cThe coming Syria will have the Kurds as its foundations, and we will live together in it, and everyone will take their rights,\u201d he said.",
      "The message is part of HTS\u2019 ongoing efforts to project a more moderate image and distance itself from its Al Qaeda past, even as the U.S. continues to view the group as a terrorist organization. In 2018, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Al-Sharaa's head.",
      "Israel remains deeply concerned about extremists' gaining power in neighboring Syria, and it carried out multiple airstrikes on Syrian weapons depots and air defenses overnight into Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",
      "The attack appears to be the latest in a series of airstrikes that Israel says are aimed at preventing Assad\u2019s arsenal from falling into the hands of militants.",
      "But U.S. engagement with HTS may signal a potential shift in Washington's approach, sparking hopes that it may eventually remove the strict sanctions, which it has imposed on the country for decades and intensified at the start of the civil war in 2011.",
      "\u201cWe can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see, really, a rallying around building of Syria,\u201d United Nations envoy Geir Pedersen told reporters during a visit to Damascus to meet the new interim government.",
      "Biden has already outlined continued U.S. involvement in Syria, without commenting on whether Washington would remove or reconsider the designation.",
      "\u201cWe will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime, toward independent, sovereign and independent,\u201d he said last week. \u201cSyria with a new constitution, new government that serves all Syrians.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe have to shoot more,\u201d said Guardiola, whose team has been held scoreless in recent losses against Liverpool, Tottenham and Juventus. \u201cWe have to defend better,\u201d said the Catalan coach, recognizing his team\u2019s deficiencies. \u201cWe have to avoid mistakes,\u201d he added, with his team sitting fourth in the Premier League table before this weekend's matches.",
      "Meanwhile, misery is more commonplace in the other half of Manchester. Manchester United hasn\u2019t won a Premier League title since the retirement of legendary manager Alex Ferguson in 2013.",

      "\u201cWe are playing this season without the best player,\u201d Guardiola said Friday of Rodri\u2019s absence.

He\u2019s been ruled out for the remainder of the season.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s issues are wider-ranging, as evidenced by its position in the bottom half of the table. In its two most recent games, its goalkeeper, Andr\u00e9 Onana, has made calamitous clangers, leading to easy goals for the opposition.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to build up a lot with the goalkeeper,\u201d Amorim said of Onana\u2019s most recent mistake, which saw him pass the ball to the opposition in Manchester United\u2019s Europa League victory against Czech team Viktoria Plze\u0148. \u201cWe managed to help Onana like he did in the past,\u201d Amorim added, dismissing the error\u2019s significance in the context of a match United eventually won.",
      "Despite the concerning play of both teams in recent months, they share a glimmer of hope: their strikers. Manchester City\u2019s star forward Erling Haaland still sits jointly atop the Premier League scorers list. The Norwegian has notched 13 goals 15 matches into the season.",
