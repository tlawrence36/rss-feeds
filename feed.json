      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens.\u201d",
      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was raised to go to work \u2014 to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2001.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",

      "The publicist for Scottish painter Jack Vettriano says he has been found dead in his apartment in France",
      "LONDON -- Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, known for his works depicting elegant men and women on dreamlike beaches, has been found dead in his apartment in France, his publicist said Monday. He was 73.",
      "British media reported there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death on Saturday.",
      "Vettriano, born Jack Hoggan in Fife, Scotland on Nov. 17, 1951, was a self-taught artist who created some of the world's most recognizable contemporary paintings.",
      "His 1992 painting \u201cThe Singing Butler\u201d \u2014 featuring a couple in evening dress dancing on a storm-swept beach as their butler and maid proffered umbrellas \u2014 became a best-selling image in Britain.",
      "In 2005, elusive street artist Banksy based a satirical painting titled \u201cCrude Oil (Vettriano)\u201d on \u201cThe Singing Butler,\u201d adding a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste to the composition to send an environmental message.",
      "Vettriano left school at 15 to become a mining engineer but took up painting after a girlfriend gave him a box of watercolors for his 21st birthday. His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy\u2019s annual show. Both sold on the first day.",
      "Although some art critics dismissed his work, he enjoyed commercial success and held exhibitions in London, Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere. Actor Jack Nicholson and lyricist Tim Rice were among those who acquired Vettriano's work.",
      "\u201cJack Vettriano\u2019s passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art,\u201d his publicist said in a statement. \"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\u201d"

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- At the Oscars ceremony, they were there. At the after-parties, they were barely there.",
      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

      "Actor Lily James, ballet dancer Maria Bogdanovich and model Ana Beatriz Barros were among the guests who sat cozily on curving sofas for the back-to-back shows. Armani also invited Italian senator-for-life Liliana Segre, a Holocaust survivor, and figures from Milan's cultural institutions.",

    "story": [
      "When Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Last fall, Sean Baker was sitting in a Manhattan restaurant, talking about a poll. The survey, about sex in movies and television, showed that Gen Z moviegoers were mostly turned off by sex in film.",
      "\u201cThat broke my heart. I thought, there\u2019s something wrong here,\u201d said Baker. \u201cYou\u2019re OK with all the violence that\u2019s out there? Sex is a vital part of existence. Why don\u2019t you want to see sex in our stories?\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember being on set and being like: We\u2019re pushing against that poll.\u201d",
      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",

      "Its closest competition is \u201cConclave,\u201d the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes. It won at the BAFTAs and the SAG Awards, wins that came just as Pope Francis was hospitalized for double pneumonia. Oscar voting concluded before the pope fell ill.",
      "Also in the mix are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d nominated for 10 awards, and the musical hit \u201cWicked,\u201d also with 10 nominations. Several of the early craft Oscars could be shared between \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "For the first time, an actor is nominated for playing the sitting U.S. president. Sebastian Stan is nominated for best actor for his performance as a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as is his co-star, Jeremy Strong, for playing Roy Cohn. Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",
      "The political tenor of this year\u2019s ceremony could be volatile, with the Oscars coming weeks into the second Trump administration and falling two days after the president\u2019s dramatic rupture with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, O\u2019Brien said he'll strive to strike a delicate balance.",
      "\u201cI cannot ignore the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also have to remember it\u2019s threading a needle. I also have to remember what we\u2019re here to celebrate and infuse the show with positivity.\u201d",
      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year. But there will be music, including a performance by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, with Queen Latifah.",
      "Last year\u2019s acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph \u2014 will also take part in the ceremony. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\u201d style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans.",
      "The ceremony will be taking place days following the death of Gene Hackman. The 95-year-old two-time Oscar winner and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their New Mexico home.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",
      "Dawson Democrat Sen. Freddie Powell Sims voted for both bills. Four Democrats for the bill banning gender-affirming care for people in prison.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",

      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- A security guard at an Arizona hospital was shot and wounded over the weekend, and the man suspected in the attack was quickly disarmed and taken into custody, authorities say.",
      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",
      "Police on Monday identified the suspect as Maximillian Yanofsky. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on multiple charges including aggravated assault, police said.",
      "Efforts to contact a lawyer for Yanofsky on Monday weren't immediately successful.",
      "The security guard was taken to a trauma center for a higher level of care and remained hospitalized Monday, police said. A different security guard was injured in the hand and wrist during the incident, police said.",
      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",
      "Late last month, a man carrying a pistol and zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Last year, a man shot two corrections officers in the ambulance bay of an Idaho hospital while freeing a white supremacist gang member before he could be returned to prison. They were caught less than two days later.",
      "Healthcare and social assistance employees suffered almost three-quarters of nonfatal attacks on workers in the private sector in 2021 and 2022 for a rate more than five times the national average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."

      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",

      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",

      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",

      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",

      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",

      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",

      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",

      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

      "You\u2019ll hear this declared all over the land, from the prime minister and university students in Nuuk, the world\u2019s northernmost capital, to hunters and fishermen in sparsely populated villages across the planet's largest island. This is, after all, Kalaallit Nunaat \u2014 Greenlandic for the \u201cLand of the People\u201d or the \u201cLand of the Greenlanders.\u201d",
      "Most of those 57,000 Greenlanders are Indigenous Inuit. They take pride in a culture and traditions that have helped them survive for centuries in exceptionally rugged conditions. In their close link to nature. In belonging to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth.",
      "Many in this semi-autonomous territory are worried and offended by Trump\u2019s threats to seize control of their mineral-rich homeland, even by force, because he says the U.S. needs it \u201cfor national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can a few words \u2026 change the whole world?\u201d asked Aqqaluk Lynge, a former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and founder of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which governs Greenland. \u201cIt can because he\u2019s playing with fire. We\u2019re seeing another United States here with whole new ideas and wishes.\u201d",
      "Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realize it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of oil; its potential for shipping and trade routes as that ice keeps retreating because of climate change.",
      "Not even one of Trump\u2019s most fervent fans in Greenland \u2014 who proudly wears a MAGA hat, and a T-shirt emblazoned with Trump pumping his fist and the words: \u201cAmerican Badass\u201d \u2014 wants to be American.",
      "But like other Greenlanders, he wants stronger ties to the U.S. and to open for business beyond Denmark, which colonized them 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defense policy.",
      "\u201cWhen Trump came to office, he wanted to talk to Greenlanders directly without going through Denmark. He wants to negotiate with us and that\u2019s why the Danish are very afraid,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen Boassen, who has visited the White House and welcomed Donald Trump Jr. when he recently visited Nuuk.",
      "The American president's comments set off a political crisis in Denmark. The prime minister went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced \u201ca more uncertain reality,\u201d while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.",
      "For some, it\u2019s been dizzying, a rollercoaster of emotions since Trump\u2019s threats, since his son landed in Nuuk in January in a TRUMP-emblazoned plane and since his father posted on social media: \u201cMAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\u201d with a message to Greenlanders: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen that was happening, I felt like I was hit in the stomach,\u201d said Qupanuk Olsen, a mining engineer and social media influencer running in the election for the Naleraq party.",
      "Around her, supporters gathered at a bay filled with giant pieces of ice in Nuuk waving the red and white national flag that represents the sun and the ice that covers most of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI could feel that the ground will no longer ever be the same again,\" she said. \"It\u2019s as if we were on sea ice and it started to break, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d",
      "Journalists from afar have descended on Nuuk, asking locals what they think of Trump\u2019s words. Pro-Trump media influencers known as the Nelk Boys arrived handing out MAGA hats and $100 bills to children in Nuuk\u2019s streets.",
      "\u201cEven though there are strong feelings of sadness, despair, confusion, I think we\u2019re also stronger than ever. We\u2019re fighting it for our people and that gives me hope,\u201d said Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer. She is suspicious of Trump\u2019s intentions but still thanks him for turning the world\u2019s attention to her homeland.",
      "\u201cWe went through all the emotions \u2014 at first very funny, very light, then very serious,\u201d said Hansen, who worked with Conan O\u2019Brien when the comedian came to Nuuk in 2019 to shoot an episode poking fun at Trump\u2019s idea of buying Greenland. \u201cNow, with all the international press that\u2019s been here, we\u2019ve been given a voice that\u2019s being taken seriously.\u201d",
      "Like many other Greenlanders, she doesn\u2019t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump\u2019s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.",
      "The former colonial ruler is accused of committing abuses against her island\u2019s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment for Greenland ... compared to two months ago when nobody was talking about independence,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cNow, everybody\u2019s talking about it.\"",
      "A former colony of Denmark, Greenland gained self-rule in 1979 and now runs itself through its parliament. A treaty with the United States, and a U.S. military base in Greenland, also gives Washington say over the territory\u2019s defense.",
      "Greenland is massive \u2014 about one-fifth the size of the United States or three times the size of Texas. Its land mass is in North America, and its Arctic capital city is closer to New York than to Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cDenmark is just a middle man in that whole setup. And we don\u2019t need that middle man anymore,\u201d said Juno Berthelsen, a candidate in the election for Naleraq party. He says Trump has given Greenland leverage to negotiate with Denmark. \u201cOur political goal is to have our own defense agreement, so that we connect directly with the U.S. in terms of defense and security.\u201d",
      "His party, he said, aims to invoke an article in a law that would give Greenland increased autonomy and eventually a path to full independence.",
      "Asked to describe Greenland\u2019s moment, he said: \u201cIf I had to pick one word, it would be exciting. And full of opportunities.\u201d",
      "In his first term in office, Trump began to talk about acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Back in 2019, most dismissed it. But it had a ripple effect.",
      "\u201cIt was not taken that seriously back then as it is today. But it was important for Greenland because he, without wanting, did Greenlanders a favor,\u201d said Ebbe Volquardsen, a professor of cultural history at the University of Greenland. \u201cHe underlined the value of being in a union with Greenland.\u201d",
      "Greenland\u2019s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about $600 million from Denmark. When Trump showed interest in buying Greenland because of its strategic location and mineral resources, he highlighted that annual sum as the amount of what other nations would be willing to pay to have a military or commercial presence in Greenland, Volquardsen said. With that, he gave Greenland leverage for more autonomy and possible reparations for abuses committed by its former colonial ruler.",
      "\u201cThat was important because the narrative in Denmark until that date \u2026 had been that Greenland is receiving this funding as a kind of aid or altruistic gift,\u201d Volquardsen, said.",
      "Life in Nuuk seemed to go on as usual in mid-February, except for a \u201cheat wave.\u201d After weeks of subzero temperatures, it made the capital of Greenland several degrees hotter than Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.",
      "Large chunks of powder blue ice were blown by winds, blocking boats on the harbor and creating a spectacle for residents who snapped photos under the pink light of a sunset. Some nights, the sky was lit up by spectacular streaks of green and other colors from the northern lights.",
      "You could almost forget that Greenland has become ground zero for a geopolitical showdown \u2014 if, that is, you ignored the front pages of local newspapers featuring images of Trump and the ticker tape in downtown with his name and the Greenlandic word \u201cAmerikamiut.\u201d",
      "On a frigid day, a group of kindergarteners in fluorescent vests walked in line behind their teacher as they crossed a road covered in ice and snow. A few blocks away, teenagers played hockey on a frozen pond.",
      "On a hill next to a statue of the Danish-Norwegian missionary who founded the city in 1721, bells tolled, and a recently married couple laughed as family members threw rice on them for good fortune outside Nuuk\u2019s wooden Lutheran cathedral. More than 90% of Greenlanders identify as Lutherans.",
      "After the wedding ceremony, guests converged at their home for a \u201cKaffemik,\u201d a traditional celebratory gathering where they share coffee and baked goods.",
      "Some Greenlanders say they felt safe while being largely unknown to the world. Now, though, that feeling has dissipated.",
      "Sitting with her husband at a dinner table filled with families chatting and laughing, Tukumminnguaq Olsen Lyberth, said the wave of attention and polarizing comments prompted some friends to delete Facebook accounts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not use to having this big attention about us, so it\u2019s overwhelming. Before, no one knew about us. Now, it\u2019s a blitz of attention,\u201d said Olsen Lyberth, 37, a cultural history student at the University of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is the longest January,\u201d she said jokingly \u2014 in February. \u201cIt\u2019s all of it. Everything feels too overwhelming.\"",

      "Aid groups are now trying to assess what stocks they do have in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?\" said Jonathan Crikx, a spokesperson for UNICEF. \"We never sat on supplies, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a huge amount left to distribute.\u201d",

      "During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies and quickly ramped up their capabilities. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in, they were able to double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency, or OCHA.",
      "The United Nations and associated nongovernmental organizations brought in around 100,000 tents as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes, only to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in.",

      "\u201cThe traders are massacring us, the traders are not merciful to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning, the price of sugar was 5 shekels, ask him now, the price has become 10 shekels.\u201d",
      "In the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, one cigarette priced at 5 shekels ($1.37) before the cutoff now stands at 20 shekels ($5.49). One kilo of chicken (2.2 pounds) that was 21 shekels ($5.76) is now 50 shekels. ($13.72).

      "The budget, which adds up to about $245 billion, was announced at the National People\u2019s Congress, the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature. The Pentagon and many experts say China's total spending on defense may be 40% higher or more because of items included under other budgets.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The speaker of New Zealand \u2019s Parliament told lawmakers he would not consider further complaints about the use of the country\u2019s M\u0101ori name, Aotearoa, in Parliament, after one lawmaker made a bid to have it banned.",
      "\u201cAotearoa is regularly used as a name of New Zealand,\u201d Speaker Gerry Brownlee said in a ruling on Tuesday at Parliament in Wellington. \u201cIt appears on our passports and it appears on our currency.\u201d",
      "The conflict over a word increasingly prominent in New Zealand life arose last month when one lawmaker objected to another\u2019s use of the term. It reflects the way enthusiasm for the Indigenous language among New Zealanders of all ethnicities has at times prompted a backlash \u2014 including about what the country should be called. It was also the latest salvo in the so-called \u201cculture war\u201d-style friction between two political parties.",
      "Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez March, from the left-leaning Green Party, used the name Aotearoa during a question to a government minister. The composite word means \u201cland of the long white cloud\" in te reo M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori language.",

Men\u00e9ndez March, who was born in Mexico, is a New Zealand citizen, which is a requirement for all lawmakers.",
      "Peters asked Brownlee to bar use of the term Aotearoa in Parliament. On Tuesday, Brownlee said lawmakers were already permitted to address Parliament in any of New Zealand\u2019s three official languages \u2014 English, te reo M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language.",
      "\u201cThat really is the end of the matter,\u201d he said. Brownlee had earlier asked Men\u00e9ndez March to consider using the phrase \u201cAotearoa New Zealand\u201d to refer to the country, \u201cto assist anyone who might not understand the term,\u201d but said he would not require it.",
      "\u201cIf other members do not like certain words, they don\u2019t have to use them,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a matter of order and I don\u2019t expect to have further points of order raised about it.\u201d",
      "Peters told reporters that Brownlee was \u201cwrong\u201d and that he would not answer questions in which New Zealand was referred to as Aotearoa. Men\u00e9ndez March did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other lawmakers refer to New Zealand by its M\u0101ori name. But it's not the first time Peters and his party have fixed on Men\u00e9ndez March.",
      "In January, the Green Party complained to the Prime Minister and Brownlee after Peters\u2019 deputy, Shane Jones, heckled during a Parliamentary debate with a remark about Mexicans \u2014 while Peters told two other Green lawmakers who immigrated to New Zealand that they should \u201cshow some gratitude\u201d to the country.",

      "A flamboyant politician who is New Zealand\u2019s longest-serving current lawmaker, Peters favors populist policies and has been decried before for remarks about Asian immigration to New Zealand.

      "Pope Francis has stabilized enough after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and resume receiving just high flows of supplemental oxygen via a nasal tube to help him breathe, the Vatican says",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis had stabilized enough Tuesday after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and receive just high flows of supplemental oxygen, as he continued his more than two-week long fight against double pneumonia, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis, 88, woke up and was resuming respiratory physiotherapy after sleeping through the night, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican said as of Tuesday morning, Francis no longer needed to wear the mechanical ventilation mask that covers his nose and mouth to pump oxygen into his lungs and was just receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "He had to resume using the mask on Monday after suffering two respiratory crises that required doctors to extract \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of mucus from his lungs. Doctors performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn\u2019t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense.",
      "The fact that Francis no longer needed the ventilation mask by Tuesday morning was a sign that he had stabilized some after the crises, but still within what doctors have said was a complex respiratory picture.",
      "The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection.",
      "The Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body\u2019s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don\u2019t indicate any new bacteria.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted, was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn\u2019t need it anymore.",
      "The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. \u201cThe fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s taking little steps forward and then steps back,\u201d said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",
      "Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It\u2019s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness.",
      "Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive \u201cordinary\u201d care such as hydration and nutrition, but \u201cextraordinary\u201d or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life.",
      "Francis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican\u2019s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was \u201cno obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.\u201d He added: \u201cIt thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of \u2018overzealous treatment.\u2019\u201d",
      "Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church\u2019s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that.",
      "\u201cToday the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,\u201d he told reporters Monday. \u201cToday the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II\u2019s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.",

      "St. Francis is the medieval Catholic saint whose spirituality focused on loving the poor, creation, and peace",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- As Pope Francis entered his third week in a hospital battling pneumonia, hundreds of pilgrims continued to make their way to this hilltop town to pray at the tomb of St. Francis, the hometown medieval saint whom the pontiff chose as his papal name.",
      "Groups from the United States, Ukraine and all over Italy made their way through a town of grey and brown stone houses that look little changed from when the saint was born here more than 840 years ago.",
      "They said they were inspired by St. Francis\u2019 love for the poor, peace and creation \u2014 all priorities for the pope, too, and the Franciscans, one of the largest orders in the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cThe life of St. Francis teaches the way to holiness is giving up yourself, getting rid of things that hold us back in our life here, and just offer ourselves to the Lord,\u201d said the Rev. Paul Vu, who was visiting in early March with a group of 50 Vietnamese-American parishioners from Santa Ana, California.",
      "In 1182, Francis was born to a wealthy family in Assisi, which rises above a fertile valley in central Italy. Praying in front of a crucifix, he heard a call to reform the church. He aspired to strip everything down to the essentials in the service of God.",
      "The Santuario della Spogliazione, which literally means stripping, is a sober stone church on the hillside. It marks the spot where he gave up even his clothes in front of his father, who disinherited him. St. Francis was accepted into the church by the bishop as an advocate of the poor and went on to found a religious order that\u2019s still active globally today, the Franciscans.",
      "For Assisi\u2019s current bishop, the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino, St. Francis\u2019 renunciation of material encumbrances also signaled his love of creation and of peace.",
      "\u201cFrancis, stripping himself, came back to nature in some sense. So we must receive nature as a gift of God, and respect this gift,\u201d Sorrentino told The Associated Press.",
      "During the Crusades, St. Francis befriended a Muslim sultan \u2014 their exchanges are still seen as an example of the kind of interfaith dialogue that St. John Paul II promoted by gathering leaders of the major global religions in Assisi during his papacy.",
      "\u201cAssisi is the place to pray for peace in the world and inside of ourselves,\u201d said Elizabeth Nu\u00f1ez, a Passionist sister from Colombia who was there in pilgrimage on a recent weekend.",
      "After being elected, a pope chooses a name to adopt for his papacy. Jorge Mario Bergoglio picked Francis in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe explained it in a very simple way, that he chose Francis\u2019 name because he\u2019s the man of peace, of the poor, of brotherhood. The man who loves and respects creation,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent 30 years in Assisi and now leads the Vatican\u2019s committee on World Children\u2019s Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a name that contains a life program.\u201d",
      "Several of the pope\u2019s encyclicals \u2014 teaching documents for the church \u2014 pulled from Franciscan themes and quotes, including one about building a more inclusive church.",
      "This year will mark the 800th anniversary of St. Francis\u2019 celebrated \u201ccanticle of creatures,\u201d where he praises God for the sun, the moon and other natural elements he refers to as brothers and sisters.",
      "Pope Francis used its title for an encyclical highlighting the importance of taking care of the environment because it\u2019s a gift from God that humankind only gets to protect, not exploit.",
      "Dora Pell, a 75-year-old pilgrim from England, went walking in the woods around Assisi beloved by St. Francis and called it as moving as sitting by his tomb in the Basilica of St. Francis on the edge of town.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a spirituality that\u2019s based on love and inclusiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing Christ everywhere, in everything and everybody.\u201d",
      "The basilica contains a cycle of more than two dozen frescoes illustrating crucial moments in St. Francis\u2019 life \u2014 including the \u201cspogliazione.\u201d",
      "Painted by Giotto at the end of the 13th century, they marked a turning point in Western art. Their realism and careful rendering of space and depth went far beyond what was common in the Middle Ages and presaged the Renaissance.",
      "They were spared destruction in the 1997 earthquake that hit the region, killing four people in the basilica itself.",
      "Across town is the Basilica di Santa Chiara, dedicated to St. Clare, who embraced radical poverty to imitate St. Francis. He made available to her and the growing group of women following her a local church \u2014 the beginning of the Poor Clares order, now present in 70 countries with 20,000 sisters.",

      "That makes Assisi \u201ca condensation of holiness in a small town,\u201d Fortunato said. And it all links back to St. Francis\u2019 choice 800 years ago.",
      "\u201cIn the end, Francis is pure Gospel. He\u2019s the good news,\u201d Fortunato said.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine fighter jet with two pilots on board has lost contact during a night combat assault in support of ground forces battling communist insurgents in a southern province, and an extensive search is underway, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The FA-50 jet lost communication during the mission with other air force aircraft around midnight Monday before reaching a target area. The other aircraft were able to return safely to an air base in central Cebu province after carrying out assaults, the air force said without providing other details for security reasons.",
      "A Philippine military official told The Associated Press that the incident happened in a southern province, where a counterinsurgency mission against New People's Army guerrillas was underway. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive situation publicly.",
      "\"We are hopeful of locating them and the aircraft soon and ask you to join us in prayer during this critical time,\u201d air force spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo said.",
      "The pilots could eject from the supersonic jets in case they encounter any problem that could lead to a crash. Rescuers could locate them if their emergency locating transmitters emitted signals.",
      "Castillo refused to say if rescuers have detected such signals but added that the military is \u201cstill very optimistic that they are safe.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear if the rest of the FA-50s would be grounded following the incident.",
      "The Philippines acquired 12 FA-50s multi-purpose fighter jets starting in 2015 from South Korea\u2019s Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. The 18.9 billion peso ($331 million) contract had been the biggest under a military modernization program that has been repeatedly stalled by a lack of funds. The Philippines plans to acquire another 12 fighter jets from South Korea.",
      "The military estimates about 1,000 communist guerrillas remain after decades of battle setbacks, surrenders and factional fighting. Peace talks brokered by Norway collapsed under previous President Rodrigo Duterte after both sides accused the other of continuing deadly attacks despite the negotiations.",
      "In 2023, the government and the communist rebels agreed to resume talks aimed at ending one of Asia\u2019s longest insurgencies. But the talks still have not restarted under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
      "Aside from anti-insurgency operations, the jets have been used in a range of activities, from major national ceremonies to patrolling the disputed South China Sea."

      "On the frontline, where Ukraine is struggling to fend off the much larger and better-equipped Russian army, another soldier said the U.S. decision would enable Russia to make further battlefield gains.",
      "\u201cWar is very pragmatic,\u201d he told the AP on condition of anonymity in compliance with military regulations. \u201cIf we have weapons, enough ammunition, infantry, armored vehicles and aviation \u2014 great. If not, then we\u2019re done,\u201d he said.",
      "He recalled a seven-month delay in U.S. aid that ended in April 2024 but in the meantime opened a door for the Russian capture of the strategically important city of Avdiivka.",
      "Others said the move has left even greater confusion about Donald Trump\u2019s intentions.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s unclear what Trump wants and what the purpose of his actions is,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezhko, Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAs of today, it appears that he is increasingly siding with Russia and trying to pressure Ukraine into accepting Russia\u2019s demands.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis looks terrible \u2014 forcing the weaker side to accept the terms of the stronger aggressor,\u201d he told AP.",
      "Olena Fedorova, a 46-year-old resident of the southern port city of Odesa, said she hoped Trump\u2019s decision would be \u201ca temporary measure\u201d because \u201cwe really need help.\u201d",
      "The U.S.-Ukraine relationship has taken a downturn in recent weeks as Trump\u2019s team launched bilateral talks with Russia and Trump\u2019s demeanor toward Zelenskyy has become increasingly dismissive.",
      "Trump says he wants to get traction for peace negotiations. He vowed during his campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but in January changed that time frame and voiced hope that peace could be negotiated in six months.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Washington's decision could act as a spur to a peace agreement.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has been the chief supplier in this war so far,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cIf the U.S. suspends these supplies it will make the best contribution to peace.\u201d",
      "Russia will likely try to use the halt in supplies to extend its territorial gains and strengthen its position in prospective peace talks.",
      "Russia\u2019s state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who chairs the defense committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, predicting that Ukraine would exhaust its current ammunition reserves within months. \u201cWe need to keep up the pressure and continue to target their bases and depots with long-range precision weapons to destroy the stockpiles,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's European allies reaffirmed their commitment to Kyiv.",
      "The chief of the European Union\u2019s executive proposed an 800 billion euro ($841 billion) plan to beef up defenses of EU nations to lessen the impact of potential U.S. disengagement and provide Ukraine with military muscle.",
      "The British government, which has been leading European efforts to keep Trump from pushing to end the war on terms that could favor Moscow, said in a statement that it remains \u201cabsolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense think tank, said Washington\u2019s move could encourage Russia to ask for more Ukrainian concessions, including demilitarization and neutrality.",
      "\u201cThis decision is not about economics. It is driven fundamentally by Trump\u2019s view that Russia is willing to do a peace deal, and only Ukraine is the obstacle,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cBut there is no evidence that Russia would be prepared to accept a deal, and what that would be.\u201d",
      "Trump said on Monday that he is still interested in signing a deal that would hand over a share of Ukraine\u2019s minerals to the United States, an agreement that Zelenskyy has also said he is ready to sign.",
      "\u201cBy abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west,\u201d said Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group. \u201cRazom for Ukraine urges the White House to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.\u201d",

      "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi says Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory",
      "CAIRO -- Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Friday that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory.",
      "Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counterproposal to President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination. It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday are set to endorse a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain.",
      "The summit hosted by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia \u2014 countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also attended.",
      "Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.",
      "The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law.",
      "The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages \u2014 the militant group\u2019s main bargaining chip \u2014 in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 a key component of the first phase.",
      "A 112-page draft of Egypt's $53 billion plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel\u2019s bombardment and military offensives.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza\u2019s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",
      "In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building \u201csustainable, green and walkable\u201d housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.",
      "It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.",
      "Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.",
      "Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas\u2019 disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.",
      "Addressing the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that the plan \u201cpreserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.\u201d",
      "He said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a \u201ccomprehensive, just and lasting settlement\u201d to the Palestinian cause.",
      "\u201cThere will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,\u201d el-Sissi said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.\u201d",
      "An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a \u201cpermanent and just solution\u201d for the Palestinian cause, and for the U.N. Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft.",
      "Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel\u2019s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.",
      "Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern \u201cRiviera.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.",
      "A senior European Union official attending the summit said the bloc was ready to provide \u201cconcrete support\u201d for Egypt's plan.",
      "\u201cThe European Union firmly rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial changes, in Gaza, in other parts of the world. Anywhere,\u201d Antonio Costa, president of the European Commission, told the summit.",
      "The EU, he said, is \u201ccommitted to the two-state solution, where Palestine and Israel can live side-by-side in peace and security.\u201d",
      "Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the summit is \u201ca key pillar in Egypt\u2019s strategy\u201d to counter Trump's plan for Gaza.",
      "\u201cEgypt is trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is also to continue to frame this plan as part of a new push towards the two-state solution.\u201d",
      "Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan.",
      "Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members.",
      "Jordan said that the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land.",
      "The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more.",
      "Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced about 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters.",

      "A dolphin weighing more than 900 pounds appeared to fall out of the sky before landing in a small fishing boat off the coast of New Zealand, shocking the three men on board",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A placid fishing trip turned \u201cberserk\u201d for three New Zealand men when a dolphin weighing more than 400 kilograms (900 pounds) appeared to fall out of the sky before crash-landing in their small boat.",
      "No one was badly hurt when the 3.4 meter (11-foot) bottlenose dolphin jumped aboard the open-top boat Friday, said Dean Harrison, the owner of the nearly 16-foot vessel.",
      "Harrison and two companions were fishing near the Hole in the Rock, a picturesque spot off the far north coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, while dolphins frolicked ahead. The men saw a shadow across the bright summer sun and heard an almighty boom \u2014 before chaos unfolded.",
      "\u201cThis one decided to jump on board and say hello,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cOne minute everything was fine and then just like lightning striking, there\u2019s a big dolphin in our boat thrashing around and breaking everything.\"",
      "The creature\u2019s flailing snapped \u201cevery single fishing rod we had in the boat\u201d and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\u201cWe looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we\u2019ve got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s stuck in the boat for now, so he\u2019s coming along for the ride.\u201d",
      "The men alerted New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2- 3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \u201csign\u201d in the M\u0101ori language.",
      "Tohu is now also the name of Dean Harrison's boat.",
      "\u201cThe dolphin got to swim away and we got to walk away and we've all got a story to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a good ending in a situation that could have been very different.\u201d"

      "Stocks are falling again on Wall Street as companies and investors react to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on the U.S.'s biggest trading partners",
      "NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled on Wall Street Tuesday as a trade war between the U.S. and its key trading partners escalated, wiping out all the gains for the S&P 500 since Election Day.",
      "The tariffs between the U.S., China, Canada, and Mexico helped extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 1%, with nearly every sector in the benchmark index losing ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 572 points, or 1.3%, as of 12:48 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy index is approaching a 10% decline from its most recent closing high, which is what the market considers a correction. Technology stocks helped drive much of the market's gains in 2024, but have been losing ground and acting as a heavy weight so far in 2025.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",
      "The drops follow a steep sell-off Monday. Altogether, the decline has wiped out all of the markets\u2019 gains since President Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses. Worries about tariffs raising consumer prices and reigniting inflation have been weighing on both the economy and Wall Street.",
      "Imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. The 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%.",
      "Retaliations were swift.",
      "China responded to new U.S. tariffs by announcing it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Canada plans on slapping tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico also plans tariffs on goods imported from the U.S.",
      "The tariffs are prompting warnings from retailers, including Target and Best Buy, as they report their latest financial results. Target slumped 4.6% despite beating Wall Street's earnings forecasts. there will be \u201cmeaningful pressure\u201d on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Best Buy plunged 14.1% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast and warning about tariff impacts.",
      "\u201cInternational trade is critically important to our business and industry,\" said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry.",
      "Barry said China and Mexico are the top two sources for products that Best Buy sells and it also expects vendors to pass along tariff costs, which would make price increases for American consumers likely.",
      "The warnings are coming in as companies close out their latest round of earnings reports. Companies in the S&P 500 reported broad earnings growth of 18% in the fourth quarter. Wall Street has already trimmed expectations for the current quarter to about 7% growth from just over forecasts of 11% at the beginning of the year.",
      "Worries about profits follow a series of economic reports with worrisome signals that include U.S. households becoming more pessimistic about inflation and pulling back on spending. Consumer spending has essentially driven U.S. economic growth in the face of high interest rates.",
      "Wall Street has been hoping that the Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates in 2025. The central bank has signaled more caution, though, partly because of uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting later in March.",
      "The Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in two decades in order to tame inflation. It started cutting its benchmark rate in 2024 as the rate of inflation moved closer to its target of 2%. But, inflation remains stubbornly just above that target and tariffs threaten price increases that could fuel inflation.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.17% from 4.16% late Monday. It\u2019s still down sharply from last month, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries have grown about where the U.S. economy is heading.",

      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",

Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",

    "story": [
      "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world",
      "BEIJING -- When he bought an apartment near a good high school in northeast Beijing in 2020, Zhou Fujin expected that renting it out would cover most of his mortgage. But the apartment's value and the rent he is getting have plummeted in the past couple years, straining his family\u2019s finances.",
      "China is experiencing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. Cheaper prices can be a blessing for some, but deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth.",
      "Such challenges are the backdrop to the annual session of China's parliament, which begins Wednesday. It's unclear what the ruling Communist Party might do to tackle the problem, though some economists expect more government spending. Observers also will be watching for changes to the annual economic growth target, which has hovered near 5% for the past two years.",
      "These are broad, long-term problems. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods.",
      "Economy-wide, prices fell in 2023 and 2024, the longest bout of deflation since the 1960s. The gross domestic product deflator \u2013- the broadest measure of price changes in an economy -\u2013 dipped to -0.8% in the last three months of 2024, compared to -0.5% the quarter before, meaning that deflation has intensified.",
      "Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in Zhou\u2019s personal balance sheet, as it does for millions of others. Zhou\u2019s apartment, in Beijing\u2019s Miyun district, cost 2 million yuan ($275,000) when he bought it in 2020, and he financed it with an 800,000 yuan ($110,000) bank loan. The rent he charges has fallen from 2,300 yuan ($316) monthly to 1,700 yuan ($234). His monthly mortgage payment is more than 3,000 yuan ($413), and the apartment is now worth only about 1.4 million yuan ($193,000), he says.",
      "Around the time Zhou bought his apartment, the government began cracking down on excess borrowing by real estate developers, pushing the industry into crisis and many property companies into default. The father of two runs a real estate brokerage firm, which has been hemorrhaging money over the past four years. He has since expanded into home decoration services, helping him to break even.",
      "\u201cGiven that I work in the real estate sector, my income has been greatly affected,\u201d Zhou told The Associated Press. \u201cMy biggest spending is on bank mortgages, my car and my children's education. I've cut other expenditures such as travel. Even my children have realized that money is not easy to earn, and they are willing to spend less.\u201d",
      "Lu Wanyong, who owns a picture framing workshop in Beijing, says he gets only one or two customers a day, down from more than a dozen before the pandemic. Many now prefer to fix broken picture frames rather than buy new ones. Fewer new homeowners come in looking to decorate their apartments.",
      "Lu\u2019s family has burned through its savings and he fears that soon he won\u2019t be able to pay his shop\u2019s 6,000 yuan ($825) rent.",
      "\u201cI am considering shifting to other industries, but the problem is that I am not familiar with any of them. And as a matter of fact, which industry is easy to work in nowadays?\u201d he pondered.",
      "Deflation can be harder for governments to tackle than inflation, experts say, because that requires fixing the underlying issues behind it.",
      "In China\u2019s case, it\u2019s a combination of excess capacity \u2014 manufactured goods produced in such quantities the market cannot absorb them all -\u2013 and the reluctance of consumers to spend and businesses to invest, due to concerns about the sluggish economy. Also, the housing crisis has wiped out an estimated $18 trillion of household wealth, according to a Barclays report, on top of job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cWhen the real estate market is booming, people believe that they are very rich,\u201d said He-Ling Shi, an associate professor of economics at Australia's Monash University. \u201cIf people believe that they\u2019re rich, they tend to spend their income on consumption. But with the decrease in the price of housing in most parts of China, people believe that they\u2019re no longer as rich as before, so \u2026 they want to increase their savings and reduce their consumption.\u201d",
      "When prices fall, companies' profits also take a hit. That can spur a so-called \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d of layoffs that further reduce household incomes, leading to even less consumption and potentially to a recession or depression. Fitch Ratings in November warned that deflation is becoming entrenched in China and urged its leaders to adopt policies that can boost demand.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed new 20% tariffs on Chinese exports that are expected to shave up to 1.1 percentage points off China\u2019s GDP growth this year in a \u201csevere scenario\u201d where Chinese exports to the U.S. fall by half, said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group.",
      "Deflation is a ticklish issue for China\u2019s leaders, who began cutting interest rates and required mortgage down-payments last fall. They have launched programs to get local governments to buy unsold apartments to rent out as affordable housing and are encouraging banks to lend more money.",
      "But top leaders tend to focus their public comments on the ruling party's accomplishments and avoid directly mentioning deflation, a thorny problem with no quick fixes.",
      "\u201cThey try to do their best to avoid the word \u2018deflation\u2019 because they believe that will make consumers even more panicked,\u201d Shi said. \u201cIf they become more panicked, they will further reduce their consumption and therefore make the situation worse.\u201d",
      "Some economists, including Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, say the economy can only be rebalanced if consumers gain purchasing power. That requires reducing the share of wealth going into unproductive investments.",
      "The government has sought to encourage more spending by issuing vouchers, while shying away from more fundamental economic reforms.",
      "\u201cEconomic recovery should be linked to a rise in people\u2019s incomes\u201d said Sun Lijian, professor at the School of Economics at Fudan University. \u201cThe government should provide vouchers to help people purchase what they need; this has proven to be an effective way.\u201d",
      "Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist for S&P Global Ratings, says China needs to address long-term, chronic problems including excess industrial production and inefficient state industries. Revamping health care, pensions and education systems would make people \u201cmore comfortable about their financial situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the short term, simply anything that increases household incomes will help on the consumption side,\u201d Kuijs said, \u201cbut probably more importantly is that structural reform element \u2026 and that requires beefing up of the government\u2019s role in health, education and social security.\u201d",

      "Already, Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been digging a straight-line city in the desert for his $500 billion project at NEOM in Saudi Arabia\u2019s western desert on the Red Sea. He also will need to build tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of the kingdom hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, he's also pledged potentially $600 billion in U.S. investments to President Donald Trump to entice him to the kingdom on his first foreign trip as president. Saudi Arabia is also the possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "All that and OPEC+ moving toward increasing production means Saudi Arabia likely will need to take on new debt to fund the crown prince's vast ambitions.",
      "A filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange showed Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $436 billion in 2024. That compares to $440.88 billion in 2023.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices as well.",
      "\u201cThe decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue and other income related to sales, higher operating costs, as well as lower finance and other income,\u201d Aramco said in its filing.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.33 a share Tuesday, down from a high over the last year of $8.71. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Benchmark Brent crude is at $73 \u2014 down 10% this year.",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.74 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns Google.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $21.36 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a far-smaller performance dividend of $220 million. The company expects to pay dividends of $85.4 billion this year, which is far lower and will further erode cash that Saudi Arabia's monarchy can expect for the year.",
      "\u201cOur strong net income and increased base dividend illustrate Aramco\u2019s exceptional resilience,\" Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.",
      "The Aramco results come as OPEC+, an alliance of the oil cartel and other energy-producing states, met online Monday and agreed to proceed with an increase in oil production starting in April. It's the first oil production increase by the group since 2022 and likely will push down oil prices further.",
      "The OPEC+ decision follows criticism by Trump of the cartel as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.",
      "The Saudi government owns the vast majority of the firm\u2019s shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019 and has weighed offering more shares publicly.",

      "The Prada Group has posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year, bucking the luxury sector slide amid talk of a possible Versace acquisition",
      "ROME -- The Prada Group on Tuesday posted double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year, bucking the luxury sector slide amid talk of a possible Versace acquisition.",
      "The group, which owns the Prada and Miu Miu fashion brands along with Church\u2019s footwear, reported a 17% boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) last year from 4.7 billion euros in 2023. Retail sales rose 18% to 4.6 billion euros in the period.",
      "The Prada brand, which accounts for the bulk of earnings, reported sales were up a solid 4%, while they nearly doubled at younger Miu Miu. The Prada Group results are against market trends, with the luxury sector as a whole contracting last year for the first time since the Great Recession.",
      "\u201cThis success underscores the enduring relevance of our brands, which comes from an unwavering focus on product innovation, quality, craftmanship and a unique ability to read contemporaneity,\u2019\u2019 said Prada Group Chairman Patrizio Bertelli.",
      "Prada has been eyeing the possible acquisition of the rival Versace brand, owned since 2018 by the U.S. group Capri Holding, which includes Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.",
      "\u201cI think it's on everybody's table,\u2019\u2019 Miuccia Prada said after presenting Prada\u2019s Fall-Winter 2025-26 collection last week.",
      "Asked about Prada's investment plans during an analyst conference call, CEO Andrea Guerra said the company's focus is on growing its current brands, but added it would be \u201carrogant\u201d not to evaluate opportunities that present themselves. He did not mention Versace by name.",
      "Italian media have reported that the sale would value Versace at 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), a considerable discount on the $2 billion paid by Capri Holding. The current owner has been struggling to reposition the stalwart of Italian fashion, which was founded in 1978 and has been under the creative direction of Donatella Versace for more than 20 years.",
      "Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca said Prada \"may be getting Versace on the cheap,'' noting that Versace is a well-known name that complements Prada's existing brands.",
      "But he added there are obstacles to a successful acquisition.",
      "\"Prada has a very bad M&A track record,'' he said. \"Reviving Versace needs a lot of money, competence, management attention, and short-term sacrifice,'' Solca said."

      "The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago",
      "LONDON -- The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago. The suspension of that aid by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine\u2019s defenses will quickly collapse.",
      "But it's a major blow that threatens to remove some of the most formidable weapons in Ukraine\u2019s battlefield arsenal, and ratchets up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace agreement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the decision and its implications.",
      "The United States has given the Ukrainians more than $180 billion in assistance since Russia launched an all-out war on Feb. 24, 2022, including more than $66.5 billion in military aid.",
      "Washington provides about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s military supplies, and that fifth includes the most lethal and important equipment, including longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems that can shoot down the most powerful Russian projectiles.",
      "American military assistance also goes far beyond weapons and ammunition.",
      "Ukrainian troops rely on satellite communications systems supplied by Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to communicate on the front line, and on American intelligence to track Russian troop movements and select targets for Ukrainian strikes. If the U.S. stops sharing data from satellites and other assets, it would badly affect Ukraine\u2019s capability to strike back at Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s other allies lack the resources to fill the gap.",
      "\u201cA lot will depend on what\u2019s covered by the American suspension,\u201d said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of defense think-tank RUSI. \u201cWill they suspend all technical assistance to Ukraine? That would have a more dramatic, more rapid impact than simply stopping the pipeline of arms.\u201d",
      "The White House said that the U.S. is \u201cpausing and reviewing\u201d its Ukraine aid to \u201censure that it is contributing to a solution.\u201d The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The halt came days after an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that Ukraine\u2019s leader hasn't expressed sufficient gratitude for American support.",
      "The U.S. move won\u2019t have an immediate impact on the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are struggling to stem a relentless Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where Russia is slowly gaining ground at a huge human and material cost.",
      "The pause in aid will weaken air defenses and will hit Ukraine\u2019s ability to hit Russian targets far behind the front lines.",
      "Alexander Kots, a Russian war blogger, noted that while Ukraine\u2019s European allies can fill some of the gaps and provide artillery systems, they don\u2019t have alternatives to the U.S.-made Patriot and NASAMS air defense missile systems and longer-range HIMARS missile systems that can strike ground targets up to 300 kilometers (200 miles) away.",
      "Kots said that for Ukraine, \u201cthe U.S. aid suspension is unpleasant but not deadly.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has stockpiles of artillery shells and other munitions, and has ramped up domestic production of drones, which are now among the most important weapons in the war. It\u2019s estimated that just over half of the military hardware used by Ukraine is domestically produced.",
      "Chalmers, the RUSI expert, said that the Ukrainians have built up their defense production, and \u201care innovating at an incredible rate because of the pressure they\u2019re under.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they will survive for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a material blow, and it\u2019s also a challenge to Europe.\u201d",
      "A summit in London on Sunday was aimed at getting European leaders to step up and put Ukraine in the best possible position before potential peace talks.",
      "The U.K. announced that it would use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles. The European Union has proposed an 800 billion-euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster the defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle.",
      "But Samir Puri, director of the Center for Global Governance and Security at international affairs think tank Chatham House, said that European and American aid are intertwined.",
      "\u201cThis was always a joint effort,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. gives a lot, the Europeans give a lot. You take away the Americans from that joint effort and \u2026 there\u2019s just a huge component missing to the structure.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "North Carolina legislators appear to be closing in on legislation to provide more funds to help the mountains recover from Hurricane Helene",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina state Senate Republicans advanced a disaster recovery measure Tuesday to direct $533 million in additional spending to meet still-pressing needs from Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding and destruction last fall, but it also locates more relief funding for earlier storms.",
      "The legislation that cleared the Senate's budget-writing committee is wider in scope than a $500 million relief package approved unanimously last week by the House that focused on Helene's destruction in western North Carolina.",
      "Spending provisions within the Senate proposal locates an additional $217 million to complete lingering home construction projects for victims of Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018 in eastern North Carolina. The package also lays the groundwork to assist farmers who suffered agricultural losses last year \u2014 not just from Helene but also from drought and tornadoes.",
      "\u201cWe feel that we need to move with urgency to get this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Sen. Brent Jackson, a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman. \u201cCitizens across all our 100 counties faced disasters in 2024.\u201d",
      "A Senate floor vote on the chamber's bill was expected Wednesday. While House Republicans also are advancing agricultural assistance and Matthew and Florence relief in other measures, top House and Senate leaders later Tuesday said they believed they could agree upon a final supplemental disaster relief bill quickly \u2014 possibly by the end of the week \u2014 then send it to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants the same thing \u2014 to get people help,\u201d said state Rep. John Bell, who has been shepherding the House's $500 million measure.",
      "Last month, Stein offered his own $1.07 billion proposal for additional Helene relief. The amount would double the money already appropriated or made available by the General Assembly for Helene recovery activities since late last year. But GOP legislators seek to spend less now, saying they want to be careful about maximizing federal matching funds and avoiding mistakes after previous storms.",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene, which caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. More than five months later, over 5,700 households in western counties are still receiving temporary housing assistance and more than 200 public roads in the region remain closed or just partially opened, according to state data.",
      "Legislative leaders and Stein agree that more money will be allocated for Helene relief later this year in the state budget because the needs are so great, even with billions arriving from Washington.",
      "\u201cThe underlying message I want to leave with people is we\u2019re making progress but it\u2019s just a start,\u201d Stein said of Helene recovery at the monthly meeting of statewide elected officials earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis work is long term and it\u2019s going to be hard, and we all have to be there together.\u201d",
      "Like the House legislation, the Senate proposal emphasizes repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent to small businesses. The Senate plan omits a House provision that would allow $15 million to go to nonprofit organizations that could then offer grants to small businesses. Stein and fellow Democrats have pleaded for direct grants to help businesses already weighed down with loans.",
      "The Senate plan does provide money \u2014 although not as much as Stein sought \u2014 for local school districts that closed for many weeks due to Helene to offer summer school instruction. The House plan left out the program.",
      "Republican lawmakers have been angry with delays in the Florence and Matthew housing reconstruction program, which was created by then-Gov. Roy Cooper's administration and funded with federal dollars.",
      "While about 3,300 home construction projects have been completed through the state Office of Recovery and Resiliency, state funds are now needed to complete another 1,000 that remain in various stages of construction. Office leaders blamed the delays on the COVID-19 pandemic, rising construction costs, labor shortages and ultimately management mistakes. The agency's chief operating officer left her job in November.",
      "Both the Senate measure and a separate House bill also approved Tuesday in another committee provides the $217 million, but each bill requires significant monitoring and oversight requirements in how it\u2019s spent. Language in both bills would ultimately shut down the Office of Recovery and Resiliency. Stein\u2019s administration is handling Helene-related home reconstruction through a new agency.",

      "The meetings come as China\u2019s economy struggles with sluggish consumption, a lengthy property crisis, ballooning government debt and a possible renewed trade war with the United States. On Tuesday, Beijing announced additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports on U.S. farm products including chicken, pork, soy and beef. The move came in retaliation for an increase in flat U.S. tariffs on Chinese products \u2013 from 10% to 20% \u2013 that came in effect at the same time.",
      "\u201cUndoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought by the external environment have deepened, and China\u2019s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,\u201d said Lou Qinjian, spokesman for the National People\u2019s Congress in a news conference ahead of the session.",

      "China\u2019s is a major importer of American farm products. Purchases dipped after Trump launched a trade war during his first term and then recovered.",
      "Now, imports of U.S.-grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, the Chinese ministry said. Tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.",
      "The U.S. tariffs began a day before the annual session of China\u2019s parliament, which begins Wednesday and will focus in part on deflation and other issues affecting the world's second largest economy.",

      "While the tariffs on American farm products are sweeping, China held back from imposing higher ones across the board, and \u201cboth sides showed restraint,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, an international relations professor at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.",

      "Vendors are a fixture at Rio\u2019s Carnival street parties",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches\u2019 face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights.",
      "The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party \u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d.",
      "\u201cCarnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,\u201d said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival \u2014 about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage.",
      "\u201cEvery year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,\u201d she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other.",
      "Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as \u201cambulantes\u201d or \u201ccamelos,\" they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio\u2019s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands \u2014 or hundreds of thousands \u2014 of thirsty revelers.",
      "Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year.",
      "But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush \u2014 and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year\u2019s Carnival \u2014 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots.",
      "Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio\u2019s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement \u2014 known by its acronym MUCA.",
      "The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk, we felt suffocated,\u201d Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn\u2019t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers.",
      "\u201cWe support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity \u2014 there really has been a serious problem hindering the party\u2019s development,\u201d Monteiro added.",
      "Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem.",
      "Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for \u201cmess with harmony.\u201d The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community.",
      "\u201cVendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city\u2019s reputation, as causing public disorder,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Magalh\u00e3es, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. \u201cBut vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city\u2019s tourism.\u201d",
      "They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery.",
      "During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors.",
      "Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year\u2019s election to fight for greater respect for her peers, but lost.",
      "Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods.",
      "And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors\u2019 children during street parties and samba schools\u2019 parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio\u2019s department of social assistance said in an email.",
      "For D\u00e9bora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais \u2014 what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play.",
      "\u201cWe meet people and make friends. The money makes it worth it, but experiences even more so,\u201d she said."

      "Chinese manufacturers reported stronger orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- Chinese manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.",
      "Trump earlier imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from China and that will rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs, in a blow to companies whose online sales direct to consumers had soared in recent years.",
      "The Global Times, a newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Monday that Beijing was studying both tariffs and non-tariff moves to counter Trump's higher tariffs. Asked about that report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard own legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\u201d it said, citing an unnamed source. Last week, Chinese Commerce Ministry officials had said the two sides were in a \u201cdialogue\u201d about trade.",
      "The stronger-than-expected data came as Chinese leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress. Lawmakers are expected as usual to endorse policies and priorities set by the ruling Communist Party, which could include some fresh help for the economy as it slows to annual growth many economists forecast will fall to about 4.5% this year.",
      "Surveys of factory managers showed China\u2019s official purchasing managers index rose to 50.2% from 49% in January, though that was just above the 50 level that marks the break between contraction and expansion. The new orders index rose to 51.1.",
      "Steady industrial production suggests that government spending and \u201cfront running\u201d to beat the higher tariffs supported stronger business activity last month, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cBut growth still looks at risk of slowing this quarter, at least partially reversing the pick-up in Q4 (October-December). And that\u2019s before the hit from tariffs is felt in earnest,\u201d Huang wrote.",
      "Another survey released Monday, the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey, showed a similar improvement. That survey tends to show trends in smaller and export-oriented companies, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a commentary.",
      "\u201cThis could be a valuable gauge of the impact new tariffs are having on the manufacturing sector. With an additional 10% tariff set to come into effect tomorrow, this seems likely,\u201d she said.",
      "Sudden increases in tariffs and other factors have raised uncertainty over the outlook for the world's second largest economy, which grew at a 5% annual pace last year, just meeting Beijing's official target.",
      "Premier Li Qiang will present an annual work report to the congress as it opens on Wednesday that traditionally provides the annual growth target for this year, among other policies and economic updates.",
      "2025 is the last year of leader Xi Jinping's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d blueprint for upgrading Chinese industries to become global leaders in advanced technology. It also marks the end of China\u2019s 14th five-year plan, the party's traditional mid-term policy-setting document.",
      "A key priority is likely to be outlining ways to get Chinese consumers to spend more, a weak point in the state-dominated economy following the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has moved to provide more support for private industry in recent months as part of that effort. Exports and targeted spending increases have also helped."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cYou know that governments historically have messed with GDP,\u201d Lutnick said on Fox News Channel's \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThey count government spending as part of GDP. So I\u2019m going to separate those two and make it transparent.\u201d",
      "Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy's health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.",
      "Musk's efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.",
      "The commerce secretary's remarks echoed Musk\u2019s arguments made Friday on X that government spending doesn\u2019t create value for the economy.",
      "\u201cA more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform. \u201cOtherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don\u2019t make people\u2019s lives better.\u201d",
      "The argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy's trajectory.",
      "\u201cIf the government buys a tank, that\u2019s GDP,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cBut paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we\u2019re going to get rid of that.\u201d",
      "The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.",
      "The report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government's component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.",
      "In the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people's personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people's personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.",
      "The government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.",
      "Lutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.",
      "\u201cWhen we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThis is going to be the best economy anybody\u2019s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.\u201d"

      "Car industry analysts say it's too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It's best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world's EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.",
      "But, if anything, that makes Musk\u2019s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.",
      "\u201cMusk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\u201c said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cTesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\u201d",
      "The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.",
      "More worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla\u2019s individual models. Sales of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait",
      "\u201cPart of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,\u201d said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts.",

      "His decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump's presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump's government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.",

      "The recently announced U.S. tariffs on steel imports mean that countries like China, which export to the U.S., will need to find new markets \u2014 and that could lead to steel dumping in places like India",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Rows of small factories line the streets of a dusty suburb in Bengaluru, where workers weld and cast Indian-made steel into everything from car parts to kitchen sinks. Here, U.S. President Trump\u2019s announcement to impose high trade tariffs on steel imports has some unexpected supporters.",
      "Many industry workers and experts expect that the result of tariffs will be that cheap steel gets dumped in places like India. That's because the announced 25% tariff will make it too expensive for many companies in countries like China and South Korea to keep exporting to the U.S.",
      "For B. Praveen of Sun Techpro Engineering, which makes products from steel metal sheets, it means his \u201cwafer-thin\u201d profit margins will probably grow as the steel he buys gets cheaper.",
      "\u201cFor thousands of companies like mine, this can be a good thing,\u201d he said. Businesses such as Praveen's employ over 200 million Indians and are key drivers of India's economy.",
      "But cheaper steel in India isn't good for everyone. In February Naveen Jindal, the president of the Indian Steel Association, which represents all India\u2019s steelmakers, said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d especially since \u201cIndia is one of the few major markets without any trade restrictions,\u201d making it a target for potential steel dumping. And the increased competition could impact efforts by India to produce its own steel more cleanly. The current production of most Indian steel releases high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. Reduction efforts could be cut in the interest of keeping profits up.",
      "India is the world\u2019s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing major economies. Steel demand is rising rapidly due to fast-paced urbanization, infrastructure, and industrial growth, and the government expects steel production to increase from 120 million tons to 300 million tons in the next five years.",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India's greenhouse gas emissions come from steelmaking according to the Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks energy projects around the globe. It found this could likely double in five years if more steel is produced as per the government's plans.",
      "Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM, explained that unlike China, Europe, or the United States, Indian steelmakers still mostly use coal-based blast furnaces to make steel, which are more high-emitting. In September last year, the Indian government said it would invest $1.72 billion to help the steel industry transition to cleaner methods of steelmaking.",
      "But Khadeeja said all the new steel expansion plans that have been announced are for coal-based steel production facilities. \u201cRight now, the focus is mostly on producing as much steel as possible. The strategy is mostly to retroactively decarbonize the steel once the capacity is built in place,\" she said.",
      "Building more coal-based blast furnaces make it more difficult for India to export its steel in the future, particularly to Europe, said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collective. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a tax on carbon emissions that Europe will begin charging for all products imported to the bloc from next year, would likely turn off any buyers from steel made with coal-based blast furnaces.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s steel production is less emissions-intensive, which means it\u2019s going to face a lesser impact from European carbon taxes,\u201d said Narassimhan. \u201cAny amount of short-term pain today is going to be worth in the long run.\"",
      "India too has ambitious climate goals and wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "India also aims to go net zero \u2014 that is to stop adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere, either by preventing the emissions in the first place or removing an equivalent amount through natural or technological means \u2014 by 2070.",
      "Indian steelmakers said they recognize the need to emit less but are apprehensive about how much it'll cost them. \u201cIf you're not financially viable, you cannot exist as a business,\u201d said Prabodh Acharya, chief sustainability officer at JSW Group, one of India's biggest steel companies.",
      "\u201cSteel is essential for the growth of society and economy. We need to find the right balance between growth, economy and decarbonization,\u201d he said.",

      "Iran\u2019s parliament has impeached the country\u2019s economy minister and voted to remove him from office, amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s parliament on Sunday impeached the country\u2019s economy minister and voted to remove him from office, amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.",
      "Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati, just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s government took office.",
      "Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.",
      "The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.",
      "During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.",
      "Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.",
      "This latest development is another chapter in Iran\u2019s ongoing political and economic struggles as the country continues to navigate a complex relationship with both its leadership and the international community."

      "Kroger said its board was made aware of the situation on Feb. 21 and immediately hired an outside independent counsel to conduct an investigation, overseen by a special board committee.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia \u201cis still very, very far away,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that he expects to keep receiving American support despite his recent fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it\u2019s more than an occasional relationship,\u201d Zelenskyy said late Sunday, referring to Washington\u2019s support for the past three years of war.",

      "He said that he had watched the scene repeatedly. \u201cMy assessment is that it wasn\u2019t a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\u201d Merz said.",
      "He said that he was \u201csomewhat astonished by the mutual tone,\u201d but there has been \u201ca certain continuity to what we are seeing from Washington at the moment\u201d in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI would advocate for us preparing to have to do a great, great deal more for our own security in the coming years and decades,\u201d he said.",

      "So many world championship belts. Ngamba wants one of her own.",
      "\u201cI saw Natasha Jonas and Lauren Price and Caroline Dubois with their belts, and I remember saying \u2018Oh, that looks nice, I would love to have one of them,'\" she said.",
      "Achieving goals is kind of Ngamba\u2019s thing. At the Paris Games, she became the first athlete competing as a refugee to earn a medal when she took bronze in the middleweight category.",
      "A decade ago the Cameroon\u2014born Ngamba thought she was about to be deported from Britain. Now she's set to make her professional debut at Royal Albert Hall. She\u2019s facing veteran Kirstie Bavington in a super welterweight bout in London as part of an all-female card headlined by the Jonas vs. Price welterweight world title unification fight.",

      "Ngamba had arrived in Britain at age 11 \u2014 her father and siblings live here, too \u2014 in Bolton, just north of Manchester, and set about learning English and trying to fit in. She picked up boxing at age 15, and it became an escape from the stress of worrying about her residency status.",
      "She described being arrested as a teenager while checking in at an immigration center in Manchester.",
      "\u201cMy case was still pending. I applied and they rejected it. When they reject your case, you have to go and re-apply again. I was in a situation where even though I was re-applying every time, they could have arrested me at any moment,\" she said. \u201cI visualized that they could arrest me in the street or in my house, in school or with my friends. I never knew it was going to be at an immigration center where I usually (went) every weekend.\u201d",
      "Worried she would be deported, she thought to herself: \"'I have no one in Cameroon, no family in Cameroon. Who is going to take care of me?\u2019\u201d",
      "She was held overnight at a detention facility in London before being released.",
      "Ngamba, who came out as gay when she was 18, eventually won her case and was given refugee status. Same-sex relations in Cameroon can result in prison sentences of five years in the country.",
      "Her progress in the boxing ring \u2014 Ngamba was an England amateur champion at three different weights \u2014 attracted the attention of Britain\u2019s elite development program. Ngamba was brought in to spar the likes of Jonas, Price and others in hopes that she would eventually compete for Britain.",
      "Ngamba, one of the flagbearers for the Olympic refugee team at the opening ceremony in Paris, is still treated as one of their own at \u201cGB Boxing.\u201d After the Olympics, her name was added to the wall of fame at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, and she joined British Olympians at a Buckingham Palace reception where she meet King Charles III.",
      "The main attraction is a welterweight clash of generations with 40-year-old Natasha Jonas facing 30-year-old Lauren Price.",
      "Both are former Olympians. Welsh boxer Price (8-0) won a gold medal for Britain at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. She is the WBA champion.",
      "Jonas (16-2-1), of Liverpool, competed at the 2012 London Games when women\u2019s boxing made its debut in the Olympic program. She fell just short of a medal when she lost to Ireland\u2019s Katie Taylor in the quarterfinals. Jonas holds the WBC and IBF welterweight titles.",
      "American boxer Mikaela Mayer holds the other major welterweight belt \u2014 the WBO championship.",
      "WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois is also on the card. Dubois, whose older brother Daniel is the IBF heavyweight champion, will face Bo Mi Re Shin of South Korea.",
      "It\u2019s the second all-female event by promotion company Boxxer and Sky Sports following their October 2022 event at a sold-out O2 Arena (20,000 capacity) in London. Sky said that event had a TV audience of more than 2 million in Britain and Ireland.",

      "Quintana, 36, is coming off a 2024 season in which he went 10-10 with a 3.75 ERA in 31 starts for the New York Mets. He struck out 135 and walked 63 in 170 1/3 innings. Over his last six regular-season starts, Quintana gave up four runs \u2014 three earned \u2014 in 36 1/3 innings.",
      "He started the deciding game of New York\u2019s NL Wild Card Series matchup with the Brewers and pitched six shutout innings in the Mets\u2019 4-2 victory, though he received no decision. Quintana had a total of three postseason starts, allowing six runs \u2014 five earned \u2014 over 14 1/3 innings.",
      "Quintana now will compete for a spot in a Brewers rotation that returns right-handers Freddy Peralta, Tobias Myers and Aaron Civale. The two-time defending NL Central champions also added left-hander Nestor Cortes in a trade that sent two-time NL reliever of the year Devin Williams to the New York Yankees.",
      "The Brewers could use some rotation depth as two-time All-Star Brandon Woodruff and Robert Gasser come back from injuries. Woodruff missed all of 2024 while recovering from shoulder surgery, and he won\u2019t be ready for the start of the season. Gasser, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, isn\u2019t expected to be available until late in the season.",
      "Milwaukee got more bad news Monday night when left-hander Aaron Ashby, a candidate for a rotation spot, left his start against the Cincinnati Reds with an injury. Murphy told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Ashby appeared to have an oblique issue and would undergo an MRI.",
      "When he makes his Brewers debut, Quintana will have pitched for every team in the NL Central. He was with the Chicago Cubs from 2017-20 and split the 2022 season between the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.",
      "Quintana owns a 102-103 record and 3.74 ERA in 359 career appearances, including 333 starts. He\u2019s also had stints with the Chicago White Sox (2012-17), Los Angeles Angels (2021), San Francisco Giants (2021) and Mets (2023-24). He was selected to the All-Star Game in 2016.",

      "The defending Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers made their first big move ahead of the NHL trade deadline by acquiring hard-nosed forward Trent Frederic from the Boston Bruins on Tuesday.",
      "Edmonton sent a 2025 second- and a 2026 fourth-round pick and prospect Max Wanner to Boston for the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder, with the Bruins retaining half of Frederic's $2.3 million salary. The New Jersey Devils retained another quarter and received the rights to unsigned draft pick Shane Lachance from the Oilers and Petr Hauser from the Bruins in return.",
      "Trading Frederic is the first sell-off by the Bruins, who are among the teams vying for the final couple of playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Captain Brad Marchand, like Frederic, is a pending free agent, though he has said he would like to play his entire career with Boston and also was injured last weekend and is considered week to week.",
      "Getting the 27-year-old provides Edmonton some much-needed toughness with the aim of helping Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and company make another long playoff run this spring, a year after reaching Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final and losing to Florida. In addition to adding Frederic at a bargain cap hit of $575,000 \u2014 under the league minimum \u2014 the Oilers also got depth forward Max Jones in this deal.",
      "The deadline is Friday at 3 p.m. EST.",
      "One player who seemingly now will not be on the move is Jake Evans, who signed a four-year, $11.4 million contract extension to remain with the Montreal Canadiens beyond this season.",

      "Specifically, a slideshow during a presentation to Clemson's trustees reported the exit fee would be $165 million for the 2026 fiscal year, but would descend by $18 million per year until leveling off around $75 million for the 2030-31 season. While a grant-of-rights agreement gives the league control of a school's media rights, the deal would allow a school to exit with its media rights after paying the exit fee, according to that presentation.",

      "Stephen Curry had 28 points and nine assists while running his personal record to 12-1 at Madison Square Garden, and the Golden State Warriors beat the New York Knicks 114-102",
      "NEW YORK -- Stephen Curry had 28 points and nine assists while running his personal record to 12-1 at Madison Square Garden, and the Golden State Warriors beat the New York Knicks 114-102 on Tuesday night.",
      "Jimmy Butler and Brandin Podziemski added 19 points apiece for the Warriors, who improved to 3-1 on their five-game trip. It feels like home for them on the Knicks' floor, where they have won 12 of the last 14 times.",
      "Draymond Green finished with eight points, nine rebounds and eight assists on his 35th birthday.",
      "OG Anunoby scored 29 points and Jalen Brunson had 25 for the Knicks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. They played without All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns, who was out for personal reasons. Coach Tom Thibodeau said before the game he didn't know if Towns would be with the team when it left for a five-game trip that starts Thursday against the Lakers.",
      "Warriors: Playing for the second straight night after winning in Charlotte on Monday, Curry didn't seem bothered by the right ankle soreness he experienced in that game and played 33 minutes.",
      "Knicks: Without the ability to get inside offense from Towns, the Knicks couldn't overcome their 8-for-33 shooting (24%) from 3-point range. Mitchell Robinson started at center in just his third game this season after returning from ankle surgery but played only 15 minutes while working his way back.",
      "Curry and Brunson re-entered the game with Golden State leading by one with 6:33 remaining. The Warriors ran off an 11-0 spurt, holding the Knicks scoreless for four minutes, to make it 105-93 with 2:39 to play.",
      "Curry scored 20 in the second half and Butler had 13.",
      "The Warriors remain in New York to visit Brooklyn on Thursday. The Knicks start their five-game trip that night in Los Angeles.",

      "Lewis Hamilton\u2019s impact stretches far beyond Formula 1 and his quest to win a record-breaking eighth world title with his new team",
      "Met Gala chair, co-producer on a Brad Pitt movie, activist, and now Ferrari driver.",
      "Lewis Hamilton's impact stretches far beyond Formula 1 and his quest to win a record-breaking eighth world title with his new team.",
      "The partnership of F1's biggest celebrity \u2014 and only Black driver \u2014 with its biggest brand reaches people who don't consider themselves F1 fans, and may not even have watched a race.",
      "In some respects, Hamilton's move is already a marketing triumph. He won't race for Ferrari until next week in Australia, ending 13 months of hype since he announced his decision to leave Mercedes.",
      "\u201cObviously the commercial success and the success for Ferrari\u2019s brand has been unprecedented,\u201d Michael E. Sawyer, author of an upcoming biography of Hamilton, \u201cSir Lewis,\u201d told The Associated Press. \u201cIt just makes the brand that much more iconic. It\u2019s always been about pushing boundaries.\"",
      "Expectations are high, too, around Hamilton's potential impact in Italy in terms of representation and creating opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds.",
      "\u201cWhen it was announced that (Hamilton) was in Ferrari, the industry started thinking, especially in fashion, that things would start changing,\u201d Michelle Francine Ngonmo, the founder of Afro Fashion Week Milano and an advocate for diversity in Italian fashion, told the AP.",
      "Hamilton\u2019s first photos as a Ferrari employee were curated to perfection. His sometimes-playful fashion sense took a traditional turn with a sharp double-breasted suit as he posed in front of company founder Enzo Ferrari\u2019s house.",
      "Hamilton's celebrity status extended beyond F1 years ago. Where other drivers arrive for a race weekend in branded team gear, he turns up in high fashion.",
      "His friendships with influential fashion figures, involvement with the Met Gala \u2014 he's a chair for this year's event in May \u2014 and a co-producer role on the upcoming Hollywood movie \u201cF1\u201d all allow Hamilton to reach non-sports audiences in a way other drivers can't.",
      "With so much attention on their new partnership, the 40-year-old Hamilton and Ferrari could risk disappointment if he doesn't win the long-sought-after eighth title.",
      "Hamilton was broadly on pace with rivals and his teammate Charles Leclerc over three days of preseason testing in Bahrain last week. Still, Hamilton said he and Ferrari have \"definitely got some work to do to improve.\u201d",
      "Hamilton has indicated he needs time to adapt, but one key rival has argued a successful start will be key to keep Ferrari's passionate fans on board.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll love him if he\u2019s quick and he delivers and he\u2019ll feed off that energy,\u201d Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said last month. \"If it doesn\u2019t get off to a good start, then it\u2019ll inevitably be harder for him.\u201d",
      "Hamilton has always brought his own perspective to the sport.",
      "His advocacy on racism, police violence, LGBTQ rights and environmental causes has reached audiences around the world, and put the spotlight on human rights in many of the countries where F1 goes racing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always fighting for diversity,\u201d Hamilton said Tuesday at Ferrari\u2019s Fiorano test track. \u201cThe sport needs to become more and more inclusive. We are working towards that. Obviously it\u2019s very diverse, the audience, from all over the world, but access and opportunity into the actual sport, it\u2019s not easy for people from different backgrounds to get in.\u201d",
      "Hamilton also spent his time at Mercedes working behind the scenes to increase inclusion within the team and promote science and technology careers among children from diverse backgrounds. He said last year he wanted to do the same at Ferrari and that the team was \u201csuper excited\u201d to participate. No details have been released yet.",
      "\u201cIt would be great for the community here in Italy to actually see these kind of initiatives being implemented, going beyond the words,\u201d Ngonmo said.",
      "The size and potentially long-term nature of Ferrari's commitment to Hamilton is a sign the company \"understands without any question the things that he\u2019s concerned about,\u201d said Sawyer, Hamilton\u2019s biographer. \u201cI think Ferrari and Lewis went into this with their eyes open. They know exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Sawyer, who is associate professor of African American literature and culture at the University of Pittsburgh, said one way to illustrate Hamilton's impact in Italy was in comparison with soccer greats.",
      "The buzz around Hamilton is similar to when Diego Maradona played for Napoli in the 1980s, Sawyer suggested, but also cautioned that Italy hasn't always treated Black athletes warmly, pointing to the racism faced by Italian soccer player Mario Balotelli.",
      "In an interview with Time last month, Hamilton said he's thought about soccer racism in Italy in the context of joining Ferrari. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it definitely crossed my mind when I was thinking about my decision,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cLike in so many things, it\u2019s often such a small group of people that set that trend for many. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d",
      "One way Hamilton has already endeared himself to Italians is by using Italian words and phrases in interviews, something Ngonmo welcomes.",
      "\u201cI think he is trying to make people understand,\" she said, \"that Italy could be a place where everyone can belong.\"",

      "The game hasn\u2019t gotten easy for the Los Angeles Lakers since the trade deadline. It just looks that way.",
      "Consider this moment from Sunday night\u2019s win over the Clippers: Jaxson Hayes got a defensive rebound, handed the ball to Luka Doncic, who took one step forward and fired a 75-foot two-hand chest pass downcourt to LeBron James \u2014 who caught it in stride and capped the play with an easy layup.",
      "Touchdown, Lakers. And Doncic and James have had a play like that in just about every game lately, or so it would seem.",
      "A month or so has passed since The Trade \u2014 Doncic leaving the Dallas Mavericks and joining the Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis \u2014 and the Lakers suddenly look like title contenders. They are a league-best 16-3 since Jan. 20 and went into Tuesday's games sitting in the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference, a place that until now they hadn't been since about the first week of the season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThe atmosphere has been unbelievable, and we just want to give the people what they want, and that\u2019s winning the games. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s win was the 1,000th in which James has appeared in his regular season career, making him the fourth player to appear in that many victories after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,074), Robert Parish (1,013) and Tim Duncan (1,001). And now, another milestone: James is one point away from 50,000 for his career when combining regular-season and postseason games, and that bridge will almost certainly be crossed Tuesday night against New Orleans.",
      "Only two other players \u2014 Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone \u2014 have scored at least 40,000 points when adding in playoffs. And technically, James is already over 50,000 but his 99 points from play-in tournament games and the 2023 NBA Cup title game (then just called the in-season tournament) don\u2019t count.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest competitors. \u2026 He\u2019s amazing to coach,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \u201cHe brings it every single day. He sets the standard for how you\u2019re supposed to approach this craft and to me, that\u2019s the most incredible thing.\u201d",
      "There were other trades before the deadline that teams are seeing dividends from, including Golden State and Cleveland. The jury\u2019s still out in Dallas because Davis was injured when he got there \u2014 then got hurt again in his sensational debut game with the Mavs. And the injury woes for Dallas continued Monday night when Kyrie Irving left with a sprained knee.",
      "Time, and more accurately playoff results, will be the real gauge on all these moves.",
      "But for James and the Lakers, everything is looking as good as can be. The team will host Southern California first responders and affected community members Tuesday as part of the continued response to the wildfires that devastated parts of Los Angeles earlier this winter. The wins are piling up. The milestones keep coming. They keep rising in the standings.",
      "\u201cI think we could be really good going down the stretch,\u201d James said at the All-Star Game.",
      "He\u2019s been proved right again.",
      "After Golden State\u2019s acquisition of Jimmy Butler from Miami the Warriors are still hovering around the play-in line in an absolutely jammed race for spots 6 through 10 in the West. Butler\u2019s mere presence, however seems to have given the Warriors a boost.",
      "He demands defenses to respect him, which is excellent news for Stephen Curry \u2014 who had a 56-point game last week in Orlando on a night when Butler wasn\u2019t much of an offensive factor.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still unique skillsets in this league at the superstar level,\u201d Curry said of Butler. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a guy that has clearly defined a style that impacts winning at both ends of the floor. You see how much he\u2019s helped us so far. \u2026 He\u2019s succeeded at the highest level. He\u2019s gone to two finals and he\u2019s motivated more than ever to try to get back there.\u201d",
      "The Cavaliers made a very savvy move before the trade window closed, adding De\u2019Andre Hunter from Atlanta. The Cavs were good before the trade. They\u2019re even better after.",
      "Entering Monday, the Cavs were 8-0 with Hunter in the lineup \u2014 winning those eight games by an average of nearly 19 points. One of the few close ones was Sunday, when Cleveland had to dig deep to rally past Portland with Hunter leading the way.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think we were going to win the game. De\u2019Andre really took us from the abyss,\u201d Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said.",

      "James reached 50,000 points deep into his 22nd season, which ties him with Vince Carter for the most played in NBA history. Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 seasons, is second in NBA history with 44,149 combined points.",
      "And while nearly every other NBA player who lasted to his late 30s finished at a fraction of his peak powers, James' game shows no significant signs of decline in his 40s. He was named the NBA's Western Conference player of the month earlier Tuesday after he averaged 29.3 points, 10.5 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.2 steals in February while playing more than 35 minutes per game for the Lakers, who went 9-2 to surge into second place in the West.",
      "James began Tuesday at third in NBA history with 1,547 regular-season games played, trailing only Robert Parish (1,611) and Abdul-Jabbar (1,560). If he stays healthy and elects to return for a record 23rd season, he will likely surpass Parish next winter.",
      "James has also played in 287 postseason games, the most in NBA history. He became the league's career playoff scoring leader on May 25, 2017, when he surpassed Michael Jordan's total of 5,987 during the Cleveland Cavaliers' Eastern Conference finals game at Boston.",
      "James then became the top scorer in regular-season history on Feb. 7, 2023, when he topped Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38,387 points during the Lakers' game against Oklahoma City.",
      "James' prolific scoring is due in large part to his metronomic consistency. With his performance against the Clippers, he has scored at least 10 points in 1,277 consecutive games since Jan. 6, 2007 \u2014 by far the longest such streak in NBA history.",
      "James' player of the month award for February was his 41st, extending his own league record. He also became the oldest player to win the award, surpassing a 37-year-old Karl Malone in November 2000.",

      "Fans must now wait days or weeks for the full picture to come into view, though the combine still was filled with interesting twists and intriguing plots that will be discussed between now and the draft, which begins in Green Bay on April 24.",
      "Here's a look at some of the top stories from the combine:",
      "Armand Membou, OT, Missouri. He came to Indy in the mix to be the first offensive lineman drafted this year, and after measuring in at 6-foot-4, 332 pounds he dazzled with his athleticism. Membou ran the 40-yard dash in 4.91 seconds, led all offensive linemen with a broad jump of 9 feet, 7 inches and had a 34-inch vertical jump. That should be enough to cement his status as a high first-round pick.",
      "Shemar Stewart, DE, Texas A&M. It was another big guy on the opposite side of the ball who stole the spotlight on the first night of workouts. He put up elite numbers in the 40 \u2014 a time of 4.59 and a 10-yard split of 1.58 seconds \u2014 before posting a broad jump of 10-1 to go with a 40-inch vertical jump. All four numbers were top five in his position group, and he should be moving up the rankings between now and draft day.",
      "Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa State. The 5-foot-10, 194-pound receiver certainly appeared to have something to prove this weekend \u2014 and he did. Noel was one of the few players to participate in every test and he aced them all. He was one of a record 10 receivers with a sub-4.4 40, finishing in 4.39 with a 10-yard split of 1.51. He had the best vertical (41 1/2) and top broad jump (11-2) at his position and even did a group-best 23 reps on the bench press. His 20-yard shuttle (4.17) and three-cone drill (6.82) times also made the top five. And a strong showing catching passes made it a good weekend for Noel.",
      "Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama. With Jalon Walker of Georgia sitting out, Campbell quickly became the feature attraction in his position group. He didn't disappoint in the three drills he tried. Campbell's 4.52 time in the 40 was third among linebackers, just a few ticks off Kain Medrano's group-leading 4.46. Only two linebackers bettered Campbell's 10-yard split, 1.53, and he finished second in the broad jump at 10-7. He may not go ahead of Walker but his workout might help narrow the gap.",
      "Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky. After missing five games with a shoulder injury last season, Hairston made a splashy entrance at Lucas Oil Stadium. On the second night of workouts, he ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds \u2014 the fastest overall time all week \u2014 and only one cornerback topped his 10-yard split of 1.5. Hairston's encore was a 39 1/2-inch vertical jump and a broad jump of 10-9, finishing second and third in those tests, respectively.",
      "Nick Emmanwori, S, South Carolina. The 220-pound safety came within a whisker of sweeping the top spot in all four drills in which he participated. He had the best 10-yard split time, 1.49, the best broad jump (11-6), the top vertical jump (43) and a 40 time of 4.38, second only to Marcus Sigle of Kansas State who ran it in 4.37. His draft stock should be soaring as the next phase of pre-draft evaluations begins.",
      "Will Campbell, OT, LSU. A strong overall workout Sunday may have solidified Campbell's spot among top tackles. But some scouts worry Campbell's arms are shorter than the preferred 33-inch length for a tackle. He can alleviate more concerns on his pro day.",
      "Kaleb Johnson, RB, Iowa. Some thought Johnson was a top-five back prior to the combine. But Johnson decided to participate in just the 40-yard dash and his time of 4.57 seconds was only better than four other running backs. A better pro day showing would help.",
      "Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama. When last season started, some thought the athletic Crimson Tide quarterback might be a first-round pick. Instead, his stock steadily declined during the season and an uneven throwing performance in Indy may create more doubts.",
      "Mike Green, Edge, Marshall. He's believed to be a first-round talent, but the questions about Green have less to do with what he does on the field than what happened off it. Green told reporters Wednesday he transferred from Virginia after a second sexual assault allegation, something team officials probably will dig into more now \u2014 if they hadn't already.",
      "Jack Bech, WR, TCU. The player with perhaps the most inspirational story in Indy \u2014 his older brother, Tiger, was killed in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans \u2014 didn't run the 40 but showed he was strong, tough and physical enough to warrant being drafted.",
      "Riley Leonard, QB, Notre Dame. After leading the Fighting Irish to a national runner-up finish, Leonard went to work on cleaning up his footwork and midrange and deep throws. He looked more polished in Indy. The question is whether he can demonstrate more improvement at his pro day.",
      "Harold Fannin Jr., TE/H-back, Bowling Green. Last season, he broke FBS single-season records for receptions and yards receiving by a tight end. His top regular-season games came against Texas A&M and Penn State, too. What he did Thursday was show he could run, with a time of 4.71, sixth best among tight ends.",
      "Marcus Yarns, RB, Delaware. The former FCS star proved he belonged on the big stage. The 5-11, 193-pound back had a 4.45 in the 40, a top-10 finish in the 10-yard split and vertical jump and a solid showing in the on-field position workouts.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m officially now one of the people trying to buy TikTok US \u2014 and bring it on-chain,\u201d Ohanian said in a series of posts made Tuesday on X, referencing a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that Project Liberty says it will leverage to provide users more control over their online data.",
      "If successful in its bid, Project Liberty said the technology \u201cwill serve as the backbone of the redesigned TikTok, ensuring that privacy, security, and digital independence are no longer optional but foundational.\u201d When asked by an X user on Monday what he would call TikTok if he purchased it, Ohanian said: \u201cTikTok: Freedom Edition.\u201d",
      "Under a federal bill passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by former President Joe Biden last year, TikTok was required to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban by Jan. 19.",

      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",

      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "Teaching machines in the way that animal trainers mold the behavior of dogs or horses has been an important method for developing artificial intelligence and one that was recognized Wednesday with the top computer science award.",
      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",

      "Extinction is still forever",
      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

      "During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams' return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",

      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",

      "While the price of eggs was consistently rising due to inflation under Biden's administration, the first significant price hike occurred in 2022, when bird flu began infecting flocks of birds in the U.S. Egg prices rose from $1.93 per dozen to $4.82 per dozen over the course of just that one year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

      "Trump has reason to celebrate winning both the Electoral College and the popular vote. In fact, he became only the second Republican to win the popular vote since 1988, after George W. Bush in his 2004 reelection win. Trump won each of the seven battleground states that political analysts said would decide the election.",
      "In addition, the vast majority of U.S. counties saw their margins shift in Trump's direction, both in places where Republicans historically do well and places where Democrats generally have an edge.On the other hand, Trump's margins of victory \u2014 both in raw votes and in percentages \u2014 were small by historical standards, even for the past quarter century, when close elections have been the rule, including the 2000 Florida recount election and Trump's previous two races in 2016 and 2020.",
      "Trump's victory also came without a big boost for down-ballot Republicans. Republicans lost a little ground in the House, which was already narrowly divided, and while Republicans flipped the Senate, Democrats won four Senate races in key battleground states even as former Vice President Kamala Harris was losing those states to Trump.",

      "That's untrue.",
      "The Trump administration defended the decision to withdraw from the climate agreement, in part, based on projections by consultant NERA Economic Consulting. It concluded that restrictions on fossil fuel emissions would result in a higher cost of production, and a higher cost of production would translate into the closure of uncompetitive manufacturing businesses. Those closures, in turn, would mean fewer manufacturing jobs.",
      "The consultant estimated that these losses and their knock-on effects beyond the manufacturing sector would amount to 1.1 million jobs lost by 2025 and 6.5 million by 2040. The loss of jobs results in a corresponding decline in gross domestic product, with a loss of $250 billion by 2025 that accelerates to $3 trillion by 2040.",
      "So the climate agreement wasn't costing the U.S. trillions of dollars. It hypothetically could.",

      "Tariff fallout could become a rallying cry for Democrats ahead of the midterms.",
      "In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Donald Trump downplayed the growing economic concerns around his newly announced tariffs.",
      "\u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\u201d Trump said. He later added, \u201cThere'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much.\u201d",
      "That was his only reference to unease that tariffs could send already-rising prices soaring.",

      "\u201cWe inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The refusal to acknowledge the potential impact of his actions is politically risky. The cost of living won\u2019t become less important to the American people. The constant reminder of increasing prices at the grocery store checkout or the gas pump won\u2019t be easily forgotten. Price hikes may be more than a \u201clittle disturbance\u201d for those trying to make ends meet.",

      "Any proposal is unlikely to win Russian support if it includes the deployment of European forces into Ukraine, Lukashenko said.",

      "But the Belarusian leader also countered attacks by Trump and Putin on the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while offering Belarus as a location for peace negotiations. Unsuccessful ceasefire talks were held in Belarus in the hours and days after Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.",

      "Leaders in Kyiv have framed the proposed and contentious U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal as a means to securing long-term American backing, and as a possible bridge to lasting U.S. security guarantees. Lukashenko suggested that the deal, which seems to have become a cornerstone of Trump's Ukraine strategy, may unsettle the Kremlin.",
      "\"I have not discussed these issues with Russia and Putin,\" he said. \"But, most likely, this could be alarming if Russia feels that these agreements will go beyond the framework of economic relations.\"",
      "Lukashenko repeatedly appealed directly to Trump, who he described as an \"incredible person\" and a political \"bulldozer.\"",
      "The Belarusian leader also encouraged the U.S. to align closer with Russia -- a prospect that has unsettled European and Ukrainian leaders since Trump's return to the White House. Indeed, Trump's decision this week to freeze all U.S. military aid to Ukraine left officials in Kyiv and across Europe reeling.",
      "\"The U.S. is the first country in the world, high-tech, rich,\" Lukashenko said. \"They are capable of many things. Russia understands this. And Russia will strive to establish very good relations with the United States of America.\"",
      "\"In order for the planet to be in balance, so that there are no incomprehensible wars, like in the Middle East or in Ukraine, so that there are no conflicts, an alliance between Russia and the United States is possible and very important,\" he added. \"An alliance for economic development. It is possible and important. It will last a long time.\"",
      "The Belarusian leader appeared to chastise Trump for his unique political style, warning that the president must deliver on his promises.",
      "\"There are too many statements that should not have been made at all,\" Lukashenko said. \"You need to cool down after the elections. And you need to take steps in the interests of U.S. voters, first of all, and, secondly, the entire world community.\"",
      "\"You don't have much time to prove to American society that you are capable of something,\" he continued. \"If you don't do this, the Republicans will suffer a crushing defeat in the next elections. And it will be justified.\"",

      "After members of his incoming administration worked with members of the Biden administration to secure a ceasefire deal in Gaza, Trump was able to reenter the White House with a major diplomatic win already under his belt.",
      "Now, 44 days after that agreement went into effect, it seems to be at greater risk of falling apart than ever.",
      "Israel revealed on Sunday that the U.S. had offered up another proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which would significantly speed up the release of hostages.",
      "After Hamas rejected the plan, Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, a move the Trump administration has backed but other key mediators, such as Egypt and Qatar, have decried as a violation of humanitarian law.",
      "The State Department said on Monday that Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, is planning to travel to the Middle East this week and that he would seek either to \"work out a way to extend phase I or advance to phase II\" of the Gaza ceasefire deal.",
      "Trump's address on Tuesday may offer clarity on what the president would actually like to see happen next in the peace process -- beyond his outlandish plan to build what has called the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" in Gaza.",
      "If the Israel-Hamas war doesn't get airtime during Trump's speech, that, too, could be telling about the president's focus. But on Tuesday, Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in order to \"underscore that the United States' steadfast support for Israel is a top priority for President Trump,\" according to the State Department.",
      "On the day of Trump's address, the president's long-threatened 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect, prompting both countries to vow to take retaliatory economic measures -- and subsequently leading to the president promising to raise tariffs further.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. introduced another 10% tariff on Chinese imports, and Beijing hit back with its own tariffs on U.S. agricultural products and other measures targeting American business interests.",
      "The immediate impact of the multifront trade wars has been a blow to the U.S. stock market, which Trump often uses as a barometer of his own success.",
      "Economists say U.S. consumers may feel the crunch from tariffs more acutely as time goes on, as retailers are expected to offset costs by raising prices.",
      "Beyond inflating prices, Joshua P. Meltzer, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, argued the tariffs will also run counter to the Trump administration's other economic aims.",
      "\"These tariffs will also harm the Trump administration's goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China,\" he said. \"The tariffs are directly at odds with deeper economic integration across North America. In fact, China will benefit from a trade war across North America as it undercuts efforts to reshore supply chains away from China.\"",
      "Meltzer also said the move will hurt American credibility.",
      "\"They signal to the world that any international agreement with the U.S. is not worth all that much, raising difficult questions for all U.S. allies and trading partners about the value of trade agreements with the U.S.,\" he said.",

      "On Feb. 27, Trump alleged that illicit drugs such as fentanyl had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.",
      "Since September, nearly all fentanyl seized by the U.S. came through the Southern border with Mexico, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, a federal agency. Less than 1% of fentanyl was seized at the Northern border with Canada, CBP found.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sharply criticized the tariffs, calling them a \"dumb\" policy that does not \"make sense.\"",

      "Sheinbaum rebuked remarks made by Trump on Monday alleging that \"vast amounts of fentanyl\" have entered the U.S. from Mexico. Sheinbaum cited CBP data showing that seizures of fentanyl from Mexico declined 50% between October 2024 and January 2025.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We have said it in different ways: cooperation and coordination, yes; subordination and interventionism, no.\"",

      "\"Can you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time?\" Musk said on Inauguration Day.",
      "It will take a herculean effort from NASA to make a mission to Mars a reality, experts told ABC News. It must build on the Artemis program -- which Trump established in 2017 to build a human presence on the moon -- to get people setting foot on Mars, according to NASA.",
      "\"NASA\u2019s current moon to Mars exploration approach calls for using missions on and around the moon under the Artemis campaign to prepare for future human missions to Mars,\" an agency spokesperson said in a statement sent to ABC News. \"We\u2019re looking forward to hearing more about the Trump administration's plans for our agency and expanding exploration for the benefit of all, including sending American astronauts on the first human mission to the Red Planet.\"",
      "However, the mission can't simply launch whenever the crews and technology are ready. Scott Hubbard ran the agency's Mars program from 2000 to 2001, served as director of its Ames Research Center for 4 years and was in executive management at NASA for 20 years.",
      "He noted that there are specific windows for when to launch the mission. When Earth and Mars align in their orbits around the sun, the distance and energy required for a spacecraft to travel to Mars are minimized.",
      "The next window is just a year and a half away.",
      "\"Even with the most powerful rockets we have, there is a window of 20 days every 26 months,\" he told ABC News. \"And that's it. I mean, it's literally be there or forget about it.\"",
      "Whenever the mission takes off, it will be an incredibly challenging endurance test filled with problems never encountered before, requiring a crew of astronauts daring enough to make the journey.",
      "Astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams have been getting a taste of that. The pair have been in space for nine months, with their planned 8-day trip to the International Space Station (ISS) getting an unexpected extension for safety reasons.",
      "\"So once we transitioned from not returning on our spacecraft, we transitioned into being a crew member, on the international crew, members on the International Space Station,\" Wilmore told ABC News. \"And that's what we've been doing since we've been here.\"",

      "The ISS crew is researching some of the logistical challenges that the long journey to Mars would present.",
      "\"How do we sustain ourselves? We can't pack all the resources we need on a trip to Mars and sustain a long mission,\" Hague said. \"So we're going to have to figure out how to grow the food that we're going to need.\"",
      "The astronauts would also need to be able to replace equipment that breaks during the trip.",
      "\"So you cannot take every single spare part with you,\" Wilmore said. \"You're going to have to have some way of additive manufacturing -- 3D printing.\"",
      "The trip would also expose astronauts to conditions that could lead to multiple health problems, including the potential risk of cancer and mental health issues, along with bone and muscle problems, space physiologist Rihana Bokhari told ABC News. Getting messages back to Earth could take a while as well, she noted.",
      "\"That communication delay is going to be quite large when it comes to Mars, about 20 minutes each way at the furthest,\" she said.",
      "Setting foot on the fourth planet from the sun may be the goal, but it's only half the battle. A round-trip mission would take at least three years.",
      "\"In addition to transportation, you need a habitat. We have not yet built a place for astronauts to live for the 6 or 7 months it would take to get there and have a really reliable life support,\" Hubbard, the former NASA Mars lead, told ABC News.",
      "Hubbard believes NASA should be thinking longer term for its first manned mission to Mars.",

      "Considering the length of time for the window from now, Hubbard noted that the Apollo missions followed a similar timeline -- from the first tests in 1961 to Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969.",
      "\"And it's going to take not just technological advancement but political will,\" he said. \"It's going to take people to see that this is part of what we do as human beings.\"",

    "summary": "AG Pam Bondi's decision to trumpet the release of Jeffrey Epstein files that contained little new information has ruffled feathers in the White House, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The release, which was trumpeted by the AG, revealed almost no new information.",
      "When more than a dozen MAGA-aligned activists and social media influencers gathered at the White House last week, they had no idea they were about to be handed binders titled \"Epstein Files: Phase 1\"-- and neither did senior White House officials who organized the event, according to multiple sources familiar with the event.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and her team did not inform White House officials in advance that she planned to distribute the binders, which contained almost no new information regarding convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein -- and now the move has ruffled feathers among those closest to President Donald Trump, including his senior White House staff, sources tell ABC News.",
      "The move faced widespread criticism, not only from Democrats but also from some of the president's most loyal supporters.",
      "White House staff moved quickly to try and contain the fallout, privately reaching out to influencers who were critical of Bondi and the move online, according to sources.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, responding to a request for comment from ABC News, said, \"Everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump. Any notion to the contrary is completely false.\"",
      "Officials with the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while facing federal child sex trafficking charges. The well-connected financier, who owned a private island estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands, has long been rumored to have kept a \"client list\" of celebrities and politicians, which right-wing influencers have accused authorities of hiding. Multiple sources familiar with both civil and criminal cases against Epstein say no such list has been discovered.",
      "The night before last week's event, Bondi told Fox News that the Justice Department planned to publish \"a lot of flight logs\" and \"a lot of names\" related to Epstein. However, the binders largely consisted of information previously made public through criminal or civil litigation surrounding Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, leading senior White House staffers to question why Bondi was even teasing the release of new information in the first place.",
      "Ahead of the Justice Department's public release, Bondi directed her staff to compile binders of the materials to distribute to the influencers at the event, sources said. She also instructed her team not to inform White House officials of the plan, according to multiple sources, apparently thinking the surprise would be well received inside the West Wing.",
      "The White House had organized the event a week earlier to engage influential pro-Trump voices who the president credits with aiding his 2024 campaign. According to multiple sources, the agenda never included distributing Epstein-related materials.",
      "During the gathering in the Roosevelt Room, influencers including Liz Wheeler, Rogan O'Handley and Chaya Raichik, the creator of Libs of TikTok, met with Leavitt and Vice President JD Vance. Then, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel entered the room and handed out binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" with the words \"By Order of Attorney General Pam Bondi & FBI Director Kash Patel\" printed on the cover and the word \"Declassified\" stamped across the top -- though the documents did not contain any official government declassification markings.",
      "The information had not yet been posted on the Justice Department website when press cameras, set up to cover British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit, captured influencers leaving the West Wing. Some were seen smiling while holding MAGA hats and the binders -- giving the impression they contained new revelations about one of the most infamous sex trafficking criminals in modern history.",
      "The images quickly went viral, generating a mix of speculation, confusion and outrage across the political spectrum.",
      "\"If you look at the traffic online over the Epstein release, I have never seen the Left and the Right come together in a moment on a debacle,\" Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said on CNN.",
      "Behind the scenes, Trump White House officials pointed the finger at Bondi, who they say quietly arranged the release without notifying senior staff, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, who leads a congressional task force overseeing the release of Epstein-related documents, condemned the move on X, calling it a \"complete disappointment\" and saying she had not been informed of the plan.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and one of Trump's most vocal supporters, also blasted the handling of the release, writing on X: \"The Epstein files were released in an unprofessional manner with paid, partisan social media influencers to curate their binders for us. I can't trust anything in the binder. Neither should you.\"",
      "Bondi proceeded to react to the fallout by accusing the FBI's New York office of withholding information about the Epstein investigation, but did not specify what material she believed the office to be withholding. She demanded that the office \"hand over all records in its possession relating to Epstein\" by 8 a.m. last Friday.",
      "The Epstein material released last week contained previously published pilots' logs and included redactions performed by prosecutors on the case to protect the identities of potential victims, as well as Epstein's so-called \"black book\" that has previously been made public.",
      "One document never before seen is what the Justice Department is calling \"Evidence List,\" a three-page catalog of material apparently obtained through searches of Epstein's properties in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Bondi claimed in an interview Monday night with Fox's Sean Hannity that she has since received \"thousands of pages of documents\" that she has the FBI sifting through, but did not detail what exactly had been turned over.",
      "On Monday, James Dennehy, the head of the FBI in New York and a well-regarded leader in the New York law enforcement community, told the office he was forced to submit his resignation on Friday as assistant director-in-charge of one of the FBI's most visible posts. Dennehy said he was not given a reason for the decision.",

      "As a first-generation Italian American, Gabriel D'Alatri said he felt it was his duty to serve the country that had provided refuge and safety to his family.",
      "At 20 years old, he joined the Marines, where he said he was injured and consequently disabled in service. After serving three years, he went to college and decided to get a federal job to continue showing his commitment to the United States.",
      "On Feb. 26, 2024, he began a job as a product manager for the IRS in Hartford, Connecticut, thinking this was the first step in a decadeslong career in the federal government. However, on Feb. 20, just five days away from his probation period ending and with a 6-month-old baby to take care of, he said he was unexpectedly fired.",
      "Over the past month, the Trump administration, through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, has fired thousands of federal workers nationwide in the past month, in an effort, it claimed, to cut down on government waste. Among those who have lost their jobs are veterans, who make up about 28% of the federal worker labor force as of September 2024, according to federal data. As of Feb. 25, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee said at least 6,000 veterans had been fired across the federal government.",
      "A spokesperson from the Office of Personnel Management, which has spearheaded the \"reduction in force\" effort across the government, said the \"OPM recognizes the dedication and service of all federal employees, including our veteran workforce, and remains committed to supporting them during this transition.\"",
      "\"While workforce restructuring can be a difficult process, we are working to ensure affected employees have access to available resources and opportunities,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last Thursday, President Donald Trump told reporters he is aware and keeping track of the veterans fired as a result of the DOGE cuts.",
      "\"We take good care of our veterans, so we're watching that very carefully,\" Trump said. \"We hope it's going to be a smaller number, but we are having great success in slimming down our government.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told ABC News, \"President Trump has consistently stood up for our brave men and women in uniform -- delivering crucial reforms that improved VA healthcare, decreased veteran homelessness and enhanced education benefits. His efforts to cut wasteful spending and make agencies more efficient will ensure our government can better serve all American families, especially our veterans.\"",
      "On Monday, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., sent letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requesting prioritization of veteran employment during workforce reduction.",
      "\"Many of these veterans already experience the daily challenges of transitioning to civilian life, and facing such layoffs only add to their undue burden,\" wrote Kiggans, whose district includes 196,000 veterans and 180,000 active-duty military and DOD employees.",
      "\u201cAs a former Navy helicopter pilot and a commonsense conservative, I believe we can responsibly rein in government waste while ensuring DoD personnel with prior military service remain in positions where they can continue to contribute to our national security,\" Kiggans told ABC News on Monday. \"We cannot allow much-needed reforms to the size and scope of the federal government to weaken our defense capabilities, especially as we face increasing threats around the globe from adversaries like China and Russia.\u201d",
      "An extension to their service",
      "Veterans often pursue government work after their time in the armed forces, with many seeing it as an extension to their service. Will Attig, executive director of the Union Veterans Council, said he often encourages and puts veterans on a pathway to careers in the federal workforce.",
      "\"It's disappointing to me that all the work we did to improve veterans' lives is being thrown down the drain,\" he said. \"As a veteran advocate who's fought for and worked to make sure I can go to a veteran in need and say, 'Here is a job for you, so you can live the American dream you fought for,' and then come to find out everything I told them was a lie -- I feel like I betrayed myself.\"",
      "D'Alatri said he was advancing greatly in the company and that he had a glowing midyear performance review. He said he was in the middle of the workday when his manager called him to tell him his name was on a list of people to be fired as a result of the federal cuts. In about an hour, following his manager's instructions, he reported to the office, turned in his equipment and was escorted out of his office building.",
      "D'Alatri said he believes he had gone above and beyond in his role. When he was given three months of parental leave when his baby was born, he said he only took one month out of concern he'd fall behind. He noted that his job loss has forced his wife to end maternity leave early and return to full-time work.",
      "\"I worked tirelessly for the past year. I never called out once. This just comes as a shock to me because the feedback I was getting from the people I worked for was great,\" he said. \"A few years back, I proved my loyalty. I love this country -- we are the backbone of this country. It's really hurtful and it's sad because I love this country so much.\"",
      "Attig said he believes the government has much to lose by firing veterans in the federal workforce.",
      "\"They lose someone who is dedicated to this country, someone who at a very young age, they raised their right hand to say, I am going to give my life for this country. When they entered the civil service after their military service, they raised their same right hand and said they're going to pledge to uphold the Constitution,\" he said.",
      "\"Most importantly, you take away someone who truly cares about their country, someone who is using their federal work as a second service,\" he added.",
      "Lyndsay Butts is a disabled veteran who served in the Air Force and was an executive assistant at the U.S. Forest Service in Cedar City, Utah. She, too, was terminated when her probation period was nearing completion -- it was set to end on March 9.",
      "'It feels like a slap in the face'",
      "\"Those of us that are veterans wrote a blank check for our lives and said, 'Use me how you can to support this country.' It feels like a slap in the face to not even have the opportunity to defend my job. It feels like a slap in the face that my brothers and sisters in arms have been treated the same way,\" she said.",
      "\"I sacrificed a part of my life and I have lasting baggage from that experience, and you're just going to get rid of me?\" she added. \"Throw me away like a piece of garbage? It hurts.\"",
      "Butts said she worries the firings in her agency will cause a huge lack of services to forests and the people who enjoy them. Everything from toilets to trails won't be adequately cleaned and maintained, firewood permits won't be sold and campgrounds may not open, she said.",
      "\"They didn't bring anyone down to ask us, 'What do you need? What don't you need?' They have no idea how we operate,\" she said. \"I just want my job back. I want my job back because my job is needed. I know my job is important.\"",
      "Bill to reinstate veterans unlikely to pass",
      "To combat the uncertainty these firings have caused veterans across the country, Rep. Derek Tran, D-Calif., an Army veteran, introduced a bill to reinstate veterans fired from the federal government under Trump. The bill, titled the Protect Veteran Jobs Act, would also require federal agencies to submit reports to Congress on the veteran dismissals and provide clear justifications for termination. D'Alatri sought help from Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., who is a co-sponsor of this bill, and he will be Courtney's special guest at Trump's joint address to Congress Tuesday night, Courtney announced.",
      "However, the bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-led House.",
      "\"I've spoken to some Republicans on the other side of the aisle. They've shared they think it's a great bill but this is not the right time for them to jump into something like this,\" Tran told ABC News. \"Probably because of what's going on with the administration or fear of retaliation on their part, but that's me speculating.\"",
      "He said he believes the best way people can help veterans is by supporting the bill.",
      "\"Veterans bring incredible value and expertise to our federal government and provide essential services to American families and service members,\" Tran said. \"It is critical we protect the livelihoods of veterans who have served our country honorably and who continue to do so through civilian service. Our veterans have always had our backs, and now it's time we step up to have theirs.\"",
      "On Thursday, Feb. 27, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a combat veteran who serves on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, held a town hall for veterans concerned about federal terminations.",
      "\"Let's call Trump and Musk's DOGE cuts what they are: They're a middle finger to our veterans, and they're a slap in the face to the sacrifices they've made,\" Duckworth said. \"Trump and unelected billionaire Elon Musk may not know the first thing about sacrifice and service, but our veterans sure as hell do. We will not be quiet, and I will never stop working to honor the commitment we've made to our nation's heroes.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Duckworth said the Department of Veterans Affairs was working to rehire several employees who worked on the Veterans Crisis Line after she raised concerns alongside Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "\"Now, after I raised these cases to the VA and spoke out about them, it sounds like, thankfully, at least some of these employees will be rehired,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas. As tariffs on Mexico go into effect, they are among the first to shoulder the burden..",
    "story": [
      "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas.",
      "Emily Williams Knight, president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association, represents 58,000 restaurants that employ 1.5 million Texans. That breaks down to 11% of the state's workforce that could potentially be impacted by the 25% tariffs on Mexican imports that just went into effect.",
      "All Tuesday morning she was on calls and in meetings, calming fears because people believe Texas will feel the brunt of this first -- And, after that, the domino effect will be fast.",
      "\"Exhausted and afraid: Those are the words I keep hearing from people,\" Williams Knight said. \"They're running out of levers to pull here, and they're afraid. If this is a sustained tariff policy -- what that will mean to their business long term? The unpredictability comes with a tremendous cost.\"",
      "One of those concerned businesses is Texas Cafe in Rio Grande City, which has been serving South Texas for more than 85 years and was recently certified as a historical landmark by the State of Texas. People travel from all over the country to try their signature dish, Envueltos: A special chile-con-carne filling rolled up in a tortilla. But don't call it an enchilada or the owner, Becky Garza, will scold you profusely.",
      "\"These are my grandfather's recipes that he invented back in 1939,\" she said. \"And when you change something, people notice. Especially Hispanic people.\"",
      "Garza is getting ready for Cuaresma, or 40 days of Lent. It is essential that she gets very specific ingredients from Mexico for this time of year or her customers will know something isn't right. Plain and simple: Her business, livelihood and family legacy depend on imports from Mexico that play an essential role in the food she serves. And now, she said, all of that is going to cost more because of the new tariffs.",
      "\"I can buy stuff from Mexico cheap and use it in my home. But I can't use any of those products from Mexico in my business unless I buy them from a store that follows FDA guidelines. I buy Mexican cokes. I get cinnamon sticks. These are a very high-price now and sometimes hard to find. I get pilonsios. Chile guajillo for menudo. And avocados from Mexico are better -- the real avocados from Mexico that you can only find in small stores. But boy, they are expensive, and it's only going to get worse,\" Garza explained, adding: \"I will not stop getting these items from Mexico, because I don't want to change the consistency or the quality.\"",
      "Garza has seen prices steadily increasing over the last few years. In 2024, she spent around $1,000 for her specialty Cuaresma items. But in 2025, she spent $1,200 -- a 20% increase that may not seem like a lot to big retail chains, but is huge for small business owners like Garza.",
      "Knight wholeheartedly agrees, saying, \"In the last four years we've seen a 35% increase in the cost of food needed in these restaurants and a 36% increase in labor. That's not even including the big swipe fees businesses are paying, plus the increases to rent and utilities.\"",
      "Over the last 30 days, TRA has worked closely with the National Restaurant Association on a strategy to help mitigate the uncertainty. They've suggested restaurants review their menus and supply chain, looking for ways to source things closer to their businesses. They've also encouraged businesses to keep pushing the value of their service and products. And, before these tariffs went into effect, they reached out to lawmakers to educate them on the impact and push for exemptions.",
      "\"It feels like we are in this very unknown space again,\" Williams Knight said.",
      "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas.",
      "So, while both big and small establishments will be impacted, Williams Knight said she worries that this will create a ripple effect that could drive some families to close up shop.",
      "She said that some of their restaurants are already starting to get emails from suppliers about costs going up, and she compared the feeling to a few days after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown was announced, explaining: \"You're going to see a very large number of closures and then a large number of people unemployed.\"",
      "For years, as prices have gone up, Garza has found a way to cut back and save so she doesn't have to charge customers more. In fact, she's been working a second, primary job that sustains her own day-to-day needs, opting not to take a real paycheck from Texas Cafe. But she\u2019s retiring in June and having to think about her future.And for the first time since she's taken over the restaurant, Garza made the tough decision on Tuesday to raise prices.",
      "\"I had a meeting with my waitress and we're going up on the breakfast menu due to the high price of eggs,\" Garza explained. \"I save money and I am frugal. But right now it's been getting difficult.\"",
      "Not wanting to manifest any other difficulties the restaurant may face in the future, she said that's all she's willing to do and talk about for now.",
      "However, there are indicators that the tariff policies that went into effect Tuesday may not affect small businesses as extremely as some are predicting, or their customers, for too long.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration could announce a pathway for tariff relief on Mexican and Canadian goods covered by the North America Free Trade Agreement as soon as Wednesday, according to an interview with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Fox Business on Tuesday.",

      "There\u2019s no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help, particularly for large-scale deportations, requesting that police and sheriffs alert them to people it wants to deport and hold them until federal officers take custody.",
      "But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims of crime and witnesses who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",

      "The city's Trust Act generally restricts how much the police can cooperate with ICE, although it does allow some cooperation with a division called Homeland Security Investigations when it comes to such issues as combating human trafficking or drug and weapons trafficking.",
      "The city also must follow a 2017 ruling by the state\u2019s highest court that forbids Massachusetts authorities from holding a person otherwise entitled to release from custody based solely on a federal request.",
      "Those requests, called detainers, typically ask federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to give at least 48 hours\u2019 notice before suspected immigrants are released from jail \u2014 or to hold them for up to 48 hours after they would normally be released so ICE can pick them up. Otherwise, ICE must go out into the community to arrest them.",

      "City officials beefed up protections after Trump first took office in 2017 and again in 2020, when it required police to document requests for assistance from federal agents. Illinois also has protections allowing anyone, regardless of immigration status, to get a driver's license.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson, who took office in 2023, inherited a migrant crisis his first year. Short on shelter space, Chicago\u2019s leaders used police station lobbies, airports, parked buses and hotels to house asylum-seekers.",

      "LEXINGTON, Miss. -- Robert G. Clark, who was elected in 1967 as Mississippi's first Black lawmaker of the 20th century and rose to the second-highest leadership role in the state House of Representatives, died Tuesday at age 96, his son said.",
      "Rep. Bryant Clark, who succeeded Robert Clark, said his father died of natural causes at home in Holmes County, north of Jackson.",
      "A teacher and descendant of slaves, Clark was ostracized during his first years at the state Capitol, relegated to sitting solo at a two-person desk in the House chamber and ignored by white colleagues at social events.",
      "By the time he left office 36 years later, he had served as chairman of both the House Ethics Committee and the powerful Education Committee. In a state where nearly 40% of residents are Black, he saw more Black candidates win seats as voting rights were enforced and more majority-Black districts were drawn, sometimes under court order.",
      "Clark also won the respect and support of colleagues, Black and white, who elected him in January 1992 to House speaker pro tempore, a position he retained until he retired in 2004.",
      "Clark was among five activists and elected officials honored in February 2018 during a black-tie-optional gala at the newly opened Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.",
      "The glitzy event was a lifetime away from Clark\u2019s hardscrabble early days, when most of his relatives worked in cotton fields on family land in Holmes County. As a small child, he would sit by the side of the field with his elderly grandfather, William Clark, who was born a slave and shared vivid memories of deprivation.",
      "\u201cHe had never owned a pair of pants or shoes until after slavery,\u201d Robert Clark told The Associated Press in a 2018 interview. \u201cTheir feed was poured over to them in a trough just like we feed hogs, and they had to get down and eat the best way they could.\u201d",
      "That grandfather's wisdom, he said, helped give him the sense of self to become a leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d throw a hand of corn over and the chickens would be eating. I\u2019d throw another hand of corn over there, and chickens would leave that hand of corn and run to another hand,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I asked him, \u2018Grandpa, why them old crazy chickens got corn and just run to the other corn?\u2019 He said, \u2018Young man, they\u2019re just following the crowd.\u2019 And he said, \u2018That\u2019s something I never want you to do.\u2018",
      "\u201cAnd from feeding the chickens, that became a part of me \u2014 not just following the group.\u201d",
      "Clark went to Michigan to earn a master\u2019s degree in education, and then fulfilled a promise he had made to older relatives by returning to the family land in Mississippi. As a teacher and coach, he often went into his athletes\u2019 homes.",
      "\u201cI realized many of the parents could not help their children with the lessons,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I went to the superintendent of education to ask him if he would implement an adult education program. And he told me, \u2018No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of the county to do that.\u2019\u201d",
      "After the all-white local school board denied Clark's request to start the program that would primarily help Black adults, he announced his candidacy for that board. Maneuvering to keep a Black man off the board, the local state representative got a change in state law to make that school board appointed rather than elected. Rather than accept defeat, Clark ran against that representative, and made history by winning.",
      "Because Black people were generally not accepted in the Democratic Party that controlled Mississippi, Clark\u2019s family had belonged to what they called the \u201cBlack and Tan\" segment of the Republican Party when he was a child. With allegiances flipping in the late 1960s, he ran his first legislative race as an independent. Only later would he run, and win, as a Democrat.",
      "On inauguration day in January 1968, Clark didn\u2019t know if he would be allowed to take his oath. The white candidate he defeated had filed a complaint claiming he didn't live in Holmes County, where his family had lived for generations.",
      "Clark arrived at the Capitol with his attorney, Marian Wright, who later founded the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, a national advocacy group for the poor. They were standing near a statue of the late Theodore Bilbo, an arch-segregationist who had served as Mississippi governor and U.S. senator, when they were told about 10 minutes before the ceremony that Clark would be sworn in.",
      "The ornate House chamber, with marble walls and stained-glass windows, was filled with two-person oak desks where seatmates swapped gossip and often became fast friends. In January 1968, in deeply segregated Mississippi, the senior member of Clark\u2019s local legislative delegation decreed that Clark would sit by himself.",
      "The isolation extended to group dinners for legislators: \u201cNobody would sit with me,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Sitting alone at tables set for six or eight created a dilemma, he recalled: \"I very shortly went up to 240 pounds. I didn\u2019t intend to gain weight. I just wasn\u2019t going to leave all that food on the table.\u201d",
      "Clark and his first wife, Essie, had two sons \u2014 Robert G. Clark III and Wandrick Bryant Clark. She died of cancer in 1977, and he raised their sons as a widower, homeschooling them and taking them to the state Capitol while the Legislature was in session.",
      "About 19 years after her death, Clark married Jo Ann Ross. In 2003, he chose not to seek re-election, and the seat was won by his second son. Bryant Clark also continued to practice law. Robert G. Clark III, meanwhile, served as a chancery judge in four counties.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department on Tuesday reinstated the \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d designation for Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi group, fulfilling an order announced by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the department had restored the designation, which carries with it sanctions and penalties for anyone providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d for the group.",
      "\u201cSince 2023, the Houthis have launched hundreds of attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as U.S. service members defending freedom of navigation and our regional partners,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"Most recently, the Houthis spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels in the critical trade corridor with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. In January, the group signaled that it will limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned wider assaults could resume if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s first Republican administration had similarly designated the Houthis in its waning days, but the designation had been revoked by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.",

      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north."

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance says a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russia than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance is making the case that a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russian President Vladimir Putin than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France.",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity aired Monday evening that the pact that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "The comments throw the spotlight again on differences between President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. The European leaders have called for a post-conflict peacekeeping force in Ukraine to prevent Russia invading again if Moscow and Kyiv reach a truce to put a stop to Russia's invasion, launched in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThe president knows that, look, if you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,\u201d Vance added.",
      "The Republican vice president did not mention any particular country in his skeptical comments to Hannity about the effectiveness of a potential peacekeeping mission. But in a posting on X on Tuesday, Vance looked to head off any criticism by noting that Britain and France \u201chave fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond.\u201d",
      "French troops deployed to Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. And British troops have served alongside American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and in a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group.",
      "Vance's comments came in an interview recorded hours before a White House official confirmed on Monday evening that Trump directed a pause of U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia.",
      "Trump remains frustrated with Zelenskyy. He again criticized the Ukrainian leader on Monday after Zelenskyy said that reaching an agreement with Russia to end the conflict likely \u201cis still very, very far away.\u201d",
      "Trump administration and Ukrainian officials, during Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit last week, had been expected to sign off on a deal that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war.",
      "But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after Trump and Vance had a heated exchange with Zelenskyy during Oval Office talks at the start of the visit.",
      "Ukraine is believed to have deposits of strategically important minerals \u2014 including titanium. lithium and manganese \u2014 that could be useful for American aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing.",
      "Trump hasn't given up all hope of reaching an agreement. And the White House has billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.",
      "Trump on Monday called the proposal \u201ca great deal\u201d for the U.S. and Ukraine and signaled that he would speak to it during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.",
      "Starmer says that \"a mineral deal is not enough on its own\u201d to ensure Ukraine's security. The British prime minister has no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in a potential peacekeeping mission.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump last week, and others are trying to make the case to Trump that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case of breaches of a truce."

      "In 2024, he gave a total of $3.7 billion to support arts, education, the environment, public-health groups, and programs aimed at improving city governments. He gives directly to charities and through his Bloomberg Philanthropies, which last year awarded a $1 billion grant to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, to make medical school free and to provide financial aid to nursing and public health students.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never understood people who wait until they die to give away their wealth. Why deny yourself the satisfaction?\u201d he wrote in an email to the Chronicle. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky, and I\u2019m determined to do what I can to open doors for others and to leave a better world for my children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "Bloomberg was one of six donors who gave $1 billion or more in 2024. The others were Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin (No. 2), Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his wife, Susan Dell (No. 3), investor Warren Buffett (No. 4), Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, physician Priscilla Chan (No. 5), and retired professor Ruth Gottesman (No. 6).",
      "The majority of those gifts went to foundations and donor-advised funds that support causes including education, economic mobility, social justice, and scientific research. Gottesman, like Bloomberg, gave to make medical school free. She donated $1 billion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.",
      "Together the 50 donors on the list contributed a total of $16.2 billion to charity in 2024. The median amount they gave was $100 million.",
      "While those numbers are sizable, not all of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people appear on the list. Only 19 of the richest Americans on the Forbes 400 list donated enough to appear in the Philanthropy rankings.",
      "Among those who gave big \u2014 but are less well known:",
      "\u2014 Thomas Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, is No. 8. He gave away $500 million last year. Almost $400 million of that went to 123 nonprofits in New York and Florida with no strings attached. About 90 of those gifts were $1 million to $5 million, often to small groups that rarely get contributions of that size. Many were to organizations that serve people with developmental, intellectual, and physical disabilities. The issue has great meaning to Golisano, whose son has a developmental disability.",
      "\u2014 Retired insurance executive Hyatt Brown and his wife, Cici, at No. 20, gave the Museum of Arts & Sciences, in Daytona Beach, Fla., $150 million for a new building and to turn its current home into a children\u2019s museum.",
      "\u2014 Businesswoman and venture capital investor Michele Kang, at No. 28, gave $84 million last year, including $4 million to help the USA Women\u2019s Rugby Sevens team prepare for the Olympics.",
      "Some big public debates have been swirling in the world of philanthropy. Some donors \u2014 most notably hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman \u2014 pushed back against the institutions they have supported, criticizing universities\u2019 responses to the October 7 attacks in Israel and campus protests against the war in Gaza; critiquing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; demanding changes; and pledging to halt support.",
      "Some philanthropists believe that politicized public debates about giving are unhelpful noise that can get in the way of doing effective work. K. Lisa Yang (No. 34), a retired investment banker, gave $74.5 million this year, much of that to MIT and Cornell University, where she is a trustee.",
      "Over the years, Yang has given large sums to programs that help people who are physically or cognitively disabled, and she advocates for individuals with disabilities and autism-spectrum disorders.",
      "\u201cThe people who are suffering from these disorders, they don\u2019t have the luxury of time,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you have a rare disease and they do politics, to the people who are suffering from the disorder, it is totally irrelevant. They\u2019re still suffering.\u201d",
      "But some donors are loath to get ensnared in high-profile polarizing issues, says Renee Kaplan, CEO of the donor advisory firm Forward Global. As a result, she says, some donors are staying out of the fray by making anonymous gifts. Others are working together in donor collaboratives, both to boost their power and resources and to shield individual contributors from criticism.",
      "Donors are starting to say, \u201cI\u2019ll do more anonymously. I\u2019m not going to put my name on things. I\u2019m going to slow down our foundation for a while because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be a target,\u201d Kaplan says. \u201cI think there\u2019s genuine concern and pause and fear that\u2019s affecting donors.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s list marks the 25th anniversary of the Philanthropy 50 ranking. Buffett was the top donor over that period, with cumulative gifts totaling $49.4 billion. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates followed, with the $34 billion they gave together. (Since their divorce, both have appeared on the list individually.) Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk round out the top five.",
      "Buffett, Gates and French Gates, and Bloomberg together account for roughly one-third of the $314.5 billion in giving by Philanthropy 50 donors since 2000. The biggest gift made during that time is Buffett\u2019s 2006 pledge to the Gates Foundation, valued at the time at $36.1 billion.",

      "It was a punishment for mutiny in colonial times, a way to discourage desertion during the Civil War and a dose of frontier justice in the Old West. In modern times, some consider it a more humane alternative to lethal injection. The firing squad has a long and thorny history in the U.S.",
      "South Carolina on Friday is scheduled to put the first person to death by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years. Brad Sigmon, who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001, chose it over the two other methods in South Carolina \u2014 the electric chair and lethal injection.",
      "Since 1608, at least 144 civilian prisoners have been executed by shooting in America, nearly all in Utah. Only three have occurred since 1977, when the use of capital punishment resumed after a 10-year pause. The first of those, Gary Gilmore, caused a media sensation in part because he waived his appeals and volunteered to be executed. When asked for his last words, Gilmore replied, \u201cLet's do it.\u201d",
      "Five states \u2014 Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah \u2014 authorize the use of firing squads in certain circumstances.",
      "Here's a look at the history behind the death penalty method.",
      "The earliest recorded execution by shooting came in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1608. Capt. George Kendall came to be suspected of mutiny \u2014 and possibly of conspiring with Spain. Centuries later, in 1996, archaeologists discovered a bullet-ridden body buried in the fort's walls that many suspect was Kendall.",
      "In the American Revolution, public executions by firing squad were sometimes used to punish desertion.",
      "In 1776, then-Gen. George Washington spared a Connecticut soldier, Ebenezer Leffingwell, who was sentenced to die after fighting with a superior, the Journal of the American Revolution recounted. Leffingwell had been bound, blindfolded and forced to kneel in front of a crowd when a chaplain involved in the proceedings announced he would live.",
      "Mark Smith, a history professor at the University of South Carolina, said firing squads were used \u2014 not often \u2014 by both sides during the Civil War to create a \u201cpublic spectacle, a vision of terror\u201d to keep soldiers in line.",
      "\u201cA man could be sitting on his own coffin at times or blindfolded, shot by six or seven men, one of whom has a blank,\u201d the professor said. \u201cThese were gatherings designed to shock and it worked.\u201d",
      "At least 185 men were executed by firing squad during the Civil War, according to Christopher Q. Cutler in a Cleveland State Law Review article.",
      "Firing squads were primarily used only in Utah, where the lawmakers in 1851 designated three possible punishments for murder: shooting, hanging or beheading. The first firing squad execution was carried out in a courthouse enclosure, disappointing a crowd waiting outside to see it.",
      "Only one other state since 1900 has executed someone by shooting: Nevada, which in 1913 built a contraption that fired three guns by pulling strings because it had trouble finding volunteers to serve on a firing squad.",
      "An 1877 sentencing in Utah gave rise to the first U.S. Supreme Court case challenging a specific execution method. Wallace Wilkerson, who shot a man to death during a heated game of cribbage, challenged authorities' plans to kill him by firing squad. The court declined his appeal, finding that unlike some other bygone methods \u2014 drawing and quartering, for example \u2014 execution by firing squad would not bring the sort of \u201cterror, pain and disgrace\u201d that would violate the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "As it turned out, Wilkerson's killing was botched, Cutler noted: Reportedly intoxicated and smoking a cigar, he moved slightly just before the executioners shot. Badly wounded, he fell to the ground, saying, \"My God! They\u2019ve missed it.\u201d It took him an agonizing 15 minutes to die.",
      "Among other famous firing squad executions in Utah was the 1915 death of labor activist and songwriter Joe Hill, who until the end insisted on his innocence in the murder of a grocer and his son.",
      "One of the reasons firing squads did not gain much use beyond Utah was that people viewed them as barbaric, according to Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham School of Law.",
      "The bloody reality of those killings, as well as botched hangings and electrocutions, which sometimes led people to struggle and suffer, prompted states in the early 1980s to begin turning to lethal injection, a procedure viewed \u2014 at least initially \u2014 as more humane.",
      "But since then, lethal injection has become the most commonly botched execution method, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. States have struggled to obtain the required drugs, and some have taken another look at firing squads \u2014 an old but largely reliable method. Lawmakers in Idaho are considering a bill that would make firing squads the primary method of execution there.",
      "Two people now on Utah\u2019s death row have requested firing squads.",
      "Denno urged policymakers to reconsider firing squads in a 2016 law review article. Among those who have expressed similar views is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in a 2017 dissent that \u201cin addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.\u201d",
      "\u201cLethal injection has only gotten worse over the decades,\u201d Denno told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cThe firing squad really stands out as a relatively decent method of execution.\u201d",

      "Members of the Northside Skull and Bones Gang woke up the city with drums and chants, spreading a message of peace.",
      "\u201cMardi Gras is all about having these moments. This city is like nowhere else in the country right now,\u201d said Kendall Calyen, 41, marveling at the 200-year-old tradition unfolding before his eyes.",
      "Thousands of revelers sporting beads and outlandish costumes filled the streets as New Orleans prepared to celebrate just ahead of bad weather. Thunderstorms and winds up to 60 mph (100 kph) are expected throughout Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. In neighboring Jefferson Parish, officials canceled parades.",
      "The city\u2019s two biggest parades \u2014 hosted by the social clubs Krewe of Zulu and Krewe of Rex \u2014 moved up their start times, shortened their routes and are going without marching bands, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Monday. The parades were required to wrap up by 11:30 a.m. Tuesday to avoid worsening weather.",
      "All along Jackson Avenue at the start of the Krewe of Zulu parade, family and friends gathered wearing Mardi Gras purple, gold and green. Many reclined in chairs, ready to enjoy the long haul. Impromptu barbecues wafted smoke from street corners and hip hop blared.",
      "Jeremy Speed, a 40-year-old Krewe of Zulu member who grew up watching the parade, rode a float Tuesday and tossed his hand-painted coconuts to onlookers. He was disappointed that the route had been shortened due to weather but was grateful that the parades weren't canceled altogether.",
      "\u201cAt least they let us roll, they figured it out. They gave us a little something,\u201d Speed said. \u201c... Ain\u2019t nothing like Zulu, the people that show up.\u201d",
      "Kirkpatrick warned paradegoers to not bring umbrellas, tents or \u201canything that could fly in the wind and cause mayhem.\u201d Worsening weather could still lead to parades being canceled at the last minute, she added.",
      "\u201cI will cancel the parades at that point, no matter what time that is,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI hold that trump card in which I will not hesitate to cancel \u2014 I won\u2019t do it lightly, but I will do it.\u201d",
      "Two other parades which had been scheduled to roll through the city later on Tuesday with nearly 200 truck floats were postponed to Sunday, Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Other cities along the Gulf Coast, such as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, hold their own Mardi Gras Day parades.",
      "The weeks of carnival culminate with feasting on Fat Tuesday, which precedes Ash Wednesday, the start of Lent. This year's Mardi Gras Day fell unusually late in the year.",
      "But the outsized culture of street parties, extravagant balls and spirited parades has evolved into a decidedly secular spectacle in the Big Easy.",
      "The day kicks off with the North Side Skull and Bone Gang, a drum-playing group which for more than 200 years has gathered before sunrise to awaken neighbors in the Treme neighborhood.",
      "Across the city, renowned Black masking Indians, whose spectacular beaded and bejeweled costumes are topped with feathered headdresses, take to the streets to represent a central part of African American culture in the city dating back to the 1800s.",
      "One of the most beloved parades, the Krewe of Zulu, typically features hundreds of marching members tossing trinkets such as beads and highly coveted decorated coconuts to spectators.",
      "And the Krewe of Rex, a social club led by the honorary king of carnival season, bears the traditional colors of purple, green and gold.",
      "Extra security measures have been taken for this year's festivities, which follow a devastating Jan. 1 truck attack that killed 14 people. The Department of Homeland Security upgraded Mardi Gras to its highest risk rating, leading to an influx of law enforcement agents. A zigzagging layout of barriers parallels the main parade route to guard against fast-moving vehicles and armored trucks; SWAT teams and helicopters will be present."

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "Bryan Kohberger\u2019s defense attorneys and prosecutors have made secrecy the norm rather than an exception, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler wrote in a court order on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis runs counter to the public's First Amendment rights to know what is going on in its courts,\u201d Hippler wrote. He ordered the attorneys to use the least restrictive steps necessary to protect confidential information in the case, such as redacting some lines or using initials instead of an individual's full name.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, students who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near their campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Hippler\u2019s directive came as a flurry of new motions were filed ahead of the August trial, including a sealed defense motion to take the death penalty off the table that cited autism spectrum disorder.",
      "Other sealed motions include one on whether the terms \u201cpsychopath\u201d or \u201csociopath\u201d can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial. Some of the currently sealed documents will be redacted and made public, and others will remain sealed, the judge ruled.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that the head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, saying President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\u201d Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration\u2019s massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \u201cunique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\u201d Dellinger told reporters outside Washington\u2019s federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger\u2019s firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \u201ca constitutional red line\u201d by blocking Dellinger\u2019s firing and stopping Trump \u201cfrom shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.\u201d",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024."

The North Carolina Forest Service was conducting water drops and back-burning operations on the ground, and area residents should expect a lot of smoke during those operations, officials said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade.",
      "But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. Inflation stayed under control. The economy kept growing as it had before. And America\u2019s massive trade deficits, the main target of Trump\u2019s ire, proved resistant to his rhetoric and his tariffs: Already big, they got bigger.",
      "The trade war sequel that Trump has introduced in his second term is likely to be a different matter altogether. Trump appears to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment this time.",
      "His plans to plaster tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and to double a 10% levy on China Tuesday \u2013 and to follow those up by targeting other countries \u2013 would threaten growth, and push up prices in the United States, undermining his campaign pledge to eliminate the inflation that plagued President Joe Biden.",
      "The tariffs would be paid by U.S. importers, who would then try to pass along the higher costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Trump himself has warned of possible fallout. \u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\u201d Trump said in a social media post last month. \u201cBUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d",
      "For a while, most of the hostilities were on hold. Trump, who had said he would hit Canada and Mexico on Feb. 4, delayed imposing the tariffs for 30 days. Now they're scheduled to start Tuesday. He went ahead with 10% import taxes on Chinese goods \u2014 and Beijing promptly retaliated by hitting U.S. coal, big cars and other items \u2014 and plans to double them Tuesday.",
      "Trump views tariffs \u2013 taxes on imports \u2013 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\u201cThat was then. This is now,\u2019\u2019 said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \u201cthat would show up on Walmart\u2019s shelves,\u201d said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, by contrast, the tariffs are across the board \u2013 although the tariffs Trump plans Tuesday would limit hte levy on Canadian energy to 10%, showing that he was mindful of how much Americans in northern and midwestern states depend on oil and electricity from north of the border.",
      "In Boca Raton, Florida, the toy company Basic Fun is preparing to raise prices and absorb a hit to profits when the tariffs land.",
      "Ninety percent of Basic Fun\u2019s toys come from China, including Tonka and Care Bears. CEO Jay Foreman says the price on the Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck is likely to rise later this year from $29.99 to as much as $39.99.",
      "Five years ago, the Trump administration spared toys, exempting them from its China tariffs. This time, Foreman said, \"we are now just going to forecast a lot of money draining out of the company.''",
      "Also worrying, economists say, is a retaliation clause the Trump team inserted in the tariff orders he signed last month.",
      "If other countries retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariffs with tariffs of their own \u2013 as China did and Canada and Mexico have threatened -- Trump will lash back with still more tariffs. That risks \u201csetting off a spiraling trade war\u2019\u2019 of tit-for-tat tariffs and counter-tariffs, said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.",
      "Economists gathered Monday at a conference of the National Association for Business Economics were generally wary of the import taxes and their impact on the economy. Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the proposed duties could drag down economic growth by as much as a half-percentage point.",
      "One big difference between Trump\u2019s first term is that he's likely to get less pushback from his own aides. \u201cThis is true religion inside the White House right now, unlike the first term, when many of the president\u2019s advisers were deeply skeptical of this policy,\u201d Strain said.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at the giant accounting firm KPMG, said the impact of tariffs this time would likely be much bigger than in 2018-2019. Among other things, the president is planning to impose what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs'' \u2014 and raise U.S. import taxes to match higher tariffs charged by other countries.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and scope are different,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cThe goals are different. It\u2019s not just one country, we\u2019re talking about multiple countries at the same time. And the rest of the world is ready to retaliate.\u201d",
      "One of those goals that Trump has cited more often than last time is using tariffs to raise revenue for the government, Swonk noted. Trump and some of his officials have talked about substituting tariff revenue for income taxes. If so, that would mean keeping the tariffs in place even if countries like Canada and Mexico agreed to Trump\u2019s demands on other issues, such as immigration restrictions.",
      "Perhaps the biggest difference is the economic backdrop Trump must contend with this time.",
      "Six years ago, inflation was low \u2014 maybe even too low, the Federal Reserve fretted. Trump's first-term tariffs didn't make a dent.",
      "Inflation isn't so benign anymore. Prices surged in the unexpected boom that followed the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. Inflation has come down from the four-decade high it hit in mid-2022, but it's still stuck above the Fed's 2% target and hasn't shown much improvement since summer.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs could rekindle the inflationary trend and convince the Fed to cancel or postpone the two interest rate cuts it had anticipated this year. That would risk keeping \"interest rates at their current elevated level for a longer period in 2025. That will push up mortgage and loan borrowing rates ... and reduce real growth,\u2019\u2019 said Boston College economist Brian Bethune.",
      "Outside a Harris Teeter supermarket near downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, Jacobs Ogadi had in his shopping bag an avocado, which almost certainly came from Mexico.",
      "The 62-year-old mechanic said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist\u2019\u2019 to know that Trump\u2019s tariffs run counter to his promises to rein in inflation. \u201cIf it goes up 25%, it\u2019s not the government, it\u2019s not the Mexican people paying for it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWho pays for it? Us.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Iditarod has begun and promises to be like none before",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The rugged Iditarod started Monday, but a dearth of snow forced the iconic dog sled race to start further north and added a new route that allows mushers to bypass barren land, while lengthening by more than 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) an unforgiving journey often measured in grit and attrition.",
      "The new course reroutes mushers and their dog teams around a difficult stretch of trail north of the Alaska Range, which is treacherous with snow and ice but mostly unpassable in dry conditions for sleds.",
      "The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is usually billed as a 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska. The route change means it's now 1,128 miles (1,815 kilometers). Mushers began their trek to the finish line in Nome from Fairbanks, the fourth time this century the race has been forced north from the Anchorage area.",
      "A lack of snow in the Anchorage area also caused headaches for race organizers Saturday during the ceremonial start. The parade-like route in Anchorage usually has mushers taking a leisurely course over 11 miles (17.70 kilometers) of city streets and trails with an auction winner riding in their sled.",
      "However, weeks of little-to-no new snowfall and warm temperatures in Alaska\u2019s largest city forced organizers to shorten the ceremonial start to less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers), run over snow that was trucked in to cover downtown city streets.",
      "There are 33 mushers in this year\u2019s race, tied with the 2023 race for smallest field ever. Among them are two former champions, Ryan Redington and three-time winner Mitch Seavey.",
      "Mushers and their dog teams will battle the worst of what wild Alaska can throw at them \u2014 from bad trails, mushing on frozen rivers and sea ice and possible encounters with wildlife with the winner expected in the old Gold Rush town of Nome on the Bering Sea coast in about 10 days.",
      "This year the Iditarod will honor another famous mushing event, the 1925 Serum Run, in which sled dog teams saved Nome from a deadly diphtheria outbreak."

      "Opening statements are set to begin in the trial of a man accused of opening fire on a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade and killing seven people in 2022",
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill -- The trial of a suburban Chicago man accused of a mass shooting at a 2022 Independence Day parade that killed seven people and wounded dozens more is set to begin Monday.",
      "Robert Crimo III faces 21 counts of first-degree murder, three counts for each person killed, as well as 48 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors dropped the less serious 48 counts of aggravated battery before jury selection last week.",
      "The road to the trial has been bumpy, with delays partly due to Crimo\u2019s unpredictability, including his rejection of a plea deal that even surprised his attorneys. As potential jurors were questioned last week, he sporadically appeared in court, at times refusing to leave his jail cell.",
      "Authorities alleged Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago.",
      "Prosecutors have submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old has since pleaded not guilty.",
      "His defense attorneys have declined comment ahead of the trial, which is expected to last about a month.",
      "His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail.",
      "He has attended his son\u2019s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial.",
      "\u201cAs a parent, I love my son very much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors plan to call multiple law enforcement officers and survivors of the shooting to testify. They also will show videos of Crimo\u2019s statements to police. Some of the videos already have been shown in court as prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to have them thrown out.",
      "Crimo\u2019s erratic behavior has contributed to court delays.",
      "He fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he arrived at the court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal.",
      "Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case.",
      "City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting for a \u201ccommunity walk.\u201d The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and with a memorial for the victims.",
      "\u201cOur community is once again reminded of the immense pain and trauma caused by the Highland Park shooting,\u201d Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said in a statement ahead of jury selection. \u201cOur hearts remain with the victims, their families, and all those whose lives were forever changed by that devastating day.\u201d",
      "The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence."

      "PIEDMONT, Calif. -- Drug use and excessive speed were to blame for last year's fiery crash of a Tesla Cybertruck that killed three college students near San Francisco, the California Highway Patrol said in a preliminary report.",
      "Four people were in the Cybertruck when it veered off a road, slammed into a retaining wall and burst into flames shortly after 3 a.m. on Nov. 27 in Piedmont.",
      "\u201cOfficers determined that a combination of driving under the influence of drugs and unsafe speed were the causes\u201d of the crash, the highway patrol said in a statement last week.",
      "Although police officers who responded were unable to douse the flames with their fire extinguishers, the fire department put the blaze out quickly, officials said at the time.",
      "Piedmont Fire Chief Dave Brannigan said the day after the crash that the speed in extinguishing the flames meant it was unlikely that the Cybertruck\u2019s large lithium-ion battery had caught fire. He called the incident \u201cmore along the lines of a typical car fire.\u201d",
      "Killed in the single-vehicle crash were Soren Dixon, 19, Jack Nelson, 20, and Krysta Tsukahara, 19. The fourth occupant, Jordan Miller, 20, survived after someone in another car managed to pull him out of the wreckage. All four were home from college for Thanksgiving break and graduates of Piedmont High School, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday.",
      "The Chronicle cited toxicology reports that determined the three victims who died had alcohol, cocaine and other substances in their system. Their deaths were ruled an accident because they were caused by asphyxia due to inhalation of smoke from the car, and burns were a \u201csignificant\u201d factor in their deaths, the autopsy report said.",
      "The highway patrol's investigation is ongoing and a final reported is expected within months, the agency said.",
      "The Cybertruck, which has been available for purchase for more than a year, has been recalled multiple times for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix gas pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim."

      "ADRIAN, Mich. -- A Michigan woman is asking a judge to declare her three missing sons dead, nearly 15 years after their father didn't return them after Thanksgiving. The disappearance has tormented a small town near Ohio and remains unsolved.",
      "Authorities believe the brothers are deceased and they clearly suspect John Skelton is responsible, though he has not been charged with killing his sons. By November, he is expected to complete a 15-year prison sentence for his failure to give the boys back to Tanya Zuvers, the sole conviction in the saga.",
      "A Lenawee County judge will begin hearing testimony Monday at an unusual hearing. The witness list includes Zuvers, as well as police investigators who will publicly discuss the yearslong effort to find any trace of Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton.",
      "Since November 2010, Zuvers has prayed someone \"would cure her broken heart\" with news about their whereabouts or that John Skelton would explain what really happened, attorney R. Burke Castleberry said in a court filing.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, none of that has occurred,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Nathan Piwowarski, a lawyer in Cadillac, Michigan, who specializes in probate and estate law, said there can be many reasons to have someone declared dead, including \"personal closure for the family.\"",
      "A court declaration also could \u201cgive someone authority to pursue a wrongful death claim or other civil claim,\u201d said Piwowarski, who is not involved in the case.",
      "Castleberry declined to comment ahead of the hearing. Skelton, 53, did not respond to an email sent to him in prison about the petition filed by Zuvers.",
      "The brothers, ages 9, 7 and 5, lived in Morenci, a small community next to the Ohio border, 100 miles (161 kilometers) southwest of Detroit. Zuvers was seeking a divorce from Skelton in fall 2010 and the boys were with him, a few doors away, on Thanksgiving.",
      "They were supposed to return to Zuvers the next morning. Instead, they were gone. Police later determined Skelton's phone was in Ohio at 4:30 a.m. before it was turned off and then turned back on at 6 a.m. in Morenci.",
      "Skelton denied harming his sons and said they were with an underground group for their safety, among other murky explanations, according to investigators.",
      "People spent weeks searching woods and waters in Michigan and Ohio. While in prison, Skelton told authorities that a man who helps people leave Amish communities might know about the boys, but Castleberry said it was \u201canother lie.\u201d",
      "Investigators at the court hearing \u201cwill detail the farfetched, unfathomable yarns John Skelton spun, leading authorities on one wild goose chase after another,\u201d Castleberry said.",
      "Years have passed, but people in Morenci have not forgotten the Skelton brothers. A plaque with their names and images is attached to a rock at a park near Bean Creek. It says, \u201cFaith, Hope, Love.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out.",
      "Sources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had \u00a39.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK.",
      "The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money.",
      "The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending.",
      "Such rules are put in place by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.",
      "Insiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty for hiking up government borrowing costs.",
      "'Huge rise in welfare spending'",
      "Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training.",
      "\"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added.",
      "Mahmood declined to comment on whether the justice department would face cuts, saying she was \"not going to get ahead\" of Treasury announcements.",
      "Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic.",
      "That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives in the system.",
      "People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\".",
      "But Fire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\".",

      "This week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Trump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves told the BBC on Tuesday that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation.",
      "Meanwhile, uncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid.",
      "One government insider told the BBC: \"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes.",
      "\"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\"",
      "It is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast.",
      "But there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy.",
      "Some firms have warned the higher tax will likely be passed on through increased prices for customers.",
      "Inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, is expect to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills, among others.",

      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",

      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",

      "In February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "In the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.",
      "The moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.",
      "\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.",
      "His business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners.",
      "He presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement.",
      "He will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year.",
      "\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"",

      "During Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.",
      "At the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.",
      "But Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.",
      "His actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US.",
      "And they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year.",
      "But with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.",
      "The average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.",
      "\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.",
      "With manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.",
      "He said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.",
      "\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"",
      "Trump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas.",
      "But toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.",
      "Meanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis.",
      "Basic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment.",
      "\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.",
      "The Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.",
      "President Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way.",
      "\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said.",
      "The Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.",
      "\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.",
      "From their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief.",
      "\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\""

    "summary": "Those currently earning less than \u00a3123 a week are currently not eligible for sick pay.",
    "story": [
      "More than one million low-paid workers in the UK are to be entitled to 80% of their weekly salary as sick pay from the first day of illness, under government plans.",
      "Currently, to qualify for statutory sick pay, you must have been ill for more than three days in a row and earn an average of at least \u00a3123 a week.",
      "\"No one should ever have to choose between their health and earning a living, which is why we are making this landmark change,\" said Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce called the 80% rate a \"fair compromise\", but warned allowing sick pay from day one could lead to higher staff absenteeism that smaller firms could struggle to cope with.",
      "\"Employers often struggle to find shift cover at short notice, leading to disruption for customers,\" said Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the BCC.",
      "\"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\"",
      "The government says the changes will mean about 1.3 million people on low wages who fall ill will receive either 80% of their average weekly earnings or statutory sick pay - which is currently \u00a3116.75 per week \u2013 whichever is lowest.",
      "\"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change,\" Kendall said.",
      "However, some groups are asking the government to set sick pay for the lowest paid workers at no less than 95% of their weekly pay.",
      "TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"This shouldn't be the end of the story.",
      "\"We urge ministers in future to raise the replacement rate for the lowest earners beyond 80% and undertake a wider review of the statutory sick pay rate.\"",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "More workers to get sick pay and parental leave rights",
      "The change to sick pay is part of a number of updates to the Employment Rights Bill expected to be announced on Tuesday, and aims to keep more people off benefits and boost living standards.",
      "The bill, which was published last year, set out plans to improve sick pay and allow workers greater rights to ask for flexible working and unpaid parental leave.",
      "However, the planned increase in workers' rights, together with the rising minimum wage and hike in employers' National Insurance, has led to criticism from many businesses, who say the combined impact will hit growth and employment.",
      "At the weekend it emerged that the government would not be including the \"right to switch off\" for workers in the bill.",
      "This measure had been proposed to stop employers contacting staff out-of-hours on phones, emails and texts.",
      "A government source told the Sunday Times that: \"The right to switch off is dead. We have to lower business compliance costs as much as possible.\""

      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

      "The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code.",
      "The code is set to design principles for online platforms aimed at protecting children in the UK.  Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.",

      "\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC.",
      "\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites.",
      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",
      "Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.",
      "Next steps",
      "The investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law.",
      "But companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.",
      "\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.",
      "It is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:11:21 GMT",
    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:06:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",

      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",

      "A council should pay \u00a36,500 in compensation to an autistic child and their mother for failing to provide special educational provision (SEP), an ombudsman has found.",
      "The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman said Slough Borough Council was at fault in the case of the child, known as Child Y, and the mother, Ms X, and should apologise.",
      "The ombudsman also said the authority's complaint handling caused \"avoidable distress and time and trouble\".",
      "The council apologised and said it sincerely regretted its \"shortcomings\".",
      "The ombudsman said it had failed to provide Y's education, health and care plan between September 2023 and July 2024.",
      "The child was home schooled by the mother from June 2022 to September 2023, but was then due to transfer to a secondary school as part of a council education, health and care (EHC) plan.",
      "But the mother told the council's SEND (special educational needs and disabilities) team that the school could not meet Y's needs.",
      "The council said the situation would be reviewed in October and that Ms X's preferred school had no available places, but in the end she did not send her child to the recommended school.",
      "Months of complaints from Ms X and correspondence between the relevant institutions continued until the following Summer.",
      "The ombudsman found that the council failed to secure the education as part of its care plan and caused Ms X \"confusion and frustration\" because of its \"poor complaint response\".",
      "The report said the authority should \"remedy the injustice\" with a payment of \u00a36,000 to reflect Y's lost SEP, and one of \u00a3500 to Ms X to reflect her \"avoidable distress and time and trouble complaining\".",
      "In a statement a council spokeswoman said: \"While alternative tuition was provided, we accept it did not fully meet the requirements of Y's EHC plan.",
      "\"We are pleased to note that Y has been attending special school placement since September 2024.\"",
      "She said a \"great deal of improvements and development\" had taken place in the last 18 months, and since the failings in this case the council had taken \"corrective action\", and made more approved tuition providers available \"to ensure timely delivery of support\".",
      "It had also \"improved clarity\" in its complaint processes, and was \"committed to improving services for children with EHC plans\".",

    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of children who are eligible for free school meals, but are not claiming them, should be automatically enrolled instead, MPs say.",
      "The cross-party education committee says the government should change the current rules using a bill which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "The education committee also accused the government of rushing the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill through the House of Commons \"at the expense of time for proper scrutiny\".",
      "A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said the government \"welcomed\" the engagement over the bill and said it would carefully consider the committee's recommendations.",
      "In a new report, the education committee has told the government it should use the bill to remove the requirement to apply for free school meals for eligible children from low-income families.",
      "In England, families are eligible to apply for free school meals if they are on universal credit and have a household income below \u00a37,400 per year, after tax, alongside other benefits.",
      "The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population.",
      "However, an estimated one in 10 eligible children miss out on the meals, according to experts who gave evidence to MPs scrutinising the bill.",
      "Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",
      "It added that low uptake of free school meals contributes to hunger at school for children living with deprivation.",
      "The MPs also accused the government of rushing the bill through the House of Commons \"at the expense of time for proper scrutiny\".",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a \"landmark\" bill to \"seek to keep children safe\".",
      "It includes plans for all children to have a unique identifier number, a bit like a National Insurance number, for safeguarding purposes.",
      "It also includes other wide-ranging proposals, such as universal free breakfast clubs in all primary schools, and changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",
      "The DfE said the \"landmark\" schools bill would break the \"unfair link between background and opportunity\".",
      "\"Despite the challenging inherited fiscal context, we are introducing landmark measures to support family finances, including rolling out free breakfast clubs in every primary school and capping the number of branded uniform items parents have to pay for, as well as prioritising reform across children's social care.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

      "The One Direction singer died last October at the age of 31, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina.",
      "In an emotional interview on ITV's Lorraine, Cassidy said she sometimes finds it \"hard to get out of bed\" and still refers to him in the present tense.",
      "\"It's hard for me to refer to him in the past tense, and when I do refer to him in the past tense it almost stings that little bit more because it just... it's more official,\" she said.",
      "\"I find myself talking about him so much in the present tense, and it's something where I don't even feel the need to correct myself, because that's part of my healing journey that I'm still working on accepting the fact he's not here any more.",
      "\"I never thought I would be talking about him in the past tense, so it's definitely really hard to accept.\"",
      "'Harder days'",
      "Cassidy was speaking as she helped launch the programme's March4March campaign, which encourages viewers to walk outdoors for an extra 10,000 steps per week to help their mental health.",
      "Cassidy told host Lorraine Kelly that Payne \"was so open about his mental health\" and she was supporting the campaign because \"he no longer can help people\".",
      "\"I genuinely believe Liam, in a way, guided me to this campaign and wanted me to be involved in this, and to help other people.\"",
      "She continued: \"It really can make such a difference, I've always enjoyed walking... but now I'm going through this healing journey, sometimes it's hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and something I don't want to do.",
      "\"But I have this responsibility and this obligation that I am almost, in a way... I have no choice. I have to get out of bed for [my dog] Nala, whether it's a five-minute walk or 20-minute walk first thing in the morning.",
      "\"Either way, it just wakes me up and refreshes my mind instead of laying in bed all day just scrolling through social media or old photos. It gets me out of bed and really, really helps my mindset and my mental health.\"",
      "Cassidy also said she has \"harder days, but I'm surrounded by such a great support system that I cannot thank enough\".",
      "'One of a kind'",
      "Cassidy concluded: \"I'll always have so much love for Liam. He was one of a kind.",
      "\"He would light up any room he would walk into, he'd have this sense of humour where he could make anything better, and I feel his presence was just comforting, warming, and that's just something I'll never forget about him ever.\"",
      "Cassidy had been staying with Payne in Argentina but flew back to the US shortly before his death.",
      "Payne previously spoke about his mental health, and struggles with alcoholism at the peak of his success with One Direction.",
      "\"He was open about his mental health, and I think anybody should not be afraid to speak out,\" Cassidy said.",
      "On Saturday night, Payne was honoured for his career at the Brit Awards. One Direction won seven gongs at the Brits in total before his band split up.",
      "The following day, Payne's family said they would \"forever remember the joy that his music brought to the world\" and called for privacy from the \"constant media attention and speculation\" on Payne's death.",

    "story": [
      "US investigators are trying to establish how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, died after the discovery of their bodies at their home in the US state of New Mexico.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February - 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation.",
      "Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting",
      "",
      "How were the deaths discovered?",
      "The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services.",
      "In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.",
      "Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park.",
      "The couple appeared to have been \"dead for quite a while\", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza.",
      "Arakawa's body showed signs of \"decomposition\", and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said.",
      "Hackman's remains \"showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent\" with those on his spouse.",
      "A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa.",
      "What do we know about the cause of death for Hackman and Arakawa?",
      "No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths.",
      "The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and did not rule out foul play.",
      "A carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday.",
      "Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground.",
      "An autopsy and toxicology tests have been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released.",
      "The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.",
      "A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant.",
      "Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body.",
      "The detective suspected that the actor had suffered a sudden fall.",
      "Death of Hackman and wife 'suspicious enough' for investigation, police say",
      "Gene Hackman's daughters and Clint Eastwood lead tributes to star",
      "Gene Hackman: One of Hollywood's greatest 'tough guys'",
      "Why are the deaths considered suspicious?",
      "The circumstances of their death were deemed \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", the search warrant says, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open.",
      "However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside.",
      "\"There was no indication of a struggle,\" said Sheriff Mendoza. \"There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.\"",
      "Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out.",
      "What do we know about the time of their deaths?",
      "Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life.",
      "But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa.",
      "The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, say they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier.",
      "The two said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa.",
      "They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa.",
      "What do we know about the couple's health?",
      "Hackman's daughter Leslie Anne Hackman told the Mail Online that her father had been in \"very good physical condition\" despite his age, and had not undergone \"any major surgeries\" in recent months.",
      "\"He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week,\" she said. \"So he was in good health.\"",
      "The couple, married in 1991, had had a \"wonderful marriage\", she added.",
      "\"I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health.\""

      "Other winners on the night included Kieran Culkin, Adrien Brody and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, while Flow won best animated film and I'm Still Here took home the best international prize.",
      "In her speech, 25-year-old Madison said: \"This is very surreal. I grew up in Los Angeles but Hollywood always felt so far away from me, so to be here standing in this room today is really incredible.\"",
      "She added: \"I want to honour and recognise the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally... the women I've had the privilege of meeting from that community has been one of the highlights of this entire incredible experience.\"",
      "The best director trophy was presented by Quentin Tarantino, who previously cast Madison in a small role in his film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.",
      "Accepting the trophy from Tarantino, Baker told him: \"If you didn't cast Mikey Madison... there'd be no Anora.\"",
      "Baker went on to thank the Academy voters for \"recognising a truly independent film\", and used his best director speech to champion cinemas.",
      "\"Where did we fall in love with movies? At the movie theatres,\" Baker said. \"Watching a film in a theatre with an audience is an experience.",
      "\"And at a time when the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever, it's a communal experience you just don't get at home.",
      "\"Right now the theatre-going experience is under threat, independently owned theatres are struggling, and it's up to us to support them.\"",
      "He concluded: \"This is my battle cry: Film-makers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will. Distributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of my films.\"",
      "Baker is the first person to win four Oscars for a single film. Walt Disney did win four prizes in a single night in 1953, but for four different films.",

      "Brody had not been nominated at the Oscars since 2003, when he became the youngest ever winner of best actor for The Pianist.",
      "\"Acting is a very fragile profession,\" he said. \"It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing I've gained in having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective.",
      "\"And no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you've accomplished, it can all go away. And what makes this night so special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude I have to still do the work that I love.\"",
      "Brody refused to be played off during his five-minute speech, continuing: \"I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and repercussions of war, and systematic oppression, and antisemitism and racism.",
      "\"And I pray for a healthier, happier and more inclusive world. And I believe if the past can teach us anything, it's a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.\"",

      "Salda\u00f1a success",
      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a was named best supporting actress for her performance in Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a drug lord who changes gender.",

      "\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961,\" she added, \"I am a proud child of immigrant parents, and I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last.\"",

      "Culkin concludes clean sweep",
      "Succession star Kieran Culkin was named best supporting actor, a category he has dominated throughout awards season.",
      "The actor won for his performance in A Real Pain, about two cousins who travel across Poland in remembrance of their grandmother.",
      "In his acceptance speech, he said: \"I have no idea how I got here, I've just been acting my whole life, it's just been a part of what I do.\"",
      "He thanked the film's writer and director Jesse Eisenberg, telling him: \"Thank you for this movie, you're a genius. I'd never say that to your face, I'll never say it again, so soak it up.\"",
      "Culkin also paid tribute to his Succession co-star Jeremy Strong, who was nominated in the same category.",
      "Firefighters recognised",
      "The Oscars came two months after wildfires devastated Los Angeles. The ceremony opened with a montage of film clips featuring shots of the city, concluding with the slogan: \"We love LA.\"",

      "Elsewhere, Wicked received best production design and best costume design, with Paul Tazewell becoming the first black man ever to receive the latter.",

      "The film's British screenwriter Peter Straughan paid tribute to the writer of the novel the film is based on, saying: \"Thank you Robert Harris for your beautiful book, we're all standing on your shoulders.\"",
      "Elsewhere at the ceremony, Morgan Freeman paid tribute to his \"dear friend\" Gene Hackman, whose death was announced last week.",
      "\"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer, and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman said.",
      "Other winners included The Substance, for best make-up and hairstyling, and Flow, which won best animated film.",
      "Meanwhile, In The Shadow of the Cypress was named best animated short.",
      "Its Iranian directors Shirin Sohani and Hossein Molayemi accepted the prize just three hours after their plane landed in Los Angeles, following difficulties obtaining a US visa.",
      "I'm Still Here, a film about the true story of a Brazilian woman who investigates the disappearance of her congressman husband, was named best international film.",
      "The best documentary award went to No Other Land, a collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli film-makers about the ongoing conflict in the region.",

      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",
      "That film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.",
      "It's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who plays a New York stripper.",

      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

      "Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day.",
      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",
      "What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry.",
      "\"I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,\" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills.",
      "She makes different types of pasta, crudit\u00e9s, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts.",
      "There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt.",
      "\"Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,\" Meghan explains. \"So I try to under salt.\"",

      "It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design.",
      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

    "story": [
      "\"He loved being an actor, and hated all the stuff that surrounds being an actor.\"",
      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",
      "Showdown with John Travolta",
      "Hackman could be \"a hard actor\" to work with, said Sonnenfeld. \"He suffered no fools.\"",
      "In Get Shorty, Hackman starred alongside Travolta, who plays a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt.",
      "\"Gene was a consummate actor, both technically and artistically. So he came to set every day knowing his lines,\" Sonnenfeld said.",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",

      "\"Gene was really rough on Wes,\" recalled Bill Murray, who co-starred with Hackman in the hit 2001 film, in an interview with the Associated Press.",
      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",
      "Moore, for his part, said he didn't ever feel Hackman was difficult to work with.",
      "\"He was patient and relentlessly, flawlessly professional,\" he said.",
      "\"My memories are of him laughing and smiling, and telling very funny jokes.\"",
      "Moore admitted Hackman might have become irritated with anyone on set who made their role bigger than it was.",
      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",

      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",

    "story": [
      "Gene Hackman, who has died aged 95, started his acting career later in life but became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.",
      "Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Hackman had an illustrious five-decade career as an actor.",
      "He won two Oscars and was nominated for another three, playing violent men, yet was equally at home in comedy.",
      "He was once described as having the face of a truck driver, and was suited to character as well as leading roles. Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "But he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.",
      "Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood.",
      "His parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.",
      "His father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens.",
      "\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.",
      "He went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.",
      "\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"",
      "Hackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.",
      "As a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.",
      "He was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.",
      "\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"",
      "After briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\".",
      "Undeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.",
      "Hackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs.",
      "He would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman.",
      "Recognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.",
      "There was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.",
      "There were parts in light comedies both off and on Broadway, which led first to minor television roles and then to some film work.",
      "His first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty.",
      "Impressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.",
      "Hackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "But then came The French Connection.",
      "It was the part that made him.",
      "He played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway.",
      "It brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.",
      "Gene Hackman never looked back.",
      "Whether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.",
      "One of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II.",
      "Hackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.",
      "The 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.",
      "It was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s.",
      "Director Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".",
      "Another Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett.",
      "The film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.",
      "There was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.",
      "Hackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.",
      "His versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.",
      "But he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "A decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.",
      "After quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.",
      "He co-wrote four books with Daniel Lenihan, Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), Justice for None (2004), Vermillion (2004) and Escape from Andersonville (2008).",
      "He went on to deliver two solo writing efforts, Payback at Morning Peak (2011) and Pursuit (2013).",
      "He spoke about why he had taken to his new job.",
      "\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.",
      "\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs).",
      "\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"",
      "Hackman married Faye Maltese in 1956. The couple had three children but divorced in 1986.",
      "Five years later he married Betsy Arakawa, who ran an upmarket furniture store in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Gene Hackman made more than 80 films, and still managed to become both a proficient golfer and respected painter.",
      "He was also a mean performer on the racetrack, driving Formula Ford cars and taking part in the 1983 Daytona Endurance Race.",
      "Throughout his career, he gave few interviews and eschewed the celebrity lifestyle.",

    "story": [
      "At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found.",
      "The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood.",
      "Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their \"questionable accuracy\" and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results.",
      "Fifty and older",
      "There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.",
      "Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, or from 45 for higher risk groups.",
      "That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen.",
      "A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease.",
      "PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer.",
      "Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024.",
      "Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels.",
      "They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from \u00a36 to \u00a395.",
      "They come in two main types:",

      "rapid tests which give a result in minutes and display a dark line if PSA is detected above a certain level",
      "The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day.",
      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, at-home tests are often marketed as a way to \"screen\" for the disease or \"assess prostate cancer risk\", language the regulator says would be allowed under the current rules.",
      "One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked \"for professional use only\".",
      "Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy",
      "For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.",
      "A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette.",
      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.",
      "The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet journal, covering more than 200 countries.",
      "Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.",
      "However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\".",
      "By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.",
      "The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.",
      "If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.",
      "In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.",
      "However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.",
      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",
      "However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.",

      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",

      "Last week both individuals asked to become \"core participants\" in the inquiry - a legal status which also gives the right to make statements and apply to ask questions of witnesses.",
      "PPE Medpro, led by Mr Barrowman, was awarded government contracts worth more than \u00a3200m during Covid after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers.",
      "The inquiry has already ruled that evidence about the company will be heard in private later this month to avoid prejudicing an ongoing National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation. Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing.",
      "To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the NCA has not instructed the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "The Covid inquiry has now opened four weeks of public hearings into the supply and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE and other medical equipment in the pandemic.",
      "On February 27, Baroness Mone, Mr Barrowman and PPE Medpro wrote to the inquiry saying they had a significant role in proceedings and they \"may be subject to explicit and significant criticism\".",
      "They also argued they had concerns about the conduct of the NCA, which has been investigating PPE Medpro since May 2021.",
      "As core participants they would have been granted access to documents and other witness evidence provided to the Covid inquiry. Participants must sign a confidentiality agreement and use that information only for inquiry purposes.",

      "PPE Medpro was one of dozens of companies which won government contracts after being referred through the \"VIP lane\" - officially known as the high-priority lane.",
      "Introduced in April 2020, the idea was to fast-track offers to supply PPE if they came with a recommendation from ministers, MPs, members of the House of Lords or other senior officials.",
      "At the time the government said there was a \"desperate need\" to protect health and social care staff, and it was argued swift action was required to secure PPE.",
      "New research for the Covid inquiry found almost a third of government contracts to buy masks, gowns and other equipment had gone through the VIP lane.",
      "Data showed that, of the 430 offers made in that way, 115 were successful. Those firms were 17 times more likely to win a contract than those outside the VIP lane system.",
      "Peter Munro, policy manager at the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition, a group made up of procurement, transparency and contract specialists, said the latest data \"confirmed some of our worst fears\".",
      "\"PPE procured through the high priority lane was 80% more expensive than PPE procured through other channels, and half if it was unfit for purpose,\" he said."

      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",

      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",

      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",

      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",

      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",

      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",

She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",

      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".

    "story": [
      "The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out.",
      "Sources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had \u00a39.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK.",
      "The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money.",
      "The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending.",
      "Such rules are put in place by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.",
      "Insiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty for hiking up government borrowing costs.",
      "'Huge rise in welfare spending'",
      "Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training.",
      "\"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added.",
      "Mahmood declined to comment on whether the justice department would face cuts, saying she was \"not going to get ahead\" of Treasury announcements.",
      "Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic.",
      "That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives in the system.",
      "People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\".",
      "But Fire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\".",
      "Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments",
      "The seven bills due to go up in April",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "The chancellor is set to argue that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\".",
      "An insider told the BBC: \"Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks.\"",
      "This week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Trump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves told the BBC on Tuesday that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation.",
      "Meanwhile, uncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid.",
      "One government insider told the BBC: \"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes.",
      "\"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\"",
      "It is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast.",
      "But there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy.",
      "Some firms have warned the higher tax will likely be passed on through increased prices for customers.",
      "Inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, is expect to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills, among others.",
      "In the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "summary": "The former prime minister examines his time in Downing Street, with the BBC's Nick Robinson for Political Thinking.",
    "story": [
      "There is one phrase, one slogan, one promise which is associated with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak more than any other.",
      "It is \"Stop the Boats\".",
      "Yet, in his first wide-ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former prime minister says he regrets ever saying it because it was \"too stark..too binary\".",
      "And he concedes that it couldn't actually be delivered.",
      "This is just one of the \"lessons from Downing Street\" which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says he's learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast.",
      "It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he could've implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister.",
      "Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didn't \"probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it.\"",
      "That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one.",
      "The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and there'd been no election of party members or the wider public.",
      "\"I didn't have a mandate,\" he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together.",
      "To do otherwise, he says, \"would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I don't think so. I think what the country needed was stability.\"",
      "He's not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if it's not reformed.",
      "He says the court has \"taken on new powers. There's been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave.\"",
      "When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he \"took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration down\u2026I should have done them sooner\".",
      "Stopping small boats is a priority for people - Sunak",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGI's in Teesside after a game of bowling.",
      "Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor.",
      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",
      "\"You've just got to focus on doing your best, doing what you're there to do, and not worry about the rest,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a very helpful concept for me\u2026I kept coming back to that. I said, 'look, this is my job. This is what I'm here to do. I'm well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is facing'.\"",
      "Bringing the economy back under control after the markets panicked in the face of Truss's unfunded tax cuts \u2013 or what he calls \"fantasy economics\" - is the achievement he's clearly proudest of.",
      "However, he spells out for the first time the scale of the disagreements he had not just with Truss, but with Boris Johnson, who he served as Chancellor.",
      "\"He and I had quite different views on economic policy. I'm a small state conservative. I believe in prioritising, trying to restrain the growth of public spending, being careful with our borrowing so that we can cut people's taxes...he was less worried about those things.\"",
      "He tells me that at their regular Sunday night dinners in Downing Street they argued over what could and could not be afforded.",
      "He says his worries were inflation and interest rates rising, because \"when they go up it's going to have a big impact on our public finances, because we're going to have to pay more to service the debt that we've got\".",
      "He adds: \"We cannot afford to keep spending and borrowing at this rate, and that means you have to prioritise. We can't do everything.\"",
      "Sunak insisted that any plan to subsidise people's social care costs had to be paid for by higher taxes.",
      "Now he thinks \"we're having another review now...I tell you, the answer is, do we as a country think it's right to pay more taxes for a more generous social care policy? Yes or no? I personally think the answer is no.\"",
      "He believed in slashing billions from welfare bills, a more \"radical restructuring of the state\" to pay for increased defence spending, and he says he told Johnson that the UK's net zero obligations were saddling the economy with cost.",
      "Now he argues for abandoning the legal commitment to deliver net zero, made law by another Tory leader Theresa May.",
      "During the Covid pandemic both Sunak and Johnson faced fixed term penalties for breaking lockdown rules.",
      "Sunak tells me he thought long and hard about resigning after that but says he had a job to do and he clearly can still scarcely believe that he was fined for turning up at a work meeting early where a cake was produced for the prime minister's birthday.",
      "Much more interesting is the lesson he draws from that period.",
      "We should all have been treated more like grown-ups, he tells me, and the public should have told that \"even the scientists themselves are not united on this, or they don't 100% know that this is the right thing to do\".",
      "The long-term negative consequences of lockdown measures should have been spelt out because, he says, \"we've seen the impact it's had on school kids everywhere and the impact it's had on their learning. And we probably didn't talk about that as much as we could have done at the time.\"",
      "Sunak is proud to have been the first British Asian prime minister and talks movingly of the moment his grandfather \u2013 who'd been born poor in an Indian village \u2013 calling an old friend at home with tears in his eyes on his first visit to Westminster.",
      "He's angry too with those like a popular podcaster who declared recently: \"He's a brown Hindu; how is he English.\"",
      "\"Of course I'm English, born here, brought up here,\" he says.",
      "\"On this definition, you can't be English even playing for England, let alone supporting them... I genuinely thought it was ridiculous.\"",
      "Here is a man proud of his roots and ready to admit mistakes, but who is wondering whether his rise to the top all happened before the country knew him, and could see beyond the super-wealthy Tory who was the fifth Tory leader in just six years.",
      "\"It's a lonely job,\" he says, \"because it is 100% only on you.\"",
      "Many were sure that he'd called the election early to head off to a new life in California.",
      "Nonsense, he says, he lives here because it's home and indeed has just set up a charitable foundation \u2013 the Richmond Project \u2013 named after the constituency in Yorkshire, which he's still proud to represent in Parliament.",

    "summary": "The announcement of new support for courts comes as two reports warn the justice system is struggling.",
    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

      "Asked about Vance's comments later, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the vice-president did not call Britain a \"random country\".",

      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",
      "Warm reception for Zelensky as he meets King at Sandringham",
      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",
      "Blue and yellow flowers as Queen meets Trudeau",
      "The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump.",

      "\"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,\" Ann said in an email to the newsletter.",
      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",

      "She is the first to resign over policy.",
      "Although she says she will support the PM from the backbenches, her letter of resignation delivered a coruscating critique.",
      "She - along with most Labour MPs \u2013 recognises defence spending needs to rise, but she disagrees with how it is being funded.",
      "She suggests that Britain's reputation will be damaged - but she is also denting her leader's.",
      "In effect, she is saying he is being misleading over the effect of the cuts, which will \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people\".",

      "Labour MPs have been remarkably disciplined in not publicly opposing policies which privately make them queasy, but there are fears of over forthcoming welfare cuts and there has been discontent over the winter fuel allowance, the two child benefit cap, and lack of compensation for Waspi women.",
      "So will Anneliese Dodds's resignation loosen the tongues of other discontented MPs?",
      "While it was widely expected that Keir Starmer would move robustly away from the politics and poses of the Corbyn years, some of the current contingent of MPs are concerned that he is moving away from commitments made by his predecessors  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown too.",
      "It was Blair who announced the move to the aid target of 0.7% of GDP \u2013 a commitment subsequently delivered by David Cameron despite an era of austerity.",
      "It was Brown who introduced a universal winter fuel payment for pensioners.",

      "They want to see a greater emphasis on patriotism and a tougher line on immigration.",
      "So apparently putting Britain first \u2013 more spent on defence here, less spending overseas \u2013 will be seen by some as a way of inoculating themselves against the growing threat of Reform.",

      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London.",
      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",

      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",

      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",

      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",

    "summary": "The government wants to adopt a scheme which encourages inmates to gain qualifications and take jobs.",
    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

      "Those are the startling claims being made by a US company that said on Tuesday it had created mice with \"mammoth-like traits\". Colossal Biosciences' eventual goal is to engineer mammoth-like creatures that could help stop arctic permafrost from melting.",
      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",
      "\"We are on track to have the first cold adapted elephant by 2028 and that would mean having the first embryos by the end of 2026,\" he said.",
      "\"Over time we are going to have this entire lineage of cold adapted elephants that we can put back into the wild that can interbreed\"",
      "The woolly mice had eight of their genes modified: seven were adapted mice genes related to hair growth and the eighth was a mammoth gene related to increasing body fat.",
      "The researchers found that the animals had longer, curlier hair, but no evidence that the mammoth's fat-increasing gene had an effect.",
      "Colossal Biosciences work has been met with scepticism from scientists not employed by the company. Their concerns include:",

      "In response, the Colossal researchers say they feel misjudged. Their mouse is a tool, they say, with which to test whether different genetic alterations they have planned are effective and safe before they try them out on elephants.",
      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

    "story": [
      "The world's largest iceberg has run aground in shallow waters off the remote British island of South Georgia, home to millions of penguins and seals.",
      "The iceberg, which is about twice the size of Greater London, appears to be stuck and should start breaking up on the island's south-west shores.",
      "Fishermen fear they will be forced to battle with vast chunks of ice, and it could affect some macaroni penguins feeding in the area.",
      "But scientists in Antarctica say that huge amounts of nutrients are locked inside the ice, and that as it melts, it could create an explosion of life in the ocean.",
      "\"It's like dropping a nutrient bomb into the middle of an empty desert,\" says Prof Nadine Johnston from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "Ecologist Mark Belchier who advises the South Georgia government said: \"If it breaks up, the resulting icebergs are likely to present a hazard to vessels as they move in the local currents and could restrict vessels' access to local fishing grounds.\"",
      "The stranding is the latest twist in an almost 40-year story that began when the mega chunk of ice broke off the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986.",
      "We have tracked its route on satellite pictures since December when it finally broke free after being trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "As it moved north through warmer waters nicknamed iceberg alley, it remained remarkably intact. For a few days, it even appeared to spin on the spot, before speeding up in mid-February travelling at about 20 miles (30km) a day.",
      "\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.",
      "On Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.",
      "\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "It is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.",
      "\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.",
      "Tides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.",
      "\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.",
      "But where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.",
      "\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "That is catastrophic in the short-term for these species, but he says that it is a natural part of the life cycle in the region.",
      "\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.",
      "There had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.",
      "But experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.",
      "Some Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.",
      "The birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.",
      "The ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.",
      "\"This will be the most ice from an iceberg we will have ever dealt with in a fishing season, but we are well-prepared and resourced,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes.",
      "But scientists working in Antarctica currently are also discovering the incredible contributions that icebergs make to ocean life.",
      "Prof Griffiths and Prof Johnston are working on the Sir David Attenborough ship collecting evidence of what their team believe is a huge flow of nutrients from ice in Antarctica across Earth.",

    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "The orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.",
      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",

      "France bans captive breeding of dolphins",
      "The ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.",
      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",

      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",

      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",

      "Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.",
      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",

      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",

      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",

Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",

    "story": [
      "Skype, the video-calling service that had hundreds of millions of users, is closing in May, its owner Microsoft has said.",
      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",
      "First released in 2003, Skype was bought by the tech giant in 2011 for $8.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) - its biggest-ever acquisition at the time.",
      "As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices.",

      "\"My best friend and I share many good memories on Skype,\" one X user said. \"This is a sad day and almost a feeling of losing yet another fragment of my adolescence.\"",
      "Another early user of Skype called Louise told the BBC she and her partner used the service to chat when they \"embarked on a transatlantic relationship\".",
      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",
      "\"It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really.\"",
      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",

      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

      "\"In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',\" he said.",

      "Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.",
      "Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show \"we are in a position to act independently in Europe\".",
      "At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by \"mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded\".",
      "Merz said, in English, he would do \"whatever it takes\" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president.",
      "At the heart of his proposals is a special \u20ac500bn (\u00a3415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence.",
      "In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a \"debt brake\" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times.",
      "The new defence proposal recommends that \"necessary defence spending\" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit.",
      "Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded.",
      "Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a \u20ac100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated.",
      "Germany will have to find an extra \u20ac30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%.",
      "Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions.",
      "The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party.",
      "However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament.",
      "Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a \"big, important step\" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday.",

      "Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: \"Our country is wearing itself out.\"",
      "Loans of \u20ac500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; \u20ac100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too."

    "story": [
      "China has set an economic growth target for this year of \"around 5%\" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US.",
      "Its leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.",
      "But the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most.",
      "President Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "This follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports.",
      "Beijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans.",
      "At the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the \"main engine and anchor\" of its economic growth.",
      "Beijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus.",
      "Repeating that is going to be much harder this year.",
      "\"If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics.",
      "Beijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges.",
      "The spending crunch",
      "On Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to \"vigorously boost\" household demand.",
      "\"Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough.\"",
      "\"Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,\" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world.",
      "Beijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices.",
      "The government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment.",
      "Beijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; \u00a3140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual \"Work Report\".",
      "In a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades.",
      "The hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline.",
      "It also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year.",
      "The government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population.",
      "Whether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question.",
      "Harsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.",
      "But China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was \"important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant\".",
      "'High quality' development",

    "story": [
      "A $53bn (\u00a341.4 billion) reconstruction plan to rival President Donald Trump's idea for the US to \"take over Gaza\" and move out more than two million Palestinians has been approved by Arab leaders at an emergency summit in the Egyptian capital Cairo.",
      "\"The Egypt plan is now an Arab plan,\" announced the secretary general of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit at the end of this hours-long gathering.",
      "Without referring specifically to President Trump's ideas, he underlined that \"the Arab stance is to reject any displacement, whether it is voluntary or forced\".",
      "Egypt had produced a detailed blueprint, with a 91-page glossy document including images of leafy neighbourhoods and grand public buildings, to counter a US scheme labelled as a \"Middle East Riviera\" which shocked the Arab world and beyond.",
      "Gazans face tough choices as their future is debated on the global stage",
      "Gaza ceasefire in peril as Israel and Hamas hit impasse",
      "Why does Trump want to take over Gaza and could he do it?",
      "What sets this new plan apart is it is not just about property development; its banners are politics and the rights of Palestinians.",
      "In his opening remarks, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi also called for a parallel plan alongside the physical reconstruction to move towards what is known as the two state solution \u2013 a Palestinian state alongside Israel. This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.",
      "This new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.",
      "It glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.",
      "Some Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.",
      "The other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.",
      "And a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.",
      "Wealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.",
      "A fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.",
      "This new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.",
      "During this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.",
      "President Trump continues to wonder aloud \"Why wouldn't they want to move?\" His description of Gaza as a \"demolition site\" underlines how the territory lies in utter ruin. The UN says 90% of homes are damaged or destroyed.",
      "All the basics of a life worth living, from schools and hospitals to sewage systems and electricity lines, are shredded.",
      "The US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".",
      "\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"",

      "There are also lessons learned from other ravaged cities which rose from the ruins including Hiroshima, Beirut, and Berlin. And the proposed designs are also influenced by Egypt's own experience in developing its \"New Cairo\", its grand megaproject which has seen a new administrative capital rising from the desert \u2013 at great expense.",
      "The American President has said he won't \"force\" his ideas on anyone but still insists his plan is the one \"that really works\".",
      "Now it is up to the Arab states and their allies to prove that their plan is the only plan."

    "summary": "Africa's Sahel region accounts for more than half of terror-related killings, a new reports says.",
    "story": [
      "The Sahel region of Africa is the \"epicentre of global terrorism\" and now, for the first time, accounts for \"over half of all terrorism-related deaths\", according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI).",
      "Its new report says that in this semi-arid area to the south of the Sahara Desert 3,885 people out of a worldwide total of 7,555 died.",
      "The GTI report adds that while the global figure has declined from a peak of 11,000 in 2015 the figure for the Sahel has increased nearly tenfold since 2019, as extremist and insurgent groups \"continue to shift their focus\" towards the region.",
      "The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think-tank dedicated to researching global peace and conflict.",
      "It defines terrorism as the \"threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation\".",
      "The Sahel stretches from the west coast of Africa eastwards across the continent. The GTI's definition of the region includes parts of 10 countries: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Guinea, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Mauritania.",
      "The Sahel has some of the world's highest birth rates, and almost two-thirds of the population is under 25.",
      "Unlike in the West where \"lone actor terrorism is on the rise\", the Sahel, has seen the rapid expansion of militant jihadist groups, according to the report.",
      "It says most of the attacks there were carried out by two organisations: the Islamic State group affiliate in the Sahel and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) - a branch of al-Qaeda.",
      "\"They're trying to introduce new legal orders,\" explains Niagal\u00e9 Bagayoko, chair of the African Security Sector Network. \"They're trying to administer justice in particular based on Sharia.\"",
      "And in the process, she says they \"are competing with one another\" for land and influence.",
      "IS-Sahel has reportedly doubled the amount of territory it controls in Mali since the country's coups of 2020 and 2021 - largely in the east near its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger - while JNIM also continued to expand its reach, according to a UN panel of experts on Mali.",
      "The GTI report notes that both groups have recruited more fighters, including child soldiers in the case of IS.",
      "\"In some instances, people tend to be in a point of choicelessness by the time they decide to join a militant group,\" says Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst specialising in Francophone Africa at Control Risks, a geopolitical risk consultancy. \"These are communities that are very vulnerable.\"",
      "The GTI report explains how political instability and weak governance are creating ideal conditions for insurgent groups to grow, pointing to conflict as \"the primary driver of terrorism\".",
      "The Sahel is sometimes referred to as the \"coup belt\" of Africa.",
      "Since 2020 there have been six successful coups in the region as defined by the GTI report: two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea and one in Niger. These countries are now all run by military juntas.",

      "PODCAST: The Sahel\u2019s coup contagion",
      "\"The Sahel has experienced a breakdown in state society,\" says Dr Folahanmi Aina, an expert on the region at SOAS University in London.",
      "\"It's been informed by years of neglect from political leaders who haven't necessarily prioritised people-centred governance and local grievances have festered, resulting in terror groups trying to leverage these.\"",
      "There was a perception that civilian governments were unable to combat security threats from insurgent groups, \"but despite these juntas taking over, they haven't necessarily improved optics on the ground and in fact insecurity has worsened,\" says Dr Aina. \"The juntas are professionally unprepared for the rigours of governance.\"",
      "In fact in 2024, Burkina Faso \"remained the country most affected by terrorism for the second year in a row\" according to the GTI.",
      "In the 14 years since the report began, it is the only country to top the list that is not Iraq or Afghanistan.",
      "Jihadist groups sustain their operations in the Sahel with a range of illicit economic activities, including kidnap for ransom and cattle rustling, according to the GTI report.",
      "The region has also become a key route for drug traffickers bringing cocaine from South America to Europe, and the report notes that \"drug trafficking represents one of the most financially lucrative illicit activities linked to terrorism in the Sahel\".",
      "It points out that that some groups veer away from directly engaging in organised crime, however, preferring to \"make money by imposing taxes or providing security and protection in exchange for payment\".",
      "It goes on to explain: \"This model not only generates revenue but also helps these groups integrate into local communities, strengthening their influence.\"",
      "Insurgent groups are also vying for control of the Sahel's rich natural resources. Niger is the world's seventh-largest producer of uranium, and unregulated artisanal gold mines found throughout the region are often taken advantage of by the likes of IS-Sahel and JNIM.",
      "Following the recent wave of coups, Sahel governments have pivoted away from Western allies, such as France and the US, towards China and Russia for support in tackling militants.",
      "\"Right now we're seeing that Russia is taking more assertive control over Russian paramilitaries in the region known as the Africa Corps [formerly Wagner],\" says Ms Ochieng. \"Their work is to train and support the local armies to be able to counter the insurgency in the region, but so far it hasn't been effective.\"",
      "As a result, the GTI report warns that there is now a risk of overspill beyond the so-called \"epicentre of terror\" to neighbouring countries.",
      "In fact, it says this may already be happening - Togo recorded 10 attacks and 52 deaths in 2024, the most since the index began. These were largely concentrated along the country's border with Burkina Faso.",
      "Ms Ochieng agrees with this assessment, saying that \"the expansion of militant groups within the region in countries like Benin or Togo or other coastal West African states seems to be imminent\".",

    "summary": "BBC Verify has looked into several claims made by Trump during his speech to Congress.",
    "story": [
      "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.",
      "He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.",
      "BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.",
      "Did Trump inherit an economic catastrophe?",
      "Trump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.",
      "This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.",
      "The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.",
      "On rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".",
      "Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.",
      "The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.",
      "Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.",
      "Did Biden let egg prices get out of control?",
      "Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".",
      "Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.",
      "Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.",
      "The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.",
      "The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.",
      "The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.",
      "Has Doge found hundreds of billions in fraud?",
      "Trump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.",
      "No evidence has been provided for this figure.",
      "On its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.",
      "However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.",
      "US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.",
      "Was February the lowest ever month for border crossings?",
      "Speaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".",
      "This is true.",
      "In February 2025, there were 8,326 encounters at the southwest border with Mexico  - by US border patrol.",
      "This is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.",
      "By comparison, there were about 140,000 encounters by US border patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. Numbers fell for the rest of the year to 96,000 at the end of 2024.",
      "Did 21 million migrants enter US under Biden?",
      "Continuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".",
      "There is no evidence for a figure this high.",
      "Encounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.",
      "It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.",
      "A report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.",
      "It says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.",
      "Has the US spent $350bn on Ukraine?",
      "On US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bn\u2026 and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\"",
      "BBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.",
      "The US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.",
      "It calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn.",

    "story": [
      "Elissa Slotkin, a US Senate Democrat, gave her party's response to Trump's congressional address, taking the new Trump administration to task for bringing with it chaos and recklessness.",
      "Early in her remarks, she attacked the White House on the economy and warned that if Trump was \"not careful, he could walk us right into a recession\".",
      "Slotkin also took a shot at the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting project led by Elon Musk, saying change is needed \"but doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe\".",
      "Speaking from Michigan before a backdrop of US flags, Slotkin was much more concise and much less animated than the president, who regaled Republicans on the House floor for an hour and 40 minutes.",
      "She made a quick reference to Democrats' stinging election defeat in November, but then quickly pivoted to Trump.",
      "\"Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change,\" she said.",
      "\"But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.\"",
      "Throughout the election, voters frequently said the economy was their number one concern, and Democrats' defeat was blamed on not addressing it sufficiently.",
      "Weeks into Trump's presidency, economic concerns remain high, as prices of a number of goods have not dropped, and prices on some items, like eggs, have risen.",
      "\"Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2013 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either,\" she said.",
      "Slotkin also talked about immigration, another topic where Democrats poll worse than Republicans, highlighting a lack of empathy by the Trump administration toward undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"The border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants,\" she said.",
      "She cited the public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday during a meeting withTrump and Vice-President JD Vance, too.",
      "\"That scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world,\" she said.",
      "\"He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth.\"",
      "For many, Tuesday night was their first time meeting Slotkin, who won the US Senate seat in the swing state of Michigan last year.",
      "A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst, Slotkin became the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate at 48, when she won her seat in a state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost last November.",
      "Slotkin gave her speech after Trump's, which is not a traditional State of the Union address but was expected to serve the same purpose.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Slotkin a \"rising star\" in the party last week as he announced her as the pick to provide the Democratic Party's rebuttal. He said she was \"great on both economic and national security\" topics.",
      "Slotkin is new to the Senate, but she served in Congress as a member of Michigan's delegation to the House of Representatives. She was first elected in the Democrats' 2018 wave of success, flipping a Republican seat.",
      "Prior to her political career, she held a variety of government jobs. She held national security positions in Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama's administrations.",
      "She served in Bush's National Security Council, and, under Obama, she served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs and in the State Department.",
      "The CIA recruited Slotkin, who is fluent in Arabic and Swahili, shortly after she earned a graduate degree in international affairs at Columbia University in New York City. She served three tours in Iraq as a CIA analyst.",
      "The moderate Democrat focused her 2024 Senate campaign on lowering costs for Americans, a move that helped propel her to a narrow victory over former Congressman Mike Rogers, even as Trump won the state.",

      "The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely.",
      "The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well.",
      "Europe is scrambling to react effectively.",

      "It is a huge moment in European history.",

      "But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving?",
      "Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for \"action not words\". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine\", with urgent, extra arms deliveries.",
      "Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities.",
      "Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold:",
      "First, to show Donald Trump that \u2014 in the words of the UK prime minister \u2014 Europe will now do the \"heavy lifting\" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer \"freeloading\" off the United States.",
      "But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms.",

      "Russia is watching too.",
      "The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable.",

      "Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that \u2014 at least in the short-to-medium term \u2014 Europe still needs the US.",
      "That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump.",
      "The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War.",
      "The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support.",
      "If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed \u2014 that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences.",
      "That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that \"coalition\". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe.",
      "Can Europe fill the gap now the US has paused military support for Ukraine?",
      "What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine",
      "But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as \"enablers\".",
      "Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia.",
      "A European peacekeeping or \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary.",

    "summary": "There are efforts under way to recycle and reuse more at what has been dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
    "story": [
      "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
      "But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.",
      "Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.",
      "Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.",
      "Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.",
      "To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.",
      "Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.",
      "\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.",
      "The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.",
      "Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.",
      "Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.",
      "Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.",
      "Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly",
      "Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.",
      "The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.",
      "Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"",
      "Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".",
      "They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.",
      "In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.",
      "\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.",
      "After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.",
      "\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.",
      "But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.",
      "At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.",
      "The organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.",
      "It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.",
      "\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.",
      "Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.",
      "These green efforts are being welcomed by patrons such as Roland Riley, who hailed it as \"a good initiative by Fete with the Saints to go that route\".",

      "Actor Ione Skye, known for her breakout role in the 1989 film \"Say Anything,\" is giving fans a look behind her glamorous but tumultuous Hollywood life in a new memoir titled \"Say Everything.\"",
      "In her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.",
      "\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.",
      "The memoir also details her relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, which began when she was 16 and he was 24.",
      "\"I liked the idea of this dangerous dark prince of a rock n' roller,\" she writes, though her perspective has shifted with time.",
      "\"It shocks me. And I also feel bad for myself,\" Skye said. \"I'm happy I knew Anthony Kiedis and \u00a0[Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist] Flea, but I wish I'd met them ten years later and never dated them.\"",
      "Kiedis struggled with heroin addiction during their relationship. When asked why she stayed, Skye said: \"I thought I had to save him.\"",
      "The actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on \u2013 even more than 25 years later.",
      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",
      "She said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.",
      "Much of Skye's memoir explores how her relationships were shaped by the absence of her father, Scottish singer Donovan Leitch, who left when she was born.",
      "\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.",
      "The book reveals a disturbing chapter when Leitch's attorney sent a letter requesting a paternity test when Skye was already a successful actress.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",
      "Ultimately, Skye decided against taking the paternity test. Skye says she didn't meet her father until just before her 18th birthday.",
      "\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"",
      "Skye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fianc\u00e9, designer David Netto.",
      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",
      "Now living in Australia with her husband, musician Ben Lee, and their family, Skye says they share the same unique experience of early fame.",
      "\"Our careers were really big when we were teenagers and we've both had to deal with the ups and downs of keeping our careers going,\" she said.",
      "Five years ago, Skye took her family to visit her father and stepmother in Ireland, a trip she describes as healing. She also found connection with her father through her role in the film \"Zodiac,\" which featured one of his songs.",
      "Reflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"",
      "\"I felt very proud. I felt like I learned a lot about myself,\" she said. \"I felt like it's a bit of whiplash for a long time, but I do settle in a nice place.\"",

      "Disney, the most decorated Oscar winner of all time, won for best documentary (feature), best documentary (short), best short subject (cartoon) and best short subject (two-reel) at the 26th Academy Awards. He won these awards, respectively, for \"Water Birds,\" \"The Living Desert,\" \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Bloom,\" and \"Bear Country.\"",

The only one not nabbed was best supporting actor, which went to Kieran Culkin for \"A Real Pain.\"",
      "As the writer, editor and director of \"Anora,\" Baker himself won four Oscars for the film, setting a record for most Oscars won by one person for a single film. Mikey Madison took home the fifth with her best actress win.",
      "In his remarks on stage after winning the Oscar for best editing, Baker said only three individuals are allowed in the editing room with him.",

      "Baker, whose wife, Samathan Quan, co-produced \"Anora,\"\u00a0revealed to NPR that he had a $6 million budget for the independent film, distributed by Neon.

      "At the\u00a097th annual Academy Awards, presented on March 2, \"Anora\" won five Oscars, including for best picture. Watch scenes from \"Anora\" and the other nominated movies below, along with interviews with the filmmakers.",
      "\"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's Cinderella story \"Anora\" was a surprise winner of the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival \u2014 a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the young, na\u00efve son of Russian oligarchs who decide the marriage must be broken up at all costs.",
      "The film brings a humanity to the strivings of Anora (who favors the name Ani), a young woman who realizes too late that virtually no one around her has her best interests at heart \u2014 not even her newly-hitched husband.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2014 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "A former NYU film student, Sean Baker had not slipped into the Hollywood industry like some of his classmates, including Todd Phillips (\"Joker\"), instead making small independent features (\"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine,\" \"Red Rocket\") that focused on people living on the margins of mainstream society, cast with both professional actors and non-actors.",
      "After contemplating \"a bro movie with Russian gangsters,\" he switched to a story of a sex worker in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. He and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, moved there to absorb the atmosphere. \"We don't like to go to a place and say we're just going to get a surface view,\" Baker told the Associated Press. \"We really embed ourselves in that place. We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle. Up until fairly recently, I was struggling to pay rent.\"",
      "Madison told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Heavily influenced by 1970s New York films like \"The French Connection\" and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" Baker shot \"Anora\" on 35mm. \"We're living in a day and age where the technology, analog meeting digital right now, actually opens up so many doors to the artists,\" Baker told Forbes. \"I mean, you can shoot on film and capture your images on this gorgeous medium, but then you have the digital tools to help clean up and perfect. We're living in a great time. I wish more filmmakers would appreciate the fact that using tools from both sides of years of technology is a wonderful thing.\"",
      "\"Anora,\" a Neon release, won best film at the Producers Guild of America Awards and at the Spirit Awards. It is now playing in theaters and is available via VOD.",
      "UPDATE: \"Anora\" won five Academy Awards on Sunday, four of which went to Baker, for best original screenplay, best editing, best director and best picture. He was the first person to ever win four Oscars for the same film.\u00a0 Mikey Madison also won for best actress.",
      "In one of his many acceptance speeches, Baker called out for preserving the theater-going movie experience, as cinemas are struggling to survive: \"In a time in which the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever,\" he said. \"It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home. If we don't reverse this trend, we'll be losing a vital part of our culture. This is my battle cry.\"",

      "\"The Brutalist\"",
      "In director Brady Corbet's period drama \"The Brutalist,\" Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States to revive his career, and finds both opportunity and friction as he tries to pursue his artistic inclinations.",
      "In the film's stirring opening scene, T\u00f3th arrives in New York Harbor, with a skewed view of the Statue of Liberty that portends an unequal assimilation into the promise of America. (Cinematography by Lol Crawley. Music by Daniel Blumberg.)",
      "Brody, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musician struggling to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" is nominated for his performance as T\u00f3th, who is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2014 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. But Toth's ambitions clash with his patron, who seeks in T\u00f3th a talent he wishes to dominate.",
      "In this extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Brody described his performance as T\u00f3th and the influence of his mother, the acclaimed photographer Sylvia Plachy: \"I've had a lifetime of influences and preparation so to speak to portray L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in this movie. It's a character that I relate to many things, and I see a lot of parallels in my own yearnings as an artist and in the yearnings of the people that I collaborate with. I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature. It's the difference between a bowl from Crate & Barrel and a wabi-sabi ceramic.\"",
      "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was hailed as a \"masterpiece,\" Corbet remarked on questions about its length: \"This film does everything that we are told we are not allowed to do. I think it's quite silly, actually, to have a conversation about run time, because that's like criticizing a book for being 700 pages versus 100 pages.\"",
      "At the end of \"The Brutalist,\" T\u00f3th is quoted as saying, \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\" \"I don't think that that sentiment applies to my journey at all,\" Brody told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"but I do find it very beautiful and telling to the storytelling of the film. You have to be very present and embrace the journey, because that is all you've got while you're here. I mean, a part of me would love to be proud of the body of work that I leave behind, but I won't be around to look back at it, so hopefully I bring more good than bad and negativity into this world, and that's what I strive for.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA awards for his performance, while \"The Brutalist\" won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama and best director. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director.",

      "\"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "In this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon to the cardinals about the value of uncertainty, little knowing that, for much of the film, he will be on a quest for understanding \u2014 questioning his own doubt \u2014 to attain a kind of certainty that, for Lawrence, may represent truth.",
      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",
      "\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"",
      "And did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Berger talked with the Hollywood Reporter about the film's themes: \"It is a wonderful topic for a political thriller, not [just] for a religious thriller,\" he said. \"This could take place anywhere. It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well. And I always think that, in a way, certainty creates antagonism and that's just going to make the other side stronger.\"",

Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won six.",
      "The sequel follows the ascension of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as a leader of the Indigenous Fremen tribes in combatting the forces of the ruling House Harkonnen.",
      "In this scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) engage in a Fremen attack on a Harkonnen spice harvester. The fast-moving action showcases how Villeneuve's staging, photography and pacing expertly define cinematic geography, as well as the limitations of technology \u2014 and the power of daredevil heroics:",
      "In this technical featurette from Variety, Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser (who won the Oscar for \"Part One\") discusses how camera movement, lenses, and shooting in natural light (as well as the combination of digital and film emulsions) mirror the emotions and journey of the characters, such as when Paul Atreides rides the giant sandworm.",
      "Fraser noted, \"The biggest challenge is, worms don't exist.\" Well, yeah, that is a problem! Thankfully, the film's visual effects team (also nominated) provided the solution. You can watch the sandworm sequence below \u2014 a scene of remarkable anticipation, drama, and visual and sonic splendor for which Imax was created, as Paul's feat appears to satisfy a Fremen prophecy of a messianic figure.

And I really appreciated that.\"",
      "In this profile for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Gomez said shooting \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" left her \"a little sore from the dance numbers.\" So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"To be honest, I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",

It just felt so right,\" she said. \"The story is original, but it's also a story that a lot of people walk through. So, the way it was told was artistic and audacious and beautiful, but it is a true element where people crave and have a desire to live their life authentically, and whatever that looks like to them should never be judged. I thought that we did a good job encompassing that.\"",
      "\"Also, when I read the script, my character came across quite harsh in the beginning. Jacques was really wonderful with collaborating with me because I felt like adding a bit of softness to her would help.

The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line. It stipulated a before and an after, which obviously has to do with the moment when an authoritarian state invades the heart of a family. And that stayed with me for years and years and years.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has tapped into the public conscience in Brazil, where the collective memory about the nation's suffering under military rule across two decades is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. It became the fifth highest-grossing film in Brazil last year (behind Hollywood fare like \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" \"Moana 2\" and \"Despicable Me 4\"). The film won three awards at the Venice Film Festival, including for its director.",
      "Torres won the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress in a drama for her performance. She is the second Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is nominated for three Academy Awards, including best international feature film, best actress, and best picture. It is currently screening in theaters.",
      "\"Nickel Boys\"",
      "Colson Whitehead, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his novel \"The Underground Railroad,\" based his next novel, \"The Nickel Boys,\" on the tragedy of the Dozier School, a Florida reform school for boys in the Jim Crow South, which became notorious for its institutional abuse, torture and deaths of youth. Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",
      "In this trailer for the film, we experience life from the perspective of the protagonists:",
      "In this scene, Hattie (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), unable to see her grandson Elwood, approaches Turner (voice of Brandon Wilson) for help:",
      "In a New York Film Festival panel discussion, Ross, who had always wanted to make a POV film, said reading Whitehead's book was profound for him: \"And in the process of reading, it was the process of being allowed to imagine in a way that I think a lot of American writers aren't focused on.",
      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",
      "Brandon Wilson, who plays Turner, told CBS station KCAL in Los Angeles, \"I think this movie offers a beautiful invitation for people to let go of their own subjective points of view and step into the shoes of another person, and step into their eyes. I just hope they accept that invitation and allow themselves to be pulled into this world and release their own conditional point of view for a moment.\"",

      "\"The Substance\"",
      "Coralie Fargeat's body horror film \"The Substance\" stars best actress nominee Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "In this early scene, following a devastating career downturn and a car accident, Elisabeth breaks down under the watch of an ER doctor (Tom Morton), but then finds herself the focus of a sinister male nurse (Robin Greer). Why does he refer to her as \"a good candidate\"? And what is that strange birthmark on his forearm?",
      "The upshot? Elisabeth is offered access to a radical potion, a.k.a. The Substance, that promises \"a better version of yourself.\" What that entails, once a yellow liquid is injected into one's veins, is the creation of a new, younger duplicate of the person, ready to take their place. [Warning: There is a regimented schedule for injections; don't deviate!]",
      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",
      "In a Hollywood Reporter roundtable, Gargeat said that she would not call \"The Substance\" a horror film. \"I would call it more of a genre film, which is to me very wide \u2026 going from sci-fi to action to everything that is not grounded into reality. Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",
      "\"So, especially for that film and the previous one, that's really where I found my freedom and where I felt powerful and where I felt fully capable to express myself in a way that there are no boundaries. Also, where I love to go very much into the excess and kind of touch my part of, yeah, craziness \u2026 it felt totally relevant for it to be as excessive as what I wanted to say, and make the audience feel that excess and feel that craziness.",
      "\"So, that's it's even not a question where that I choose; it's just what I do,\" she said.",
      "The film has been recognized as an indictment of sexism and ageism, in a popular culture that denigrates women who have the temerity to get older. In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence. So, that's why also I wanted to make the movie that way.\"",
      "Moore won both the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, and was nominated for a BAFTA. The film is up for a total of five Academy Awards, including best picture. Coralie Fargeat received two nominations for best director and best original screenplay, and a third as producer.",

      "In the song \"Defying Gravity,\" from \"Wicked,\" there is a lyric: \"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap.\" That resonated with the director, Jon M. Chu. \"It was the whole reason I did the movie,\" Chu told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"It's all about striving for that dream and being able to fight through the uncomfortable things to get there.\"",

Joe: Retaliation,\" \"Now You See Me 2\"), Chu said his view of \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which, when he was a child, represented a dream of another, better place \u2014 has changed since he was a kid. \"I think that that Yellow Brick Road is no longer the path that you just keep following, because there is no wizard there that's gonna give you your heart's desire,\" he said. \"Life is a series of walking adventures. And as you're walking, smell the flowers and feel the air. And maybe you'll realize you're actually flying.\"",
      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",
      "In this scene, the hunk, Fiyero, a transfer student at Shiz University, makes his case for living less studiously, especially as it affords more chances to engage in a rapturous dance number in the school's library:",
      "This behind-the-scenes featurette shows how Erivo performed her flying stunts while singing \"Defying Gravity.\" \u00a0And yes, the \"Wicked\" cast were not performing to pre-recorded vocal tracks; for most of the film, Grande, Erivo, et al, were recorded singing on set by live sound mixer Simon Hayes (an Oscar-winner for \"Les Miserables\"). While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Watch this featurette giving a more detailed look at how the sound of \"Wicked\" was captured:",
      "Speaking of the film adaptation, Maguire told CBS Boston, \"The fact that the story of 'Wicked' continues to be pertinent 30 years after it was first published shocks me, saddens me a little bit, because it's about social ills and political stress, but also encourages me because it means we're still looking for guidance and for comfort.\"",

Baker distinguished himself by winning all four awards for the same movie, while Disney won for four different projects at the 1954 ceremony.

      "TV funnyman Conan O'Brien\u00a0took the stage as host of the 97th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night as the 2025 Oscar nominees competed for top honors.",
      "O'Brien inherited hosting duties from fellow comedian and late-night star\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel, who presided over the Oscars four times before.",
      "\"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars,\" O'Brien said in a statement when he was announced as host.",
      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",
      "O'Brien joined an illustrious list of Oscar hosts that includes the likes of Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.",
      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",
      "Jimmy Kimmel, Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Lemmon have each hosted the show four times, while three-timers include Jerry Lewis and David Niven.",

      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony. That show, however, was overshadowed by\u00a0Will Smith slapping Chris Rock\u00a0in the face onstage over a joke Rock made about Smith's wife,\u00a0Jada Pinkett Smith.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hollywood-has-changed-filmmaking-in-the-age-of-streaming/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "One of Hollywood's finest actors, two-time Academy Award-winner Gene Hackman\u00a0died this past week at age 95. And while circumstances surrounding his death (along with his wife, Betsy Arakawa) remain very much a mystery, his legacy is in a class all its own.",

      "\"I think he definitely showed that, don't get pigeon-holed, don't get typecast, don't be just the tough guy \u2013 be everything else as well,\" said David Rooney, chief film critic for the Hollywood Reporter.",
      "What set Hackman apart? \"He was definitely part of a crop of interesting young Hollywood actors that kind of reinvented the mold,\" Rooney said. \"They were getting away from the traditional movie star, into something more approaching real people. He wasn't sort of a matinee idol-look, but it was at the point when people were looking beyond that to try and find some other kind of realism in movies.\"",
      "In \"Mississippi Burning,\" Brad Dourif's racist deputy received a close shave from Hackman's FBI agent. \"I made sure that the razor was actually not sharp!\" Dourif said.",
      "Gene Hackman and Brad Dourif in \"Mississippi Burning\":",
      "I asked, \"Do you think he raised your game in those scenes?\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Dourif replied. \"How could he not? I mean, the better you are, the better he is; the better he is, the better you are. And you're both aware of that.\"",
      "Dourif wasn't just a costar of Hackman's; he was an unabashed fan. \"I never really got over the fact that that was Gene Hackman, you know?\" he laughed. \"Oh my God, this is Gene Hackman! It's so sad that he's gone. But he was a treasure beyond belief.\"",
      "Rooney said, \"He had a reputation for being very tough on sets, very difficult, very impatient with actors who came unprepared. But I think that sometimes difficult is just another way of saying perfectionist.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",
      "More changes could be coming soon to the communications officials who remain. A current HHS official said staff within the team were asked to provide explanations of their \"roles and responsibilities\" by noon on Tuesday.",

      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",

      "The Trump administration has granted some waivers for U.S. officials to collaborate on other diseases, like allowing the CDC to work with the WHO on an Ebola outbreak in Uganda.",
      "Zhang's comments about the FDA's participation followed the release of this year's WHO recommendations for how the annual flu shot should be updated for the next flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. Experts and officials gather from around the world every February to come up with the updates.",
      "As part of that process, the FDA runs one of four WHO \"essential regulatory laboratories\" developing tests for the potency of influenza shots.",
      "One major change recommended by the WHO for the next flu season is an update to an ingredient that guards against strains of the virus called H3. Data from the U.S. suggests this season's vaccines were less effective for some kids in protecting against an H3 strain.",
      "\"The H3 component always gives us the most grief. It's constantly changing and evolving quicker than the other viruses,\" said Ian Barr of the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia, part of the WHO's network of influenza researchers and testing laboratories.",
      "WHO officials also said the U.S. had resumed sharing data within the global influenza system, making it available in time for the process of updating flu shots. Some of the sharing was done by publishing data to publicly available data platforms, instead of to WHO servers, as was standard in the past.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration unexpectedly canceled an annual meeting of its advisers to update next season's influenza vaccines, an adviser on the panel and multiple officials tell CBS News, upending the usual process to start manufacturing next winter's flu shots.",
      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",
      "Early data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's testing suggests that this past season's vaccine may have been a poor match for one of the common strains of the virus. More data on the effectiveness of the vaccine is expected to be released Thursday.",
      "The cancellation is just the latest federal vaccine meeting to be disrupted.",

    "story": [
      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse. Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",
      "Estimates for effectiveness in adults from the same network was 36%. That is similar to the 33% at this time last year.",

China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",

    "story": [
      "American consumers could soon face higher costs for a range of consumer products after President Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China went into effect on Tuesday.",
      "The 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tax on imports from China, will drive up the costs of an array of consumer goods, from groceries to automobiles, and could cause more financial strain for inflation-weary consumers, experts say.",
      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "The typical American family could face higher annual costs of between $1,600 to $2,000 due to the new tariffs, according to a new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan public policy research center.",
      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers. But some products that are made in the U.S. but which use imported materials could also see higher prices, such as automobiles that are manufactured domestically but rely on parts imported from Canada, Mexico or China.",
      "Consumers could start seeing higher prices for some products fairly quickly, such as gasoline, with some regions expected to see gas prices jump as much as 40 cents per gallon within days, according to GasBuddy energy analyst Patrick De Haan.",
      "But other goods, such as cars, might not reflect higher prices for several months, experts say.",
      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico in 2023. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",
      "Electronics",
      "The tariffs are likely to drive up prices on a range of consumer goods, including laptops and tablets, video game consoles and smartphones, according to an analysis from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).",
      "Computers, phones and other electronics could see prices jump by 11%, according to the Joint Economic Committee analysis.",
      "That's a reality electronics retailer Best Buy acknowledged last year\u00a0as Mr. Trump spoke about relying on tariffs to achieve his economic goals.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Automobiles",
      "Vehicles are expected to be hit hard by the tariffs, given their complex supply chains which can involve car parts crossing borders multiple times over the course of assembly, exposing them to the same levies more than once.",
      "The sweeping tariffs could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, which could dent automobile sales, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some automakers could ditch uneconomical product lines as a result of the tariffs. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Gasoline",
      "Fuel prices could quickly reflect the new tariffs, according to De Haan of GasBuddy. Oil, natural gas and electricity imported from Canada will be subject to a 10% levy that could lead to higher prices almost immediately for U.S. motorists.",
      "\"Some U.S. regions will see price impacts rather quickly, while others will see a delay of 1-3 weeks,\" De Haan wrote in a March 4 blog post.",
      "Drivers in the Northeast are likely to see the biggest immediate impact, with gas prices jump by between 20 to 40 cents per gallon by mid-March, he added. \"For a typical 15-gallon fill-up, that's an additional $3-$6 every time you visit the pump,\" he said.",
      "Other regions are also likely to see higher gas prices, with Midwest drivers seeing an increase of 5-20 cents per gallon and Great Lakes motorists likely to pay about 10-25 cents per gallon more due to the new tariffs, he added.",

But as the Trump administration puts China firmly in its economic crosshairs, there are concerns in Cambodia that the country's own economy could sustain collateral damage.",
      "\"They're totally dependent on exports to the U.S., and could become a target \u2014 a vulnerable target,\" Barnett said.",
      "For garment factory owner Mr. Huang, that would be devastating. He readily admitted to being concerned about the prospect of President Trump targeting goods like his \u2014 Chinese, but made in Cambodia \u2014 with new tariffs.",
      "No newcomer, Huang set up shop in Cambodia 20 years ago, capitalizing on the tax breaks and lower wages in the country, while still running factories in China. But when the trade war began in 2018, he moved all operations to Cambodia.",
      "He told CBS News that 60% of his business is in the U.S. market, with his goods going to familiar retailers including Walmart and Costco.",
      "Huang said incoming orders had multiplied since Mr. Trump announced his new tariffs on China, the latest round of which could take effect on Tuesday.",
      "An escalating U.S.-China trade war",
      "Mr. Trump imposed a 10% blanket\u00a0tariff on Chinese imports in early February, drawing retaliatory measures by China of 15% on imported U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars. Last week, Mr. Trump threatened China with another 10% duty on all imports, which would take effect Tuesday, resulting in a total 20% blanket tariff on all Chinse goods imported to the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump has imposed the tariffs on China, he says, for Beijing's failure to stem the flow of deadly fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Already, Beijing is planning more countermeasures.",
      "\"China is studying and formulating relevant countermeasures in response to the U.S. threat of imposing an additional 10% tariff on Chinese products under the pretext of fentanyl,\" the Global Times newspaper, largely considered a mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, reported on Monday, citing an anonymous source.",
      "\"The countermeasures will likely include both tariffs and a series of non-tariff measures, and U.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\" the newspaper said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment and will update with any response.",
      "Unless and until the escalating trade war sees Mr. Trump turn his favored economic weapon of tariffs on Cambodia, Huang told CBS News more Chinese companies will likely become his neighbors in the country.",
      "\"Of course,\" the businessman said. \"Many people tell me they need factory building, need to move immediately, because they think taxes are going up.\"",
      "He believes the trade war is bound to escalate, and he's convinced that Cambodia and other Southeast Asian countries are the future for Chinese manufacturers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

      "In a post on\u00a0Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, a group he set up through an executive order shortly after taking office, is moving forward with the crypto reserve, which will include Bitcoin, Ethereum and three smaller cryptocurrencies: XRP, Solana, and Cardano.",

      "A few minutes later, Trump posted again, noting that other valuable cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and ether would be at \"the heart of the Reserve,\" causing the price of the two major digital currencies to rise more than 10% and 12% respectively.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure,\u00a0rose\u00a02.5% in January on an annual basis, matching economists' expectations and providing some reassurance on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data earlier this month.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The January numbers match forecasts that the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",

    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",

      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "summary": "Consumers still coping with high food costs face scalding hot coffee prices, with retail costs up 75% in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",

      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",

      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has signaled it will move in court to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban\u200b, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's stand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration signaled Tuesday it will move to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban, even in the treatment of pregnant women suffering medical emergencies, a dramatic reversal from the previous administration in a closely watched lawsuit.",
      "The state's largest hospital system said it could be forced to airlift women out of state for care if the federal lawsuit is dismissed. That persuaded a judge to quickly grant a temporary order allowing doctors to keep providing abortions they deem necessary to treat emergencies.",
      "The move to dismiss the lawsuit originally filed by the Biden administration could come as soon as Wednesday, St. Luke's Health System wrote in a court filing, citing communication with the Justice Department.",
      "Dropping the case would be among the new administration's first major moves on abortion. In his first term, President Trump appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "History of legal battle over Idaho abortion ban",
      "In its original lawsuit against Idaho, the Biden administration argued that federal law required doctors to perform abortions in emergency situations if a patient's health or life were at serious risk - even if ending the pregnancy could run afoul of the state's abortion ban, one of the country's most restrictive.",
      "Idaho has pushed back, saying that its state law allows for abortions in life-threatening situations and that the Democratic administration was trying to improperly expand its exceptions.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year and ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations.",
      "The high court did not, however, resolve key legal questions in the case, and it was argued before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. The appeals court hasn't ruled yet.",
      "Idaho Deputy Attorney General Brian Church had urged the court to reject St. Luke's request for a restraining order, saying the hospital system was trying to reinterpret federal law and wrest control from the state legislature now that, \"the United States is abandoning its erroneous interpretation\" that federal law requires emergency abortions.",
      "\"It is now seeking to usurp the role of the Idaho Legislature in setting statewide medical standards of care,\" Church wrote. He said any changes to state policy should come from the ballot box, not the courts.",
      "When might emergency abortions be performed?",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "When Idaho was able to fully enforce its ban during medical emergencies, some Idaho doctors reported that pregnant women were facing delays in care and in some cases being flown to out-of-state hospitals for treatment they would have previously been able to get at home.",
      "\"My colleagues and I lived in constant fear that patients would present in an emergency room who were not stable enough to transfer, yet the medically indicated stabilizing care-termination-could not be provided because it was not yet needed to prevent the patient's death,\" one doctor said in court documents.",
      "While the law does allow for life-saving abortions, it's still impossible to tell exactly when a dire case crosses the line to potentially fatal in the eyes of the law, she wrote.",
      "In another abortion-related case this week, the Trump administration received additional time to make a filing - which would also give it time to change the government's position on the issue. In that case, the states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are seeking to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone. Under Mr. Biden, the government was defending access.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy - often before women realize they're pregnant.",

China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "A Canadian official confirmed to CBS News that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Canadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly intened to speak on Wednesday.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

As an example, not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism, 1 in 10,000. And now it's 1 in 36. There's something wrong, 1 in 36.\"",

      "While the CDC\u00a0says\u00a0those estimates are not nationally representative, other estimates from the National Survey of Children's Health show similar trends. The rise in estimates, however, may not stem from an increase in cases, according to the CDC.",

While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to\u00a0historical statistics.",

      "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the June 2022 inflation reading of 9% was the highest since November 1981. But inflation was higher for longer in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in April 1980 at 14.6%.",
      "That inflationary period was above 9% for around two years, and above the target 2% rate for nearly a decade. Under Biden, inflation was elevated for about two years as well, but at lower levels. Inflation stands at 3% as of January 2025.",

    "summary": "Sen. Elissa Slotkin was elected by a narrow margin in November to represent Michigan after serving several terms in the House.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin warned that the first weeks of President Trump's new administration have brought \"reckless\" approaches to the economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Slotkin spoke for roughly 10 minutes as she delivered the Democratic Party's official response to Mr. Trump's nearly two-hour, often campaign-style address to Congress\u00a0Tuesday night.",
      "What did Slotkin say in her response to Trump's speech?",
      "\"America wants change, but there's a responsible way to make change and a reckless way,\" Slotkin said.",
      "Slotkin pointed to perhaps the most well-known member of Mr. Trump's team, Elon Musk. The world's richest person was lauded by the president for leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a newly-branded agency tasked with dramatically shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "\"In order to pay for his plan, he may very well come after your Social Security,\" Slotkin said, referring to a comment Musk made recently calling the popular program a \"Ponzi scheme.\"",
      "Slotkin said the president should be focused on bringing \"down the price of things,\" listing groceries, housing and health care.",
      "\"The president talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close,\" Slotkin said, before recounting a claim frequently made about Trump's relationship with Musk and other ultra-wealthy supporters. \"President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America.\"",
      "She accused President Trump of levying tariffs that will ultimately lead to steeper prices for Americans,",
      "\"His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers,\" Slotkin said. \"Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your healthcare.\"",
      "Trump said earlier Tuesday that \"tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country.\"",
      "Slotkin, a former CIA officer, also harshly rebuked Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, honing in on the\u00a0televised argument last week between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"President Trump loves to say peace through strength. That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\" Slotkin said, implying Reagan would be more supportive of an adversary to Russia than Mr. Trump has been to Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his address that he is \"working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "Who is Elissa Slotkin?",
      "Slotkin was elected to the Senate in November. She previously represented Michigan in the House since 2019.",
      "The 48-year-old worked in national security roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations.",
      "Why did the Democrats choose Slotkin to deliver their response?",
      "As Slotkin noted in her speech, she and Mr. Trump both won in Michigan during November's election.",
      "While serving in the House, she had a reputation for working across the aisle, and promised on the campaign trail to continue her bipartisan efforts in the Senate.",
      "Slotkin cited her bipartisan credentials, nodding to the \"shared values\" in her upbringing, which\u00a0she said \"were bigger than any one party.\"",
      "Slotkin urged Americans not to \"tune out,\" saying \"America needs you more than ever.\"",
      "She said voters must hold elected officials accountable by going to town halls, organizing and taking action.",
      "Slotkin said it's not \"the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country.\" Slotkin later added that the nation has only survived those moments because of \"engaged citizens and principled leaders.\"",

On Monday, Melania Trump joined an event on Capitol Hill to throw her support behind a bill sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz to bolster safety against deepfakes.",
      "Another guest, January Littlejohn, of Tallahassee, Florida, sued her daughter's middle school over asking her daughter what bathroom she wanted to use, which the White House said was \"without January and her husband's knowledge or permission.\" Mr. Trump has already signed an executive order restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors, although transgender youth have sued to block the order.",
      "The White House invited Payton McNabb, a North Carolina teen, who was injured after a collision with a transgender athlete during a volleyball game. Mr. Trump has signed an executive order banning transgender women from women's sports, and McNabb was recently invited by the White House to attend a briefing on women's sports.",
      "Other guests included Jeff Denard, a Decatur, Alabama, steelworker; Haley Ferguson, a Tennessee woman who received a Fostering the Future scholarship, which was launched by the first lady's Be Best initiative; and Roberto Ortiz, a Border Patrol agent in Texas who the White House said has been shot at by cartel members.",

      "Green, 77, has represented a Houston, Texas, district in the House since 2005.",
      "The Texas Democrat has previously pushed to remove Mr. Trump from office, authoring articles of impeachment against him during the president's first term. He threatened to do so again last month after the president suggested the U.S. would take over Gaza.",
      "Why was Congressman Green escorted out of Trump's joint address?",
      "After Mr. Trump kicked off his speech declaring that \"America is back,\" to applause and chants of \"USA\" from Republicans, he celebrated his victory in the 2024 election, saying \"the presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\"",
      "As the president cited his victory in the swing states and claimed to have won the popular vote by \"big numbers,\" Green could be seen shouting as he stood and raised his cane in the president's direction.",

      "As Green continued, Johnson repeatedly urged him to take his seat, before directing the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "After he was removed from the chamber, Green told reporters that he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"Whatever the punishment is,\" Green said. \"I'm not fighting the punishment. This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor.\"",
      "Have other Democrats protested during Trump's speech?",
      "Green's interruption came after questions swirled about how Democrats would conduct themselves during Mr. Trump's address. A group of House Democratic women wore pink Tuesday night to protest how they say the president's policies are \"devastating women,\" while other lawmakers held up signs or otherwise displayed their discontent.",
      "Other Democrats conducted acts of protests, with four House Democratic women taking off their pink blazers, stood up, and turned around to reveal black tee shirts with wording on the back \u2014 at least one of them said \"RESIST.\" They then walked out of the chamber.",
      "Several other members also walked out of the chamber.",

Lance Gooden of Texas then snatched it out of her hands and threw the paper into the air. Gooden posted on social media afterward \"No one will disrespect President @realdonaldtrump in front of me.\"",
      "During his speech, Mr. Trump addressed some of the Democrats who protested, saying \"I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.\"",
      "\"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"",

      "Slotkin, 48, was a former CIA officer who worked in national security roles in the Pentagon and both the Bush and Obama administrations and has touted her work across the aisle as a moderate Democrat. During her time as an officer, she served three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military.",
      "In the Obama administration, Slotkin briefed the former president on some of the most sensitive national security issues before she was nominated to serve as the assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon, according to her bio on the Senate website.",
      "Slotkin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 and was reelected in 2020 and 2022. She was mostly known for pledging on the campaign trail to bring her bipartisan approach to the upper chamber. Slotkin said her bipartisan approach comes mostly from living in a household where her father was a Republican and her mother was a Democrat.",
      "\"I believe in bipartisan legislation. It's always better when it's bipartisan,\" Slotkin told CBS News Detroit in a one-on-one interview in October 2024.",
      "\"The idea that I would just be so partisan that I couldn't have Thanksgiving dinner with my dad just doesn't work for me. National security, we're just not trained that way,\" she added.",
      "Within months of longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow announcing that she would not seek reelection, Slotkin\u00a0announced her bid shortly for the seat, becoming the first Democratic candidate to enter the race.\u00a0In the August 2024 primary, Slotkin held a strong lead against actor Hill Harper before taking on Republican Mike Rogers in the general election.",
      "The Slotkin-Rogers race became one of the most watched because Michigan had not elected a Republican in over three decades. Slotkin narrowly beat Rogers in November, resealing the Democratic control over the two U.S. Senate seats.",
      "She received four committee assignments in the Senate: Armed Services, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Agriculture, and Veterans. She was one of four Democrats to win a U.S. Senate race in a state where Mr. Trump won.",
      "Prior to the 2024 election, Slotkin told CBS News Detroit that she was focused on the military and economic threat, particularly from China.",
      "\"I think it's a different type of threat, but because we depend on them, we have a globalized economy; but whether it's their military advantages that they have in some cases or it's the way they have just dominated our supply chains and have a veto on our economic security, to me, it's really important, on a bipartisan basis, for us to come up with thoughtful plans on how to make sure we're prepared militarily if we need it, but also that we take a real serious approach to China investing in things like our farmland, our manufacturing facilities,\" Slotkin said.",

      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",

We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States.

      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",

      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

      "What do people want to hear about?",
      "Inflation. More think it's important for Mr. Trump to talk about his plans for lowering prices than any other item tested. It's the top issue for both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "Inflation is an issue (along with the economy) that a big majority of Americans think should be a high priority for the president but don't think he is prioritizing it a lot.",

      "Who plans to watch the speech?",
      "Mainly Republicans. Mr. Trump's address to Congress will likely have a relatively friendly audience consisting primarily of Republicans. Historically, those in the president's own party have been more inclined to watch an address like this or a State of the Union speech.",
      "In keeping with this, Americans who plan to tune in to tonight's speech are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats or independents. Most of those potential watchers who voted in the 2024 presidential election cast their ballot for Mr. Trump.",
      "(During Joe Biden's presidency, the audience who watched his speeches to a joint Congress had more Democrats than Republicans.)",
      "Three in four of those who say they'll watch the speech approve of the overall job Mr. Trump is doing as president.",

      "Congress and the president",
      "There's still a general view that the president's party in Congress, the Republicans, should push back on the president when they disagree. This includes most of the nation's rank-and-file Republicans who say so.",
      "MAGA Republicans, though, are more likely than Republicans as a whole to say congressional Republicans should do what Mr. Trump wants.",
      "Most Democrats would look for their congressional delegation to oppose Mr. Trump as much as possible.",
      "Americans' views on key issues",
      "Reviewing the tariff issue in the news: Tariffs on countries like Mexico and Canada aren't popular with most Americans (there's more support for tariffs on China), according to polling we did in February, prior to the implementation of the tariffs. One reason: nearly three in four thought new tariffs on imported goods generally would lead to price increases.",
      "This is important because Americans for years have told us that prices are a top reason they don't think the economy is good and told us they don't feel their incomes are keeping up with inflation.",
      "Taxes. Many want to hear the president talk about cutting taxes, and there is majority support for Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, even among more than a third of Democrats.",
      "Deportation policy. During the 2024 campaign most voters \u2014 and overwhelmingly, Trump voters \u2014 supported the idea of his new mass deportation program. Today, a majority of Americans approve of the Trump administration's current deportation policy.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

Roughly 91,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently in private storage, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the U.S. government. And with nearly 20% of the nation's electricity supplied by nuclear energy, plants are generating an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, the Energy Department estimates.",
      "The Supreme Court case",
      "The legal battle before the justices Wednesday involves a license the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued in September 2021 to a company called Interim Storage Partners allowing it to house 5,000 metric tons \u2014 and up to 40,000 metric tons \u2014 of spent fuel in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be constructed in Andrews County, Texas, which is west of Dallas and less than a mile from the state's border with New Mexico. There is already a disposal site in the county for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the site and warning it was dangerous to store nuclear waste anywhere besides a deep geological repository like Yucca Mountain. Texas officials cautioned against housing the spent fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above the state's Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the country's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not seek to intervene in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But several groups did try to object, including Fasken Land and Minerals. Their request, however, was denied by the commission.",
      "Still, the state and land owners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the license to Interim Storage Partners. Two other federal appeals courts considered cases relating to the company's license, but only the 5th Circuit allowed the dispute to move forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit first found that Texas and the landowners could seek review of a final order from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the license because it acted beyond its authority. The court also ruled that provisions of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act do not support licenses like the one issued to Interim Storage Partners, which allows for the offsite storage of spent fuel. Instead, the 5th Circuit also said a 1982 law intends for nuclear waste to be stored at the site of nuclear reactors or in a federal facility until there is a permanent place for it.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October and will consider two issues. The first is whether Texas and the landowners could challenge the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners. The second is whether federal law allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license private companies to temporarily house spent fuel away from nuclear-reactor sites.",
      "In filings with the high court, lawyers for the government argued that Texas didn't become a party to the commission's licensing adjudication simply by submitting comments during proceedings. They also said that Fasken Land and Minerals' unsuccessful attempt to intervene didn't make it a party for the purposes of challenging the commission's decision to grant the license.",
      "If the Supreme Court were to accept the 5th Circuit's finding that Texas and Fasken could seek review of the licensing decision, it would encourage \"litigants to skip the administrative proceeding and then ambush the agency by calling its authority into question once that proceeding is over,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "As to the second question, on whether the commission could grant licenses for temporary, offsite storage, the Justice Department argued that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has exercised that authority for decades.",
      "In 1971, for example, the commission's predecessor issued a license to General Electric Company to store nuclear waste at a standalone facility. In 1989, its Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board recognized when licensing a nuclear power plant that spent fuel could be stored in offsite facilities owned by private entities, government lawyers argued.",
      "\"Storage of spent nuclear fuel lies at the heart of the commission's expertise and congressionally assigned role, and the commission has clear power to issue licenses for temporary storage of spent fuel at the site of a nuclear reactor,\" they wrote.",
      "According to the Congressional Research Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued three licenses for the temporary storage of spent fuel at privately owned facilities away from reactors: The first, issued in 2006 for a project in Utah, was terminated by the license-holder, Private Fuel Storage; the second is to Interim Storage Partners; and the third, granted to Holtec International for the facility in Lea County, New Mexico, is tied up in court proceedings.",
      "But officials for the state of Texas said that Yucca Mountain is the government's plan for dealing with the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste that continue to pile up, and they accused the federal government of engaging in a \"policy workaround\" by licensing private entities to store nuclear waste at facilities away from reactors.",
      "\"Nothing about this license is lawful,\" they wrote in Supreme Court filings. \"Congress has already legislated a solution to the nation's nuclear-waste problem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No statute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim offsite storage.\"",
      "The state invoked what is called the major questions doctrine, which says that Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance.",
      "Congress, Texas officials wrote, has determined that where to store spent nuclear fuel is a major problem of public concern, and the solution is Yucca Mountain. Additionally, Congress mandated that the waste should be stored temporarily at either the reactor site or a facility that is operated by the federal government, the state argued.",
      "\"Congress answered that 'major' question, both as to interim offsite storage and permanent disposal,\" lawyers for Texas wrote. \"Congress's clear answer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal facilities \u2014 not a private facility in Texas.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Office of Personnel Management issued revised guidance to federal agencies Tuesday regarding the firing of probationary workers amid President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the government, informing department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding those employees.",
      "The revised memo from Charles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, comes after a federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary workers, who generally have been in their jobs for less than one year, were likely illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that \"OPM did not have the authority to direct the firing of employees, probationary or otherwise, in any other federal agency.\"",
      "The latest guidance from OPM revises a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell that required agencies to identify all employees still in their probationary periods and send a report to the agency listing all those workers. The memo instructed department heads to \"promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"",
      "But the revised memo includes a new paragraph that states that \"by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "OPM said it \"wanted to clarify in light of a recent court order and some public misinformation. It has always been up to agencies whether to take performance-based actions against probationary employees.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, said OPM's latest guidance \"is a clear admission that it unlawfully directed federal agencies to carry out mass terminations of probational employees.\"",
      "\"Every agency should immediately rescind these unlawful terminations and reinstate everyone who was illegally fired,\" Kelley said in a statement regarding the memo.",
      "The AFGE is one of the labor unions that sued the Trump administration over its firings of tens of thousands of federal workers. The unions estimated there were roughly 200,000 probationary workers employed throughout the federal government. The federal workforce consists of more than 2.4 million people, excluding military personnel and postal workers.",
      "After Ezell directed agency heads to identify probationary employees, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that instructed agency heads to \"promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The mass firings were a drastic move by Mr. Trump in his effort to cut the size of the federal government. The president established the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to lead the efforts to shrink the government, and workers for the task force has fanned out across federal agencies. OPM also gave federal workers the option to participate in a deferred resignation program, which gave them the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "The Trump administration has also targeted specific agencies, namely the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, in its cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Trump's overhaul of the agencies, though, is being challenged in federal court."

      "A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday made it harder for environmental regulators to limit water pollution, ruling for San Francisco in a case about the discharge of raw sewage that sometimes occurs during heavy rains.",
      "By a 5-4 vote, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority under the Clean Water Act with water pollution permits that contain vague requirements for maintaining water quality.",
      "The decision is the latest in which conservative justices have reined in pollution control efforts.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that the EPA can set specific limits that tell cities and counties what can be discharged. But the agency lacks the authority \"to include 'end-result' provisions,\" Alito wrote, that make cities and counties responsible for maintaining the quality of the water, the Pacific Ocean in this case, into which wastewater is discharged.",
      "\"When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,\" he wrote.",
      "One conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, joined the court's three liberals in dissent. Limits on discharges sometimes still don't insure water quality standards are met, Barrett wrote.",
      "\"The concern that the technology-based effluent limitations may fall short is on display in this case,\" Barrett wrote, adding that \"discharges from components of San Francisco's sewer system have allegedly led to serious breaches of the water quality standards, such as 'discoloration, scum, and floating material, including toilet paper, in Mission Creek.'\"",
      "The case produced an unusual alliance of the liberal northern California city, energy companies and business groups.",
      "The EPA has issued thousands of the permits, known as narrative permits, over several decades, former acting general counsel Kevin Minoli said.",
      "The narrative permits have operated almost as a backstop in case permits that quantify what can be discharged still result in unacceptable water quality, Minoli said.",
      "With the new restrictions imposed by the court, \"the question is what comes in place of those limits,\" Minoli said.",
      "Alito downplayed the impact of the decision, writing that the agency has \"the tools needed\" to insure water quality standards are met.",
      "In response to the decision, the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organization headquartered in Oakland, California, released a statement.",
      "The decision \"ignores the basic reality of how water bodies and water pollution works, and could stymie the ability of the EPA to implement the Clean Water Act, a bedrock environmental law that has kept water safe for the last 50 years,\" Sanjay Narayan, chief appellate counsel at the Sierra Club's environmental law program, said.",
      "\"Because the EPA is not allowed to include health-based standards when regulating water pollution, it'll need to know everything about what might be discharged before a clean-water permit can be issued \u2014 making the permitting process delayed and incredibly expensive,\" Narayan said. \"The result is likely to be a new system where the public is regularly subjected to unsafe water quality.\"",
      "San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu and San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager Dennis Herrera said in a statement that the decision \"makes clear that permitholders like San Francisco are responsible for what they discharge, and the EPA has the tools at its disposal to ensure water quality. But it's not lawful to punish permitholders for things outside of their control, such as the end-result water quality of a shared body of water, where many other factors affect water quality.\"",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",

      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",

    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",
      "\"Knowing where the air is really moving tells you a lot about what your vehicle is doing, how efficient it is, and how you can make it better,\" Ed Haering, principal investigator for the Schlieren photography, said in a 2023 NASA news release.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",

      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",

      "While the CDC\u00a0says\u00a0those estimates are not nationally representative, other estimates from the National Survey of Children's Health show similar trends. The rise in estimates, however, may not stem from an increase in cases, according to the CDC.",

      "In February, Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 migrant apprehensions between official points of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, the statistics show.",
      "The total, which may still be adjusted when the data are published, would mark the lowest monthly apprehensions since fiscal year 2000, the earliest period with\u00a0publicly available monthly data. While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to\u00a0historical statistics.",

Al Green of Texas stood and shouted in protest when Mr. Trump began touting his victory in the 2024 election. Green was quickly escorted from the House chamber.",
      "Who is Al Green?",
      "Green, 77, has represented a Houston, Texas, district in the House since 2005.",
      "The Texas Democrat has previously pushed to remove Mr. Trump from office, authoring articles of impeachment against him during the president's first term. He threatened to do so again last month after the president suggested the U.S. would take over Gaza.",
      "Why was Congressman Green escorted out of Trump's joint address?",
      "After Mr. Trump kicked off his speech declaring that \"America is back,\" to applause and chants of \"USA\" from Republicans, he celebrated his victory in the 2024 election, saying \"the presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\"",

      "As Green continued, Johnson repeatedly urged him to take his seat, before directing the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "After he was removed from the chamber, Green told reporters that he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"Whatever the punishment is,\" Green said. \"I'm not fighting the punishment. This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor.\"",
      "Have other Democrats protested during Trump's speech?",
      "Green's interruption came after questions swirled about how Democrats would conduct themselves during Mr. Trump's address. A group of House Democratic women wore pink Tuesday night to protest how they say the president's policies are \"devastating women,\" while other lawmakers held up signs or otherwise displayed their discontent.",
      "Other Democrats conducted acts of protests, with four House Democratic women taking off their pink blazers, stood up, and turned around to reveal black tee shirts with wording on the back \u2014 at least one of them said \"RESIST.\" They then walked out of the chamber.",
      "Several other members also walked out of the chamber.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, meanwhile, displayed a white board that said \"start by paying your taxes\" when Mr. Trump asked Congress to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to sunset at the end of 2025.",
      "Another Democrat, Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, held a sign that said \"this is not normal\" while Mr. Trump walked out. Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas then snatched it out of her hands and threw the paper into the air. Gooden posted on social media afterward \"No one will disrespect President @realdonaldtrump in front of me.\"",
      "During his speech, Mr. Trump addressed some of the Democrats who protested, saying \"I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.\"",
      "\"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"",
      "A small number of Democrats opted not to attend Tuesday night's address, including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Democrats didn't stage a large-scale boycott of the speech.",

    "summary": "Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate two key ports in Panama to BlackRock consortium.",
    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

    "story": [
      "Stacy Ramsey and Leah Saffian worked at the Buffalo National River, part of Arkansas' Ozark National Forest, until they were among about 1,000 National Park Service workers who were laid off last month as part of the Trump administration's wave of federal mass firings.",
      "\"I actually worked seven days a week for a few weeks just to get my foot in the door,\" said Ramsey, who worked as a river ranger before being let go.",
      "Saffian had 10 days to move and start her new job as a campground manager for the park service. She took out a loan to purchase a $16,000 camper she could use as a residence.",
      "But she was let go about three weeks into the job.",
      "\"I feel very disrespected,\" Saffian told CBS News. \"\u2026I cycle through being angry, sad, distressed.\"",
      "Since President Trump took office, thousands of federal workers have been fired by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is headed up by billionaire Elon Musk, as part of the new administration's efforts to enact major budget cuts. The layoffs at the park service amounted to about 5% of the agency's workforce of approximately 20,000 employees.",
      "Park service jobs can range from collecting entrance fees to cleaning up trash to conducting search-and-rescue missions. The agency oversees more than 85 million acres across the U.S., such as the Buffalo National River.",
      "\"It's one of the only places I can go to and just kind of completely forget everything that's going on and just have a sense of peace when you're here,\" Ramsey said of the river.",
      "Ramsey worked along the Buffalo National River as its only permanent river ranger, saving dozens of hikers and boaters on search and rescue missions.",
      "\"This is, like, home to me for sure,\" Ramsey said.",
      "Losing the job to her is more than just losing a dream or the income it brought. Every eight weeks to manage her Crohn's disease, Stacy has given herself a shot that, without health insurance, would cost $27,500, almost her entire annual salary with the park service.",
      "With health insurance, the shot was $5. But her health insurance expires in less than 30 days, and without the shot, she says she could end up in the hospital.",
      "\"These thousands of employees terminated are all real people,\" Ramsey said. \"They're all people who have families, who have mortgages, utility bills, bills to pay.\"",
      "For both Ramsey and Saffian, finding a job with benefits will be harder because they moved to the remote Ozarks.",
      "\"I'm not going to, you know, live my life at the end of a string,\" Saffian said. \"I have to come up with another plan to make this work.\"",
      "They are left wondering if their sacrifices paid off. Ramsey says she is still keeping her park service uniforms \"just in case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Looking ahead to President Trump's address to Congress, here's what's on Americans' minds and what they want to hear from the president, with context from recent CBS News polling.",
      "What do people want to hear about?",
      "Inflation. More think it's important for Mr. Trump to talk about his plans for lowering prices than any other item tested. It's the top issue for both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "Inflation is an issue (along with the economy) that a big majority of Americans think should be a high priority for the president but don't think he is prioritizing it a lot.",
      "Seventy-seven percent of Americans say their incomes are not keeping up with inflation.",
      "Many also want to hear about plans for Medicare and Medicaid, the federal budget and cutting taxes.",
      "Americans are less likely to think it's important to hear the president talk about things like reductions in the federal workforce, what Congress should do, and the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Who plans to watch the speech?",
      "Mainly Republicans. Mr. Trump's address to Congress will likely have a relatively friendly audience consisting primarily of Republicans. Historically, those in the president's own party have been more inclined to watch an address like this or a State of the Union speech.",
      "In keeping with this, Americans who plan to tune in to tonight's speech are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats or independents. Most of those potential watchers who voted in the 2024 presidential election cast their ballot for Mr. Trump.",
      "(During Joe Biden's presidency, the audience who watched his speeches to a joint Congress had more Democrats than Republicans.)",
      "Three in four of those who say they'll watch the speech approve of the overall job Mr. Trump is doing as president.",
      "We gave people a list of things the government funds. None of them registered a majority wanting cuts, except foreign aid.",
      "While many Americans think cutting government spending in principle should be a high priority, most do not want cuts to federal spending on Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education, defense, or border enforcement. This is also true among Republicans.",
      "Congress and the president",
      "There's still a general view that the president's party in Congress, the Republicans, should push back on the president when they disagree. This includes most of the nation's rank-and-file Republicans who say so.",
      "MAGA Republicans, though, are more likely than Republicans as a whole to say congressional Republicans should do what Mr. Trump wants.",
      "Most Democrats would look for their congressional delegation to oppose Mr. Trump as much as possible.",
      "Americans' views on key issues",
      "Reviewing the tariff issue in the news: Tariffs on countries like Mexico and Canada aren't popular with most Americans (there's more support for tariffs on China), according to polling we did in February, prior to the implementation of the tariffs. One reason: nearly three in four thought new tariffs on imported goods generally would lead to price increases.",
      "This is important because Americans for years have told us that prices are a top reason they don't think the economy is good and told us they don't feel their incomes are keeping up with inflation.",
      "Taxes. Many want to hear the president talk about cutting taxes, and there is majority support for Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, even among more than a third of Democrats.",
      "Deportation policy. During the 2024 campaign most voters \u2014 and overwhelmingly, Trump voters \u2014 supported the idea of his new mass deportation program. Today, a majority of Americans approve of the Trump administration's current deportation policy.",
      "Russia-Ukraine. Prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the pause in U.S. aid to Ukraine, the country continued to divide along partisan lines over military aid to Ukraine.",
      "This analysis is based on CBS News/YouGov surveys conducted with nationally representative samples of U.S. adults.

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider a dispute over the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's license allowing thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste to be stored in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will convene Wednesday to weigh in on a decades-long dispute over what to do with thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste, specifically a plan to store it above one of the world's most productive oil fields, the Permian Basin in Texas.",
      "The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the company Interim Storage Partners are facing off against the state of Texas and Fasken Land and Minerals Ltd., which owns land in the Permian Basin, in the fight over what to do with the spent fuel generated at nuclear reactor sites. The waste can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress\u00a0 enacted a federal law that required the government to establish a permanent facility to house spent fuel, later determined to be Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the site has yet to be established amid pushback from the state, and funding from Congress dried up years ago. The project was halted during the Obama administration.",
      "The issue of where to store the growing amount of spent fuel remains. Roughly 91,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently in private storage, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the U.S. government. And with nearly 20% of the nation's electricity supplied by nuclear energy, plants are generating an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, the Energy Department estimates.",
      "The Supreme Court case",
      "The legal battle before the justices Wednesday involves a license the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued in September 2021 to a company called Interim Storage Partners allowing it to house 5,000 metric tons \u2014 and up to 40,000 metric tons \u2014 of spent fuel in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be constructed in Andrews County, Texas, which is west of Dallas and less than a mile from the state's border with New Mexico. There is already a disposal site in the county for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the site and warning it was dangerous to store nuclear waste anywhere besides a deep geological repository like Yucca Mountain. Texas officials cautioned against housing the spent fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above the state's Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the country's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not seek to intervene in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But several groups did try to object, including Fasken Land and Minerals. Their request, however, was denied by the commission.",
      "Still, the state and land owners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the license to Interim Storage Partners. Two other federal appeals courts considered cases relating to the company's license, but only the 5th Circuit allowed the dispute to move forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit first found that Texas and the landowners could seek review of a final order from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the license because it acted beyond its authority. The court also ruled that provisions of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act do not support licenses like the one issued to Interim Storage Partners, which allows for the offsite storage of spent fuel. Instead, the 5th Circuit also said a 1982 law intends for nuclear waste to be stored at the site of nuclear reactors or in a federal facility until there is a permanent place for it.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October and will consider two issues. The first is whether Texas and the landowners could challenge the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners. The second is whether federal law allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license private companies to temporarily house spent fuel away from nuclear-reactor sites.",
      "In filings with the high court, lawyers for the government argued that Texas didn't become a party to the commission's licensing adjudication simply by submitting comments during proceedings. They also said that Fasken Land and Minerals' unsuccessful attempt to intervene didn't make it a party for the purposes of challenging the commission's decision to grant the license.",
      "If the Supreme Court were to accept the 5th Circuit's finding that Texas and Fasken could seek review of the licensing decision, it would encourage \"litigants to skip the administrative proceeding and then ambush the agency by calling its authority into question once that proceeding is over,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "As to the second question, on whether the commission could grant licenses for temporary, offsite storage, the Justice Department argued that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has exercised that authority for decades.",
      "In 1971, for example, the commission's predecessor issued a license to General Electric Company to store nuclear waste at a standalone facility. In 1989, its Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board recognized when licensing a nuclear power plant that spent fuel could be stored in offsite facilities owned by private entities, government lawyers argued.",
      "\"Storage of spent nuclear fuel lies at the heart of the commission's expertise and congressionally assigned role, and the commission has clear power to issue licenses for temporary storage of spent fuel at the site of a nuclear reactor,\" they wrote.",
      "According to the Congressional Research Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued three licenses for the temporary storage of spent fuel at privately owned facilities away from reactors: The first, issued in 2006 for a project in Utah, was terminated by the license-holder, Private Fuel Storage; the second is to Interim Storage Partners; and the third, granted to Holtec International for the facility in Lea County, New Mexico, is tied up in court proceedings.",
      "But officials for the state of Texas said that Yucca Mountain is the government's plan for dealing with the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste that continue to pile up, and they accused the federal government of engaging in a \"policy workaround\" by licensing private entities to store nuclear waste at facilities away from reactors.",
      "\"Nothing about this license is lawful,\" they wrote in Supreme Court filings. \"Congress has already legislated a solution to the nation's nuclear-waste problem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No statute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim offsite storage.\"",
      "The state invoked what is called the major questions doctrine, which says that Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance.",
      "Congress, Texas officials wrote, has determined that where to store spent nuclear fuel is a major problem of public concern, and the solution is Yucca Mountain. Additionally, Congress mandated that the waste should be stored temporarily at either the reactor site or a facility that is operated by the federal government, the state argued.",
      "\"Congress answered that 'major' question, both as to interim offsite storage and permanent disposal,\" lawyers for Texas wrote. \"Congress's clear answer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal facilities \u2014 not a private facility in Texas.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Office of Personnel Management issued revised guidance to federal agencies Tuesday regarding the firing of probationary workers amid President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the government, informing department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding those employees.",
      "The revised memo from Charles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, comes after a federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary workers, who generally have been in their jobs for less than one year, were likely illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that \"OPM did not have the authority to direct the firing of employees, probationary or otherwise, in any other federal agency.\"",
      "The latest guidance from OPM revises a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell that required agencies to identify all employees still in their probationary periods and send a report to the agency listing all those workers. The memo instructed department heads to \"promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"",
      "But the revised memo includes a new paragraph that states that \"by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "OPM said it \"wanted to clarify in light of a recent court order and some public misinformation. It has always been up to agencies whether to take performance-based actions against probationary employees.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, said OPM's latest guidance \"is a clear admission that it unlawfully directed federal agencies to carry out mass terminations of probational employees.\"",
      "\"Every agency should immediately rescind these unlawful terminations and reinstate everyone who was illegally fired,\" Kelley said in a statement regarding the memo.",
      "The AFGE is one of the labor unions that sued the Trump administration over its firings of tens of thousands of federal workers. The unions estimated there were roughly 200,000 probationary workers employed throughout the federal government. The federal workforce consists of more than 2.4 million people, excluding military personnel and postal workers.",
      "After Ezell directed agency heads to identify probationary employees, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that instructed agency heads to \"promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The mass firings were a drastic move by Mr. Trump in his effort to cut the size of the federal government. The president established the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to lead the efforts to shrink the government, and workers for the task force has fanned out across federal agencies. OPM also gave federal workers the option to participate in a deferred resignation program, which gave them the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "The Trump administration has also targeted specific agencies, namely the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, in its cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Trump's overhaul of the agencies, though, is being challenged in federal court."

      "No one was badly hurt when the 11-foot\u00a0bottlenose dolphin jumped aboard the open-top boat Friday, said Dean Harrison, the owner of the nearly 16-foot vessel.",
      "Harrison and two companions were fishing near the Hole in the Rock, a picturesque spot off the far north coast of New Zealand's North Island, while dolphins frolicked ahead. The men saw a shadow across the bright summer sun and heard an almighty boom \u2014 before chaos unfolded.",
      "\"This one decided to jump on board and say hello,\" Harrison said. \"One minute everything was fine and then just like lightning striking, there's a big dolphin in our boat thrashing around and breaking everything.\"",
      "The creature's flailing snapped \"every single fishing rod we had in the boat\" and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\"We looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we've got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\" Harrison said. \"Because he's stuck in the boat for now, so he's coming along for the ride.\"",
      "The men alerted New Zealand's conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2- 3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \"sign\" in the M\u0101ori language.",

      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",

And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",

That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",

      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",

      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:35:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Other than Pope Francis, these are the most powerful people at the Vatican.",
    "story": [
      "For more than two weeks, eyes have been on the Vatican, awaiting news about Pope Francis' health. The pope has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14, 2025, being treated for double pneumonia and other complications.",
      "When a pope is ill, resigns or passes away, who steps in? And who else helps lead the Holy See? The Conversation U.S. asked Daniel Speed Thompson, a theologian at the University of Dayton, for some insight into Vatican City.",
      "Who are the most powerful people at the Vatican, besides the pope?",
      "The Vatican houses the central government of the Catholic Church and is also an independent city-state. The pope is both the head of the Catholic Church and head of state.",
      "In order to govern both, he has the Roman Curia, meaning \"court.\" In modern terms, the Curia is the papal bureaucracy. It is an extension of the pope's authority.",
      "In Catholic doctrine, the pope has the highest authority in the church. He can exercise it alone or with the College of Bishops, made up of all the bishops in the world. Bishops named by the pope to the office of \"cardinal\" can, if under 80 years old, vote to elect a new pope. Some cardinals, but by no means all, serve in the papal Curia in Rome.",
      "Besides the pope, curial officials who oversee important aspects of the church's political and religious life are often powerful figures. For example, the secretariat of state, headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, oversees relations with other countries and international organizations. It also oversees the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "The Dicastery \u2014 \"department\" \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, addresses questions about correct Catholic teaching on faith and morals. The Dicastery of Bishops, headed by Cardinal Robert Prevost, coordinates the nominations of new bishops around the world.",
      "All these officials work under the authority of the pope, advocating for and implementing his agenda. For example, Prevost has suggested that all Catholics should be involved in the selection of bishops. This idea is linked with Francis' call for a more \"synodal\" church: one that is less hierarchical and shaped by lay Catholics' concerns and challenges.",
      "If a pope can't fulfill his duties, who steps in?",
      "When a pope dies \u2013 or resigns, like Benedict XVI did in 2013 \u2014 the governance of the Catholic Church formally falls to the College of Cardinals. However, the authority of the college is very limited. On their own, cardinals cannot make any significant decisions concerning faith, morals and worship. Nor can they undo previous papal decisions or change church laws about electing a new pope.",
      "All the heads of the dicasteries lose their office upon the death or resignation of a pope. The College of Cardinals serves as a caretaker government whose primary purpose is to prepare for the election of the new pope and oversee day-to-day workings of the Vatican.",
      "One cardinal, known as the \"camerlengo,\" is responsible for confirming the pope's death or resignation. He then assumes control over the pope's residence and coordinates the funeral, if needed. The camerlengo also takes custody of the Vatican's property in Rome and supervises details for the upcoming conclave.",
      "The day-to-day business of the Catholic Church continues, but no big decisions can be made in the absence of a pope. The church cannot appoint new bishops, and the Vatican cannot start new diplomatic efforts.",
      "Are officials at the Vatican often nominated to be pope?",
      "Sometimes. Francis was a cardinal from Argentina before his election as pope and had not served in the Roman Curia. However, Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, did serve as the prefect of the Congregation \u2014 now called Dicastery \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith. Some recent popes served in the Curia earlier in their career but not immediately before their election.",
      "What do you wish more people understood about the Vatican?",
      "Three things. First, the Vatican is unlike any organization in the world. Its religious mission and political status rest on nearly 2,000 years of history. This complicated story provides a unique tradition that anchors the institution of the Catholic Church, but can also block the church from critical self-examination and renewal.",
      "Second, the Vatican is like every organization in the world. Vatican officials can be faithful to the highest standards of their religion, truly wishing to serve the church and the common good of humanity. But they can also be flagrantly immoral, even criminals, and careerist seekers of status or luxury. Francis has consistently called out priests and bishops who see themselves as somehow superior by virtue of their office or their ordination.",
      "Finally, compared with the massive bureaucracies of modern governments and corporations, the Vatican is relatively small and not as wealthy as it is often portrayed.",
      "Although the Curia manages a vast international organization, its resources are far closer to my own midsize Catholic university than to the U.S. government or Apple. Vatican City and the Holy See employ about 2,000 people, with an operating budget of about $835 million.",
      "Yes, the Catholic Church has wealth \u2014 and the ongoing problem of deficits and financial corruption. But the Vatican's resources pale in comparison with what a modern state or large company can muster.",

      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that his country was \"ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible\" to work out a peace deal to end the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian leader also said it was \"time to make things right\" with the United States after a bruising Oval Office meeting with President Trump and the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy said in a lengthy post on social media. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.\"",
      "Ukraine's president then outlined possible first stages for a ceasefire deal, which appeared to echo a European proposal floated by French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend.

    "summary": "The iceberg A23a has run aground in the shallow waters off of South Georgia, a remote British territory in the Southern Atlantic, researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "The world's\u00a0largest and oldest iceberg, named A23a, has run aground in shallow waters off the coast of South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic known for its populations of penguins and elephant seals.",
      "The \"mega-berg,\" as some call it, is a sprawling ice sheet that once covered around 1,500 square miles but on its journey northward from Antarctica lost about 200 square miles of mass. Either way, the near-trillion-ton giant is larger than the state of Rhode Island, with towering cliffs that at certain points top 1,300 feet. It cracked off from continental Antarctica in 1986 and got stuck in the Weddell Sea, where it remained grounded for about three decades, according to the British Antarctic Survey, a research group focusing on polar science. The group has a station in South Georgia, which is a British territory.",
      "The iceberg looks like a \"towering wall emerging from the ocean, stretching from horizon to horizon,\" said British Antarctic Survey oceanographer Andrew Meijers in remarks published by the research group. Meijers studied A23a while aboard the ship RSS David Attenborough in late 2023.",
      "A23a started to drift up through the Southern Ocean in 2020, when currents put it on a possible collision course with South Georgia. The iceberg and the island are about the same size in square miles. Researchers describe its path toward South Georgia as both meandering and intriguing, as the iceberg has charted a somewhat unexpected route to the island and became trapped last year in a rotating column of water that for months left it spinning in place.",
      "At this point, the iceberg appears to be grounded in the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia, settling roughly 50 miles from the island's southwestern coast, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Meijers, citing satellite images, said it seems to be intact right now. But the iceberg will likely break into smaller chunks and begin to melt shortly afterward, in a process that could interrupt shipping operations and disrupt fisheries in the surrounding region.",
      "\"Whilst the berg is large it is easily avoided by Southern Ocean shipping operators \u2014 who are well aware of the dangers bergs pose, and the location of A23a. However, as it breaks up over time, the smaller bergs are much harder to track,\" Meijers said. \"Discussions with fishing operators suggests that past large bergs have made some regions more or less off limits for fishing operations for some time due to the number of smaller \u2014 yet often more dangerous \u2014 bergy bits.\"",
      "Meijers said there's less of a concern about the effects A23a could have on South Georgia's seals and penguins, although huge chunks of ice in the island's vicinity could possibly thwart their paths to feeding sites and result in less food and higher mortality rates for pups and chicks relying on them.",
      "But the melting iceberg may also bring positive changes to the environment, Meijers added, by dispensing huge amounts of nutrients into the water that, in turn, \"could actually boost populations of local predators like seals and penguins.\"",
      "While Meijers noted icebergs like A23a are normal parts of the Antarctic life cycle, human-caused climate change has accelerated the process over the last couple of decades. Since 2000, researchers have recorded ice shelves losing about 6,000 gigatons of their mass, he said. One gigaton is equal to 1 billion metric tons, or 2.2 trillion pounds.",
      "\"This loss of ice shelf mass has significant implications for ocean circulation due to the addition of freshwater, acceleration of sea level rise ... and possible irreversible 'tipping points,' particularly in the vulnerable west Antarctic,\" Meijers said.\u202f\"These are pressing and active areas of research at BAS and elsewhere.\"",

      "One way it would do this is by allowing EU countries to spend more on defense without triggering EU mechanisms against budget deficits, Von der Leyen said. Another way would be through EU loans worth around $158 billion for EU member states.",
      "\"It will help Member States to pool demand and to buy together,\" Von der Leyen said. \"With this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine\u2026 This approach of joint procurement will also reduce costs, reduce fragmentation, increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.\"",

      "Wronski told journalists Mr. Trump had made the decision, \"without informing, nor consulting\" his NATO allies, adding: \"It is a very important decision and the situation is very serious.\"",
      "Ireland's leader Michael Martin called the move by Mr. Trump a \"serious setback\" to achieving peace, stressing that Ukrainians, \"have shown extraordinary resilience, extraordinary courage in terms of meeting an illegal invasion.\"",
      "\"Europe is very conscious, also, of the fact that there are many other states across Europe who fear Russian aggression and Russian ambition, and those countries see this as an existential threat to their sovereignty,\" Martin said. \"The European Union is very, very conscious of that, and that is what is motivating the European Union in its continued strong support of Ukraine, because this is a broader European issue.\"",
      "The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said Europe \"cannot allow Russia's aggressive policy, which threatens us all, to succeed. The era of relying on others to address fundamental international challenges on our behalf is over. Now is the time for Europe to move decisively from words to action.\"",
      "Will Trump's move \"encourage Putin to ask for more\"?",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to suspend U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"will encourage Putin to ask for more \u2014 including Ukrainian demilitarization and neutrality,\" Malcolm Chalmers, Deputy Director-General of the Royal United Services Institute military think tank, predicted Tuesday.",
      "Chalmers said the \"nightmare scenario\" would be for the United States and Russia to announce a peace deal, \"and then tell Ukraine and Europe to 'take it or leave it.'\"",
      "Recent estimates show only about 20% of military hardware supplied to Ukraine is from the United States, with 25% provided by Europe and the rest of the world and 55% produced in Ukraine, Chalmers said. But the 20% provided by the U.S., he said, is \"the most lethal and important.\"",
      "\"What will count most of all is how far the U.K. and Europe are prepared to help Ukraine in defiance of the U.S.,\" Chalmers said. \"Ukraine will not collapse [without U.S. military aid] \u2013 they already experienced an aid cutoff last year, but the effect will be cumulative.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced on Monday a pause in the provision of billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine \u2014 aid that had been promised by former President Biden before he left office. It will affect deliveries of ammunition and other vital supplies as Ukraine fights to defend itself from Russia's ongoing, three-year full-scale invasion that has seen President Vladimir Putin's forces occupy roughly 20% of eastern Ukraine.",
      "The aid pause came after Friday's contentious Oval Office meeting that descended into an unprecedented televised spectacle as President Trump and Vice President JD Vance belittled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of failing to express sufficient gratitude and disrespecting the U.S. presidency.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News on Monday. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "That reaction by Mr. Trump is a nightmare scenario for Ukraine, and it could have real consequences not only for Zelenskyy's forces on the ground, but for all of Europe. It was a dramatic ratcheting up of Mr. Trump's campaign to pile pressure on Zelenskyy to pursue a peace deal with Putin \u2014 but on terms that Ukraine has so far deemed untenable, with no offer of a U.S. guarantee to protect Ukraine from future attacks by its much larger, authoritarian neighbor.",
      "The announcement was met with immediate trepidation in Ukraine, but quickly welcomed by Moscow, where Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it \"a decision that could actually push the Kyiv regime toward a peace process.\"",
      "\"It is obvious that, until now, the U.S. has been the main supplier of this war,\" Peskov said. \"If the U.S. stops that or suspends these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to [achieving] peace.\"",

      "\"What I can say for sure is that Ukraine will still fight. But I will ask you a question,\" he told CBS News. \"Would [the U.S.] be okay to stay on the sidelines when we need to stop Russian aggression? And what does Russia want to do? It wants to destroy the world that was built by previous American administrations.\"",
      "It's a world President Trump has never signaled clearly that he is willing to defend. But Ukrainian soldiers wounded on the battlefield told CBS News in a military trauma ward in Kyiv, that they are.",
      "Oleksiy, a grandfather and volunteer soldier in his 50s, was being treated for shrapnel wounds to his legs and hips from Russian shelling. He also suffered a war wound to his arm a year ago, but he went back to fight.",
      "\"Of course,\" he said, when asked if he would continue fighting when he healed, with or without support from Washington. \"For the sake of my granddaughter.\"",
      "As Ukrainian leaders consider what to do next, they will have to turn increasingly to their partners in Europe, who already provide just over 50% of the military assistance Ukraine receives. European leaders have vowed in recent days to step up that support \u2014 dramatically \u2014 as Russia's assault rages on.",
      "Highlighting the importance of that support, Russian forces launched nearly 100 explosive drones at the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Odessa overnight.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News the country could sustain itself militarily for up to six months without further U.S. military aid, but that would be dependent on the severity of Russian attacks.",
      "Ukraine's president has warned for years, even before Russia launched its full-scale invasion after insisting for months that it had no intention of doing so, that if Putin is not stopped in his tracks, he will keep pushing to claw back more of the territory Russia lost when the Soviet Union collapsed \u2014 and the Russian autocrat has made no secret about his perception of both NATO and Europe as hostile entities.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops\u00a0three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.",
      "Friday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",
      "Delegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"",

    "summary": "Ukraine's president, after his clash with President Trump, says he's still open to a possible minerals deal, but his country still needs security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country felt the full support of its European allies after a summit in London over the weekend, as he reiterated the need for Western security guarantees as part of any agreement to secure a lasting end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of his country three years ago. Ukraine fears Russia would renege on any peace deal that doesn't carry with it the threat that Ukraine's partners would come to its aid in case of a violation.",
      "\"For peace to be real, we need real security guarantees. And this is the position of all of Europe \u2013 the entire continent,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post Monday, three days after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" and failing to offer thanks during a contentious Oval Office meeting with news cameras rolling.",
      "\"Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we've received from the United States,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"There has not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude. It's gratitude for the preservation of our independence \u2013 our resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us \u2013 and for their own security. What we need is peace, not endless war. And that's why we say security guarantees are the key to this.\"",
      "The Sunday summit of European leaders organized by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was already scheduled before the tense meeting in Washington between Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump, but it took on new meaning in the wake of the exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward Ukraine's wartime president compounded existing concerns among European leaders about the current American administration's commitment to ensuring not only Ukraine's independence going forward, but European security in general as the continent faces an increasingly aggressive Russian state run by authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",
      "After the summit on Sunday, Zelenskyy gave a briefing in Ukrainian in which he said he believed a peace deal with Russia \"is still very, very far away,\" but that Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. would remain strong.",
      "\"I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it's more than an occasional relationship,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion. His comments were covered by the Associated Press.",
      "Later on Monday, Mr. Trump posted a link to the AP's story covering Zelenskyy's comments and criticized the Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Mr. Trump said. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "What came out of the London summit?",
      "Starmer said Monday that there were \"a number of options on the table\" for possible peace plans to end the war Russia started, all of which were developed alongside Ukraine, but he said he didn't want to get \"into a running commentary on the options.\"",
      "\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease. Instead, any deal must be backed by strength.\"",
      "Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told local media one possible plan would involve a monthlong ceasefire, but covering only the air, sea and energy infrastructure, not the ongoing and deadly ground fighting.",
      "After the summit, Starmer announced four key points that he said had been agreed to by the European leaders:",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on RussiaThat Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and securityTo boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the warTo create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",

      "To create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "Starmer also announced a new agreement that will enable Ukraine to obtain about $2 billion worth of missiles made in Northern Ireland to continue its war effort.",
      "Ripple effects from White House meeting still being felt",
      "Russia has lauded Mr. Trump in the wake of his clash with Zelenskyy, which came after a week that saw the U.S. leader echo false talking points Moscow has pushed since it launched its full-scale invasion, including the assertion that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",
      "\"We'd certainly like to see that happen,\" Waltz said.",
      "Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" and he accused Zelenskyy of having \"thrown off the sequencing\" of the deals by trying \"to relitigate in front of the world\" in the Oval Office.",
      "But some European leaders disagreed with that interpretation of events.",
      "\"My assessment is that it wasn't a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\" Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany's next leader, said Monday. \"We must now show that we are in a position to act independently in Europe.\"",

      "The Georgia House unanimously passed a bill on Tuesday lessening the threshold for a person facing the death penalty to be considered intellectually disabled, which would make them ineligible for a death sentence.",
      "State Rep. Bill Werkheiser, a Republican, had previously introduced legislation aimed at making it easier for someone to prove they are intellectually disabled in order to avoid the death penalty in the Peach State, which has one of the nation's toughest thresholds to overcome.",
      "That bill was proposed just months before Willie James Pye, whose IQ was allegedly low enough to show he was intellectually disabled, was executed after his conviction in the 1993 rape and shooting death of his former girlfriend, Alicia Lynn Yarbrough. Pye's lawyers argued he was intellectually disabled and brain-damaged.",

      "SOUTH CAROLINA DEATH ROW INMATE CHOOSES FIRING SQUAD AS EXECUTION METHOD",
      "Georgia GOP Rep. Bill Werkheiser said he thinks it is \"incumbent\" that the state \"protect those who cannot protect themselves.\" (AP)",
      "Georgia became the first state to outlaw the death penalty for intellectually disabled people in 1988. The U.S. Supreme Court later followed suit and ruled in 2002 that executing intellectually disabled people violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "However, the court allowed states to determine the threshold for a person to be considered intellectually disabled. Georgia requires people to prove intellectual disability beyond a reasonable doubt, making it the only state with such a high burden of proof.",
      "The bill advanced on Tuesday also allows defendants to present evidence of intellectual disability at a pretrial hearing that would be mandatory if prosecutors agree. If convicted at trial, defendants could then present evidence of intellectual disability in a separate process before the same jury.",
      "Defendants who are found to have an intellectual disability would receive a life sentence if convicted.",
      "\"I believe it is incumbent upon the state to protect those who cannot protect themselves,\" Werkheiser said.",
      "In another case, Warren Lee Hill was executed in Georgia in 2015 for killing a fellow detainee despite his lawyers arguing that he had an intellectual disability. In 2002, a judge said that if Georgia used a lower standard than reasonable doubt, Hill would likely have been found intellectually disabled.",

      "When the Georgia Supreme Court in 2021 upheld the death penalty for Rodney Young, the justices found he had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was intellectually disabled, although then-Presiding Justice David Nahmias wrote that he would \"embrace\" legislative efforts to lower the threshold.",
      "Young was sentenced to death in the 2008 killing of Gary Jones, his ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2019s adult son.",
      "Prosecutors have testified in committee hearings that they do not oppose amending the reasonable doubt standard, but they are against changes to the trial process and the addition of a pretrial hearing.",
      "\"The proposed bill cherry-picks from several different states,\" said T. Wright Barksdale III, district attorney for the Ocmulgee Judicial Circuit in central Georgia.",
      "Proponents of the bill argue that if jurors have already heard the details of a gruesome crime, they may have a difficult time evaluating evidence of the defendant\u2019s intellectual disability without bias.",
      "Most states allow defendants the opportunity to prove their intellectual disability before the trial and have separate processes for determining a defendant's guilt and for determining their intellectual disability.",
      "\"Changing only the standard of proof is insufficient for ensuring that Georgia does not continue to execute people with valid claims of intellectual disability,\" said Mazie Lynn Guertin, executive director of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.",

      "Barksdale claims that the proposal would make the process too complicated and would prevent the death penalty from being carried out at all.",
      "\"As this law is constructed, and based on my experience of trying capital cases, it would, for all intents and purposes, cripple us to a point that we would never have a real fair shot at ever obtaining a death penalty for anyone,\" Barksdale said, adding that lawmakers should abolish the death penalty if that is what they want, but lawmakers have said that is not their intention.",

      "During two committee hearings on this bill, Republican and Democrat lawmakers seemed unconvinced that the procedural changes would make the process too complicated. Death penalty cases, they noted, already take a long time, including many motions and hearings ahead of the trial.",
      "\"We have the death penalty in this state. I'm not going to debate it,\" Democrat Rep. Esther Panitch, who is also a criminal defense attorney, said Tuesday. \"But if we're going to mete out the ultimate punishment, it should only be for the worst of the worst, and those we have spent the time to make sure understand their culpability.\"",

      "The president backed then-Rep. DeSantis successful 2018 run for governor and the two were allies for a couple of years. But the two GOP heavyweights waged a bitter battle in 2023 and early last year during a very combative and divisive 2024 GOP presidential nomination race. They seemed to make peace after Trump quickly clinched the nomination during the primaries, and DeSantis helped raise funds for Trump during the general election.",
      "After Donalds jumped into the race, DeSantis seemed to criticize the congressman, saying at a news conference that \"I think people look at it and say you\u2019ve got a guy like Byron, he just hasn\u2019t been a part of any of the victories that we\u2019ve had here over the left over these last years.\"",
      "Since he made those comments, the governor has refrained from criticizing Donalds, but has repeatedly touted his wife's accomplishments as Florida first lady and framing her as a worthy successor.",

      "Casey DeSantis last week stoked speculation when asked by reporters if she would run.",
      "\"To quote the late\u00a0Yogi Berra,\" DeSantis said as she reiterated a famous line from the late baseball legend. \"If you see a fork in the road, take it.\"",
      "The governor then quipped to reporters that \"you guys can read into that what you will.\"",
      "Fox News last week also confirmed that Gov. DeSantis was reaching out to donors on behalf of his wife.",
      "Asked about Casey DeSantis, Donald told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo this past weekend that \"I remember back in 2018 campaigning for then-Congressman DeSantis, who had the support of Donald Trump, and that worked out great for our state. So, in 2025, moving into 2026, I am really honored to have the same support from President Trump.\"",
      "\"He has a history of making good picks, and I think his picks have always worked out for the Sunshine State,\" Donald emphasized.",

      "And he added that \"we will worry about the primaries as other people decide to get in the race or not, but we are going to be focused on Floridians.\"",
      "While Florida was once a top general election battleground, it's now firmly red - DeSantis won re-election in 2022 by nearly 20 points and Trump carried the state in November by 13 points - and the eventual winner of the GOP primary will be considered the front-runner in next year's gubernatorial election."

      "Companies that handle massive amounts of user data are often the least careful with it. Last year, the National Public Data breach\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond. Now, another breach has surfaced, this time affecting DISA Global Solutions, an employee screening provider.",

      "What you need to know",
      "DISA Global Solutions, a company specializing in employee screening services, recently\u00a0disclosed a major data breach affecting over 3.3 million individuals. The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

According to filings with the attorneys general of Maine and\u00a0Massachusetts, the compromised information included Social Security numbers, financial account details (such as credit card numbers), driver\u2019s licenses and other government-issued identification documents.",
      "Given DISA\u2019s role in employee screening, the breach likely exposed data collected from background checks and drug tests, potentially including employment histories, criminal records and even health-related information. The notification to affected individuals \u2013 more than 360,000 were Massachusetts residents and 15,198 from Maine \u2013 underscored the breadth of the incident, affecting a staggering 3,332,750 people nationwide.",

      "If you\u2019ve undergone a background check or drug test through an employer or prospective employer, your data might be among the millions exposed in this breach. Here are five practical steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

They've created a biohybrid hand, a fusion of lab-grown muscle tissue and mechanical engineering, capable of gripping and making gestures. This innovation paves the way for a new generation of robotics with diverse applications.",

      "While soft robots and advanced prosthetics are becoming increasingly common, the combination of living tissue and machines is still relatively rare. The field of biohybrid science is in its infancy, with only a few examples, such as artificial fish powered by human heart cells or robots using locust ears for hearing. This new biohybrid hand represents a significant step forward in the practical application of this technology.",

      "So, how did they do it? The team started by growing muscle fibers in the lab. Recognizing that these delicate tissues wouldn't be strong enough on their own, they bundled them into what they call \"multiple tissue actuators,\" or MuMuTAs. \"Our key achievement was developing the MuMuTAs,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from the University of Tokyo.",
      "Takeuchi is the co-author of a study describing the creation that was published in the journal\u00a0Science Robotics. Shoji explained that creating MuMuTAs was their key achievement.

      "Challenges and future directions",
      "Takeuchi and his team acknowledge that their creation is currently a proof of concept. During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",
      "This is not the first time Zacks has suffered a breach. Previous incidents include a 2022 attack that compromised an older Zacks Elite product database from 1999 to 2005, as noted on Zacks' own breach disclosure page.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

    "summary": "Just two months into 2025 there have been numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, ranging from infostealers to malicious software.",
    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "\"To put it more bluntly, guards are holding hostage tens of thousands of incarcerated people, whose basic survival needs are often going unmet, in order to demand even more power to harm those in their custody,\" Saldana said.",
      "The deal between the state and officers' union to end the officers' strike included ways to address staffing shortages and minimize mandatory 24-hour overtime shifts. The agreement also offers a temporary increase in overtime pay and a potential change in pay scale.",

      "Before Trump proposed resettling Gazans outside the enclave, Egypt and other Arab states had shown little interest in Gaza's reconstruction. However, given that Egypt has ruled out accepting displaced Palestinians for \"national security\" reasons, it now finds itself compelled to devise its own plan.",
      "With a $53 billion price tag, the plan is positioned as an alternative to Trump\u2019s vision, and key details have already been shared by Arab media outlets. While Egypt proposes a temporary committee to manage Gaza for six months, Palestinians have made it clear that they will not accept any governing body that isn't Palestinian or any foreign forces within Gaza.

      "The Egyptian plan is divided into two phases: the first, lasting two years and costing around $20 billion, and the second, spanning two and a half years with a $30 billion allocation. The funds will primarily go toward rebuilding residential areas devastated by conflict.",
      "Importantly, the plan does not call for the displacement of Gaza's residents, as Trump\u2019s proposal does, and stresses the importance of Palestinian-led reconstruction efforts, and that the Palestinian Authority will collaborate with Egypt and Jordan to train a police force for Gaza. But Hamas has already rejected the plan, and the Palestinian Authority has made it clear that it will not engage in reconstruction efforts as long as Hamas maintains control.",
      "\"The Saudis will fund Gaza if there\u2019s a path to a Palestinian state and Hamas is gone,\" Ghaith Al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and former executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine told Fox News Digital, \"Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar want something from the Israelis in return, whether it's an end to the war or security agreements. They\u2019ll insist on a role for the Palestinian Authority, even if symbolic, for diplomatic reasons. The question is whether the current Israeli government can meet these demands.\"",

The Emiratis are even more extreme on this issue,\" Danny Zaken, a senior commentator for Israel Hayom newspaper, told Fox News Digital, \"The final draft of the Egyptian plan will avoid directly addressing Hamas. Instead of stating that Hamas will be removed and disarmed, it will say that \u2018qualified Palestinian security forces will maintain order with Egyptian backing.\u2019 This approach aims for unanimous approval without addressing Hamas\u2019 fate, but the reality is that it has no practical validity, because in that case the plan has no financial backing,\" he explained.",

      "An Egyptian diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that Egyptian construction firms are ready to begin work, but the real challenge is political. \"Egyptian construction companies are very capable, and they can rebuild Gaza in three years \u2013 if there is political will, mainly from Israel and the U.S.,\" the source said.",

      "While Egypt is eager to lead the reconstruction process, its ambitions have created friction with key Gulf states, which are expected to finance much of the effort. Zaken, noted, \"The Saudis are concerned because the Egyptians want to control the entire process: Who gets the money, who oversees the reconstruction, who the contractors are for demolition and rebuilding? And even new housing and hotels. The other partners worry about corruption in the process.\"",
      "A former U.S. foreign service official warned Fox News Digital that Egypt\u2019s ability to manage such funds is a concern. \"The Gulf, which is expected to pay for it, is sick and tired of Egyptian corruption. If they fund the reconstruction, they will demand major oversight to ensure the money doesn\u2019t get lost in Egypt\u2019s power structure,\" the source said.",

      "Meanwhile, Jordan, which has played a key diplomatic role, has managed to avoid direct involvement in the reconstruction debate. Following King Abdullah\u2019s meeting with Trump, Jordanian officials felt that the pressure had shifted to Egypt and other Arab states. \"The Jordanians were very happy with the outcome of the meeting with Trump. They feel that the pressure to accept [a] million Gazans is off them,\" Al-Omari said.",
      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this. No one expects immediate results, but they do hope that this will move Trump away from the idea of depopulating Gaza,\" he said.",

      "Taiwan needs a strong military to deter its hostile neighbor located roughly 100 miles to the west. In recent years, China has stepped up both bombastic threats and incursions into Taiwan\u2019s air and sea defense zones as it attempts to squeeze Taiwan into submission.",

Over 20 years ago, \"Uncle Topher\" was Captain Christopher Clifford, U.S. 101 Airborne Division. Serving during the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq gave him an up-close look at the difficulties of invasion, and the even harder challenges of occupation.",
      "Speaking to Fox News Digital in Kaohsiung City, Clifford said that much of his content is aimed at challenging \"China invasion sensationalism.\" He often points out to viewers that, as a result of China\u2019s now-reversed \"One-Child Policy,\" Chinese men of fighting age are commonly highly valued \"only sons,\" men who have a traditional duty to carry on family linages. More importantly, says Clifford, is the economic toll a war would have on not just the region, but the planet \u2013 a conflict Clifford believes China may literally not be able to afford.",

      "Leaning into culture wars, Trump inveighed against transgender rights, \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed \u201cinsane and very dangerous open border policies\u201d\u00a0and offering little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.",

      "Trump spent significant time on issues from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.",
      "Trump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year \u2014 specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals as they seek to pass a big party-line bill to advance core pieces of Trump's agenda. They are still seeking to find room for the trillions of dollars in tax breaks Trump has called for.",
      "Trump also called for repealing the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that passed the Senate 64-33 and was signed by Biden in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe should get rid of the Chip Act,\u201d Trump said, referring to the law that invests in domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing.",
      "Democrats heckle, wave signs and interrupt",
      "Within minutes of Trump\u2019s beginning, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, interrupted and heckled him, yelling, \u201cYou have no mandate to cut Medicaid.\u201d He was escorted out after he refused to stop shouting. There were other unintelligible shouts from Democrats during the speech. At another point, several Democratic members walked out in protest.",
      "A group of House Democrats waved signs that read \u201cMUSK STEALS,\u201d \u201cSAVE MEDICAID\u201d and \u201cPROTECT VETERANS.\u201d Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought a whiteboard and wrote different messages on it through Trump\u2019s speech, including \u201cNO KING\u201d and \u201cLIES.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats laughed out loud when Trump said the era of rule by \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d is over, and they pointed at Trump\u2019s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who watched from the gallery.",
      "Other Democrats skipped the speech entirely, including Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, who wants to lead his party\u2019s strategy, and Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and the recent former Senate president pro tempore.",
      "The top three Democratic leaders in each chamber attended. They, like most others in the party, sat quietly and listened without disrupting Trump\u2019s remarks, as Democrats work through their loss last year and how best to advance their agenda and oppose Trump's in 2025 and beyond.",
      "Trump soaks in GOP adulation",
      "It has been months since Trump played to the crowd at one of his signature political rallies. He got a hero\u2019s welcome and a standing ovation from Republicans in the Capitol, who regularly leaped to their feet to applaud him.",
      "As Trump said he is waging the \u201cmost sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history\u201d and touted actions he has taken, the GOP side of the aisle erupted into chants of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump had no olive branch to offer his opponents, instead needling Democrats at the beginning of his speech, saying there was nothing he could say that would make them clap or smile \u2014 and later blasting \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d whom he called weak on crime. In response, some Democrats yelled, \u201cJanuary 6th!\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s pardons of rioters who stormed the Capitol, some of whom attacked police officers.",
      "Biden offered during his first address to Congress to team up on \u201cbipartisan\u201d goals \u2014 a word he used multiple times in 2021 \u2014 like infrastructure, cancer research and access to education.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, chided Democrats early in his speech for refusing to give him enough. He set the tone early by calling Biden \u201cthe worst president in American history\u201d and played to a longtime presidential tradition: blaming his predecessor for problems facing the country.",
      "\u201cEverybody here \u2014 even this side \u2014 I appreciate you,\u201d Trump quipped, drawing laughter from the GOP side of the aisle.",
      "What was missing",
      "A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans and packing in applause lines in Trump's address.",
      "The return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention. But Trump didn\u2019t delve much deeper into the broader issues facing Israel, its current ceasefire agreement with Hamas or the rebuilding of Gaza, about which he has repeatedly posted on social media.",
      "As the GOP's budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid \u2014 a major part of the federal budget that could be a target for changes \u2014 or health care generally, beyond a brief endorsement of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "And while Elon Musk got a shoutout and Trump listed off spending the Department of Government Efficiency was seeking to cut, Trump didn\u2019t delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public. He did note that federal workers have been ordered to return to in-person work or be fired, and broadly, Trump said his \"administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy\" of \"hundreds of thousands\" of federal workers who he said haven't been showing up.",
      "Ukraine, Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "Trump lamented the billions of dollars the United States has spent to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia\u2019s incursion, drawing ironic and extended applause from Democrats who support the military and economic assistance.",
      "\u201cYou want to keep it going for another five years?\u201d Trump asked.",
      "\u201cPocahontas says yes,\u201d he said, using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., which prompted numerous Democrats to walk out of the chamber.",
      "Trump also kept up his calls to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland into U.S. control.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China. We gave it to Panama. We\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Trump said of the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe need Greenland for national security and international security,\u201d he continued, calling it a\u00a0\u201cvery, very large piece of land.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d he said as Republicans applauded and laughed."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its stake in two Panama Canal ports to U.S. and Swiss investors amid pressure from the Trump administration over the ports\u2019 ties to China.",
      "CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday.",
      "President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal.",
      "Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "\u201cMy administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S.",
      "In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President\u00a0Jimmy Carter\u00a0and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump told Congress on Tuesday. \u201cWe gave it to Panama and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Both China and Panama deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution.",
      "\u201cChina supports Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cChina has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Crist\u00f3bal port on the Atlantic side.",
      "It does not affect the company\u2019s ports in China.",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release.",
      "The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.",
      "Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state.",
      "Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a\u00a0bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory\u00a0by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047.",
      "Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S.",
      "The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency.",
      "Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city.",
      "The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."

      "In his remarks, Trump bent the facts on issues including Social Security, immigration, fentanyl and the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "Here's what Trump got right \u2014 and wrong \u2014 during his 100-minute address.",
      "Economic issues",
      "Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.\u201d",
      "This is false.",
      "Trump alleged in his speech that millions of senior citizens over age 100 \u2014 including some he maintained were older than 160 \u2014 were collecting Social Security checks, according to Social Security Administration data.",
      "Trump specifically said that SSA records indicated that 4.7 million people 100 to 109 were getting checks, that 3.6 million 110 to 119 were, that 3.47 million 120 to 129 were, that 3.9 million 130 to 139 were, that 3.5 million 140 to 149 were, that 1.3 million 150 to 159 were \u2014 and that even 130,000 people older than 160 years old were still getting checks.",
      "He also alleged that several hundred people older than 220 were still getting checks, according to SSA data \u2014 and that \u201cone person is listed at 360 of age.\u201d",
      "The alleged fraud that Trump \u2014 and DOGE chief Elon Musk \u2014 have pointed to doesn\u2019t exist. Rather, the numbers they refer to are products of a known problem with the government\u2019s data.",
      "There are millions of people over age 100 in the Social Security Administration\u2019s database,\u00a0but the vast majority aren\u2019t receiving benefits.",
      "Inspectors general at the agency have repeatedly\u00a0identified the issue, but the Social Security Administration has argued that updating old records is costly and unnecessary.",
      "An SSA IG\u00a0report from 2023 showed\u00a018.9 million people listed as 100 years or older \u2014 but not dead \u2014 were in the database. But \u201calmost none\u201d currently receive SSA payments.",
      "The SSA\u2019s inspector general also found in a report released in July that from 2015 to 2022,\u00a0only 0.84% of benefits payments were improper. That 0.84% of improper benefits payments totaled $71.8 billion over eight years. The report also says most of the improper payments were overpayments \u2014 not payments to dead people or people who didn\u2019t qualify.",
      "In addition,\u00a0according to the agency\u2019s online records, just 89,106 people \u2014 not tens of millions \u2014 over age 99 received retirement benefits in December, out of the more than 70 million people who receive benefits every year.",
      "Trump said: \"Joe Biden especially let the price of EGGS get out of control \u2014 and we are working hard to get it back down.\"",
      "This needs context.",
      "It\u2019s true that egg spices spiked during Biden\u2019s presidency as inflation rose steadily. The average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked during the Biden administration in January 2023 at $4.32, according to\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics data. It eventually retreated, falling to less than half that by late 2023, before it rose again last year.",
      "According to that\u00a0government data, however, the average price of one dozen Grade A eggs peaked this January at $4.95, a month in office that Trump shared with Biden \u2014 a product of the\u00a0growing transmission of\u00a0bird flu among chickens.\u00a0That is nearly double the price they were in January 2024 ($2.52).",
      "Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made, never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it, that, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people, and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\u201d",
      "This is mostly false.",
      "No automaker has announced a new plant since Trump took office and began instituting new tariffs.\u00a0Reuters reported\u00a0that Honda planned to produce 210,000 Civics in Indiana instead of Mexico, but the company hasn\u2019t made a public announcement.",
      "What\u2019s more, it\u2019s unclear whether Honda would expand its operations in Indiana, open a new plant or simply move production of the new Civic to the plant and reduce production of other vehicles there, too. Honda\u2019s Indiana plant produces as many as 250,000 vehicles annually.",
      "In addition, Trump\u2019s move to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico\u00a0could add thousands of dollars\u00a0to the cost of each new vehicle.",
      "Immigration",
      "Trump said: \"Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.\"",
      "This is false.",
      "Springfield and Aurora have long been some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets when it comes to examples of American cities he likes to nod to as being overrun by migrants, though he often misrepresents the situations there.",
      "He didn\u2019t mention any specific allegations about the two cities in his speech \u2014 but his reference to them is a clear nod to previous false allegations about them.",
      "For example, Trump\u00a0repeated a baseless claim\u00a0about Haitian immigrants in Springfield eating dogs and other pets during a debate last year. The story provide false, however. The culprit was a non-migrant woman in a nearby town.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump also painted a sinister picture of Aurora during the campaign. At a rally there in October,\u00a0he alleged the city had been overtaken by a Venezuelan prison gang\u00a0\u2014 Tren de Aragua \u2014 after a social media clip went viral claiming the gang had taken over an apartment complex in Aurora.",
      "Police at the time said there was no evidence the gang had taken over the complex, and Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, called Trump\u2019s\u00a0descriptions \u201cnot accurate.\u201d",
      "Trump said of Canada and Mexico: \u201cThey\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "This is partly false.",
      "While fentanyl comes across the border from Mexico in significant numbers, Canada is hardly to blame for the crisis. In the 2024 fiscal year, fentanyl seizures at the northern border were just 43 pounds, according to\u00a0Customs and Border Protection data. Meanwhile, more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border during the same period.",
      "Trump said: \u201cOver the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.\u201d",
      "This is misleading.",
      "According to Customs and Border Protection data, the Biden administration had more than an estimated 14 million migrant encounters at and between ports of entry at U.S. borders.",
      "More than 118,000 migrants with criminal backgrounds were apprehended at U.S. borders during that time \u2014 a small part of the more than over 14 million migrant encounters. There have been instances of migrants found to have criminal records from their home countries after they\u2019ve entered the United States, but there is no evidence to support that it is widespread, and immigration officials have long cited challenges with getting criminal records from certain migrants\u2019 home countries before they cross the border.",
      "The Trump administration has frequently cited the presence of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in the United States and the high-profile killing of the Georgia nursing student Laken Riley last year by a Venezuelan national who entered the country illegally in 2022 as indicative of widespread migrant crime.",
      "Trump said: \u201cSince taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history \u2014 and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.\u201d",
      "This appears to be true, but questions about the specifics remain.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump is speaking about border crossings, encounters and/or apprehensions.",
      "According to\u00a0Customs and Border Protection data\u00a0from 2000 to 2019 that compares apprehensions across the various sectors by month, the month with the fewest crossings on record was April 2017, at 11,677.",
      "CPB says,\u00a0\u201cFrom Jan. 21 through Jan. 31, 2025, the number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border dropped 85% from the same period in 2024.\u201d",
      "Trump claimed\u00a0last month on Truth Social: \u201cThere were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. \u2014 Mexico Border.\u201d",
      "Health",
      "Trump said: \u201cAs an example, not long ago, and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s 1 in 36. There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36, think of that, so we\u2019re going to find out what it is.\u201d",
      "This needs context.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this ratio is correct. But the statistic is often used to justify opposition to vaccination.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0has pointed to vaccines to explain the substantial rise in autism diagnoses in recent decades, which have ballooned from an estimated\u00a01 in 150\u00a0children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today.",
      "But the\u00a0science is clear that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism.",
      "Rather, research suggests that much of the increase\u00a0is due to increasing awareness\u00a0and\u00a0screening\u00a0for the condition, changing definitions of autism\u00a0to include milder conditions on the spectrum that weren\u2019t recognized in previous years and advances in diagnostic technology.",
      "Finding the causes of autism is complicated, because it\u2019s not a single disorder, scientists and experts\u00a0have told NBC News. In addition, those scientists and experts have said they believe that people develop autistic traits because of a combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental exposures.",
      "International",
      "Trump said: \u201cEurope has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. And we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion, and they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. And we have an ocean separating us, and they don\u2019t. And Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent.\u201d",
      "This is mostly false.",
      "From Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 to last December, the United States had allocated $114.2 billion in aid to Ukraine,\u00a0according to the Kiel Institute, which is tracking aid to Ukraine. That\u2019s not more than Europe spent: Those nations allocated more than $132.3 billion, with plans to allocate more.",
      "Trump is correct in pointing out that Europe has spent more on oil and gas than it spent on military assistance last year, according to estimates from the\u00a0Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Oil and gas taxes account for a huge share of Russia\u2019s revenues each year.",
      "Polling",
      "Trump said: \u201cFor the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "This is false.",
      "Trump appears to be cherry-picking a single poll result and ignoring a few strong numbers from\u00a0early in Biden\u2019s term. While he doesn\u2019t cite his source, it seems likely he\u2019s pointing to a\u00a0recent Rasmussen Reports poll\u00a0showing that 47% say America\u2019s on the \u201cright track.\u201d",
      "Rasmussen is a right-wing poll that regularly partners with conservative authors and outlets to sponsor its polling. And it\u2019s controversial \u2014 the polling aggregation site\u00a0FiveThirtyEight removed the poll from its averages last year\u00a0over concerns about its partisanship and its methodology.",
      "It\u2019s true that many polls have shown a bump in the classic \u201cright track, wrong track\u201d question since Trump took office. For example, NPR/Marist/PBS\u2019\u00a0newest poll found 45% saying the country is moving in the right direction, up from 35% in December and from even lower during earlier parts of the Biden administration.",
      "But those highs have been hit before \u2014 47% said America was moving in the right direction in a July 2021 poll from NPR/Marist/PBS (49% thought it was moving in the wrong direction). And just months earlier, a\u00a0Politico/Morning Consult poll\u00a0found 51% of registered voters saying the country was going in the right direction."

      "He quickly embarked on a road show to build momentum for his agenda. Two days after the speech, he traveled to Newport News, Virginia, where he stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier as he pledged to strengthen the U.S. military.",
      "The following day, he visited a Catholic school near Orlando, Florida, to showcase his commitment to school choice.",
      "But these are different times and Trump is at a different stage in life: older and fresh off a comeback that defied all the rules of modern American politics.",
      "His advisers don\u2019t see any drawback to hunkering down at home. In terms of raw politics, Trump\u2019s name won\u2019t be on the ballot again, meaning there\u2019s no compelling need to blanket the swing states ahead of a re-election campaign that isn\u2019t happening unless he can somehow amend the Constitution.",
      "One person involved in Trump\u2019s political operation said, \u201cThe next time he has to leave the White House [or Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach residence] for political reasons will be for the midterms to sell candidates.\u201d",
      "Another person close to the administration\u2019s planning said they\u2019ve not heard of any travel in the works.",
      "\u201cWhy would he leave D.C.?\u201d this person said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is working.\u201d",
      "The senior administration official echoed that point, saying that \u201ca lot of work\u201d is being done at the White House, and Trump is comfortable explaining his actions from the Oval Office.",
      "\u201cThe priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,\u201d said the official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "In a prepared statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cited Trump\u2019s early trip, when he toured hurricane damage in North Carolina and then flew to the Los Angeles area for a firsthand look at the wildfire wreckage. He also gave a speech in Las Vegas centered on the economy.",
      "\u201cHe will continue to work hard on behalf of the American people and deliver on his promises \u2014 whether it\u2019s from behind the Resolute Desk or while traveling across the country,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "A willing and eager stand-in is prepared to pick up any travel Trump chooses to forgo: Vance.",
      "\"The vice president has dutifully traveled wherever the president needs him to, and he will continue to do so,\u201d Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said. \u201cPresident Trump and Vice President Vance have demonstrated that a promise made by this administration will be a promise kept, and that no community across America will be forgotten.\u201d",
      "Unlike the 78-year-old Trump, the 40-year-old Vance may well have political ambitions in 2028 and beyond. Traveling the world offers a vice president a rich opportunity to build name recognition while advancing White House priorities.",
      "Vance so far has represented the White House in two domestic crises.",
      "In late January, he toured Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Damascus, Virginia, with Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "The following week, Vance visited East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a toxic train derailment in 2023.",
      "Trump and his advisers have long considered Trump\u2019s trip there shortly after the spill to be a turning point in his improbable bid to return to power.",
      "But it was Vance they dispatched on the second anniversary to pledge the administration\u2019s commitment to finishing the ongoing cleanup.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Vance carried the Trumpian message overseas last month at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "In a speech that caused a stir internationally, Vance took aim at European leaders and served up what proved to be a preview of his and Trump\u2019s Oval Office confrontation last week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cThe threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia. It\u2019s not China,\u201d Vance said in Munich. \u201cIt\u2019s not any external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within \u2014 the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "On the day Vance gave that speech, Trump left the White House for the long President's Day weekend at Mar-a-Lago."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-tariffs-fentanyl-overdose-deaths-declining-rcna194752",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 03:39:57 GMT",
    "summary": "While President Donald Trump has said the tariffs are meant stop the flow of drugs across the border, experts worry it may undermine progress already underway.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says a primary reason for his new tariffs against the United States\u2019 three largest trading partners is what he calls a \u201cnational emergency\u201d brought on by fentanyl flowing across the country\u2019s borders.",
      "Trump says he is holding Canada, China and Mexico accountable for the spread of contraband drugs.",
      "\"They\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before,\" he said in a joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, referring to Mexico and Canada, \"killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families.\"",
      "But the tariffs come as the fentanyl epidemic is showing glimmers of improvement, drug policy experts and economic researchers say.",
      "They fear that the 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada and 20% on all Chinese imports will only erode the international cooperation needed to thwart global drug trafficking operations.",
      "\u201cTariffs are not the sharpest tool in terms of negotiating with other countries and getting them to go along with drug and border policies,\u201d said Bob McNab, chair of the economics department at Old Dominion University in Virginia. \u201cThis is akin to having a fence-line dispute with your neighbor and taking a sledgehammer with you.\u201d",
      "After years of rising overdose deaths, the United States recorded 87,000 drug overdose deaths from October 2023 to September 2024, a decrease from 114,000 the previous year, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "That was the lowest overdose death toll in any 12-month period since June 2020, the CDC said. Overdose deaths surpassed more than 100,000 for the first time in 2021, with the majority linked to synthetic opioid use. The crisis has devastated small communities and urban centers alike.",
      "Vanda Felbab-Brown, who studies international organized crime as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit think tank, cited two major factors that have helped curb fentanyl\u2019s devastating effects in the United States: law enforcement efforts during the Biden administration to combat the fentanyl production pipeline in China and Mexico and the widespread availability of the overdose reversal medication naloxone.",
      "\u201cThese are potentially very ephemeral, but they all predate the tariffs,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition, law enforcement has continued to confiscate fentanyl at the border. About 21,900 pounds of the drug were seized in the 2024 fiscal year. That\u2019s down from over 27,000 in fiscal year 2023 but up from the 14,700 in 2022, according to Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Nearly all of that fentanyl was taken at the U.S. southern border. In the current fiscal year, just 10 pounds have been recovered along the Canadian border to date, compared with 5,400 along the Mexican border, CBP data shows.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau balked at Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying Tuesday that there was \u201cno justification\u201d for them because \u201cless than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the U.S. border came from Canada.\u201d",
      "Last month, after Trump first threatened to impose tariffs, Trudeau announced that he would appoint a \u201cfentanyl czar\u201d and designate cartels as terrorist organizations.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who assumed office in October, has also tried to work with the Trump administration by amassing thousands of her country\u2019s troops along the border last month to snuff out drugs. Sheinbaum has been aggressive with Mexico\u2019s drug cartels, deploying troops to go after such crime in the state of Sinaloa.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico would respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs by Sunday. Canada and China have already announced retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. goods, stoking fears of an all-out trade war.",
      "Gladys McCormick, the Moskowitz endowed chair in Mexico-U.S. relations at Syracuse University, said the tariffs may cause an \u201cirrevocable damage of trust\u201d between the United States and Mexico, with the latter instead leaning more heavily on China, its second-largest trading partner.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused China-based companies of producing and selling fentanyl precursors, which are used to manufacture the drug, and distributing them around the world, including to Mexico, where cartels create synthetic opioids.",
      "Mexico\u2019s leaders may still seek to negotiate with the Trump administration to prevent the Mexican economy from faltering, McCormick said.",
      "\u201cThe consequences of pushing the Mexican economy into a forced and deep recession is that, if anything, it will actually make people have to resort to informal economic activity, which oftentimes is illicit,\u201d she said.",
      "Fentanyl is a powerful drug used as an anesthetic and painkiller in hospital settings. U.S. drug officials say illegal fentanyl began originating out of China about a decade ago, spreading illicitly in part as a consequence of the opioid epidemic that started with addictive painkillers like oxycontin. Fentanyl is far cheaper to produce, but it can be up to 50 times deadlier than heroin, although some versions can be less potent.",
      "McNab said Trump\u2019s new tariffs don\u2019t address other ways fentanyl enters the United States, including smuggling by Americans. Americans were 80% of all people caught with fentanyl during border crossings at ports of entry from 2019 to 2024, according to CBP data obtained by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.",
      "\u201cWe would all agree it\u2019s a laudable goal if tariffs can stop the importation of fentanyl and stop individuals crossing the border illegally into the United States,\u201d McNab said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if, at the end of the day, if all this costs us hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic activity, is that worth the cost of less fentanyl coming across our border?\u201d",
      "Some states have seen the tide turn in the fentanyl crisis over recent months.",
      "Dennis Cauchon, the founder and president of Harm Reduction Ohio, which supports progressive drug policies, said he has witnessed a drastic decline in his state in fentanyl-related overdose deaths over the past two years. State officials say Ohio has been outperforming the national decline by expanding naloxone distribution and treatment services.",
      "Cauchon also attributes the 2023 breakup of the top leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel, once led by kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n Loera, for disrupting the fentanyl market.",
      "\u201cTariffs may get the credit in the future, but the reality is fentanyl has been declining at historic levels for two years,\u201d Cauchon said. \u201cWhether that continues is hard to guess.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:44:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Pediatricians are trying to manage anxious parents begging for early measles vaccinations and those who refuse the shot, leading to delicate discussions.",
    "story": [
      "One mom told her pediatrician she was skipping a checkup for her 4-month-old because she was afraid the baby would catch measles from the doctor\u2019s office before he could be vaccinated \u2014 even though there were no cases reported in the area. Another parent said he was refusing to inoculate his 1-year-old because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cexperiment\u201d on his child.",
      "These and other recent discussions about measles vaccinations at Dr. Alex Cvijanovich\u2019s Albuquerque, New Mexico, pediatric practice have been fraught since the highly contagious virus started making national headlines \u2014 and they\u2019re only getting more challenging.",
      "\u201cThe people who are willing, are willing to give it early,\u201d said Cvijanovich, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cBut the people who have dug in their heels, it just becomes a more frustrating conversation.\u201d",
      "As virus cases rise and the United States recorded its first measles death in a decade, pediatricians are in a dilemma. How do they convey the seriousness of the virus to vaccine-skeptical parents while also quelling the anxieties of families who want to immunize their newborns but can\u2019t yet?",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, according to six doctors in practices from West Virginia to Washington state. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination has a proven track record against the highly contagious disease, with two doses of the shot 97% effective against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Decades of studies have shown it to be safe and have refuted false claims that it is linked to autism.",
      "The measles outbreak so far has been concentrated in West Texas. But it comes at a pivotal moment for the country: Vaccine hesitancy, on the uptick for years, accelerated during the Covid pandemic. And now misinformation about vaccines has been spreading, fueled in part by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who led a large anti-vaccine advocacy group before becoming head of Health and Human Services last month. Shortly after his confirmation, Kennedy vowed to investigate the schedule for childhood vaccines that prevent dangerous diseases like measles.",
      "Pediatricians say they\u2019re seeing a lot of fear, both from parents who trust vaccinations and those who don\u2019t, and they worry the anxiety from both sides will create confusion that will hamper public health efforts. The death of an unvaccinated child in Texas last month has not been enough to sway everyone to immunize their children, and pediatricians are worried more kids will get sick.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is still snowballing,\u201d said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas. \u201cI think we still have a lot of work to do, to be very honest with you.\u201d",
      "The CDC recommends administering the first MMR shot at around age 1 and the second at ages 4 to 6. In cases where an infant has been exposed to measles or is traveling to a known outbreak area, pediatricians can administer a dosage as early as 6 months old \u2014 something some parents have pleaded for as more measles cases are reported.",
      "Most children in the United States receive their MMR vaccinations on schedule, with nearly 93% receiving the shots by kindergarten, according to the CDC.",
      "But in West Texas, where the measles outbreak is concentrated with at least 159 reported cases, vaccination rates are significantly lower. In Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, the immunization exemption rate was more than 17% for the 2023-2024 school year, according to health department data.",
      "Experts say that at least 95% of a community must be vaccinated to protect against a measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe rely on herd immunity for measles prevention,\u201d said Dr. Christina Hermos, division chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology at UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center. \u201cMeasles is so incredibly contagious that you only need one person flying in or traveling to a region to give a nonimmune person a case.\u201d",
      "The respiratory virus spreads rapidly because it is transmitted through droplets that can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours, meaning an infected person doesn\u2019t have to remain in a room to contaminate other people. Measles causes a telltale rash, but an infected individual can spread the virus up to four days before the rash appears.",
      "Measles also causes fevers and red, watery eyes and can lead to complications such as pneumonia or, in rare cases, brain damage and death. For every 1,000 children who get measles, about one to three will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.",
      "The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000, despite some cases being reported since.",
      "Pediatricians now fear the country could backslide in its containment efforts, especially because Kennedy has long criticized childhood vaccinations.",
      "As the measles outbreak has unfolded under his watch, he has not urged widespread vaccination, drawing ire from health experts and politicians. In an op-ed published on Fox News\u2019 website, he called the decision to vaccinate \u201ca personal one\u201d and wrote, \u201cAll parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.\u201d",
      "Dr. Elizabeth Meade, a Seattle pediatrician, said she finds it \u201cenormously concerning\u201d to have a vaccine-skeptic person as the nation\u2019s health secretary.",
      "\u201cI think there is this real sense among people in the United States that they are not at risk for these diseases, especially if they\u2019re not traveling outside of the U.S.,\u201d said Meade, who is also an American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson. \u201cUnfortunately, it is just not true.\u201d",
      "Some parents who once supported immunization have since changed their minds.",
      "\u201cI see incredibly intelligent people coming in,\u201d said Hermos, who in addition to being an infectious diseases doctor is an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School. \u201cTheir child has a full vaccination record, and then they\u2019re due for their next one, and they\u2019re completely convinced that they\u2019re making a decision between two potentially harmful things for their kids, like, \u2018I could potentially harm them with this vaccine versus I could potentially harm them with this disease of the vaccine.\u2019\u201d",
      "In Morgantown, West Virginia, pediatrician Dr. Lisa Costello has found that acknowledging the common ground she has with vaccine-hesitant parents is helpful.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s coming from the space that they\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for their child that they love, and it\u2019s a matter of having those conversations and sharing from the medical literature we have on this,\u201d said Costello, an assistant professor of pediatrics at West Virginia University.",
      "But it\u2019s keeping some parents of newborns home out of fear that, because others in the practice might not be vaccinating their children regularly, their tiny babies who are too young to get the MMR shot could be at risk.",
      "The doctors said there are steps that parents can take to protect their children if they are too young to get the vaccination, such as asking the adults who spend time near their kids if they are vaccinated themselves; asking at their day care if all children who are eligible for vaccinations have been immunized; and not being around anyone who is or recently was sick. They also recommended bringing up early vaccination with their pediatrician.",
      "\u201cThere are those folks now that are calling that are anxious about it and want to get it even earlier than the recommended schedule,\u201d said Dr. Steven Abelowitz, medical director of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to do it after six months, but make sure the insurance covers it and it\u2019s not out of pocket.\u201d",
      "In Texas, Motheral said her local health department has been giving free MMR vaccinations. She hopes more people will agree to receive them.",
      "\u201cIt is so sad that a disease that we once felt was eradicated in this country, and really still should be, is making a resurgence,\u201d she said. \u201cEven one death for measles is too many.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In early January, as the days of the Biden administration wound down and the Trump era loomed, five dozen Border Patrol agents deployed to predominantly Latino Kern County, 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, and began what they say was a targeted search for criminal immigrants.",
      "But attorneys for some who were subjected to their tactics that week said it was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d targeting people of a certain skin color, regardless of citizenship and status. In a lawsuit filed on Feb. 26, they allege that agents abused their power, made arrests without warrants and used trickery to get people to agree to leave the country. These actions left the region shaken, they said.",
      "\u201cThey stopped us because we look Latino or like farmworkers, because of the color of our skin. It was unfair,\u201d Maria Guadalupe Hernandez Espinoza, 46, a grandmother, said in a statement.",
      "Hernandez Espinoza, who was arrested on Jan. 7 after working her shift at a tomato greenhouse, is one of at least 40 people who were removed from the country under what is known as voluntary departure, the ACLU states in its complaint.",
      "On Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, 44, a U.S. citizen and 20-year Bakersfield, California, resident, the lawsuit states. He was on his way to a gardening job when agents blocked his truck, slashed his tires, dragged a passenger from the truck and arrested them, the complaint adds. They accused Campos Gutierrez of alien smuggling and held him for four hours, according to the lawsuit filed by United Farm Workers and five others.\u00a0He was not deported.",
      "\"This was a fishing expedition, in which Border Patrol didn't target any particular people, used racial profiling and swept through the community,\" Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California, told NBC News.",
      "Later that same day, Border Patrol agents pulled over Yolanda Aguilera Martinez, 56, a lawful permanent resident \u201cfor no discernible reason,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. A 45-year-old Kern County resident, Aguilera Martinez showed her California driver\u2019s license. Border Patrol ordered her out of the car, threw the mother and grandmother to the ground, handcuffed her and arrested her, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "While she was being held in the back of an SUV, an agent allowed her to call someone to send a photo of her legal residency card. After he scanned it, he told her \u201cget the f--- out of here,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The arrests were carried out 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, well beyond the 100 air miles from the border that Border Patrol has claimed as the zone where it can conduct warrantless searches.",
      "The Los Angeles Times, citing three former Biden administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported last week that El Centro sector Border Patrol chief agent Gregory Bovino \"went rogue\" with the operation and did it without knowledge of higher-ups.",
      "Asked for comment, Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, emailed a response attributed to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson that said Border Patrol enforcement actions are \u201chighly targeted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we discover any alleged or potential misconduct, we immediately refer it for investigation and cooperate fully with any criminal or administrative investigations,\u201d the spokesperson also said.",
      "The statement did not mention the allegations in the lawsuit nor whether Bovino's role in the arrests was under investigation. Jaime Ruiz, a CBP spokesperson, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "Bovino touted the arrests in Kern County on social media. His posts highlight those arrested with criminal backgrounds and include one that states that Border Patrol agents in that jurisdiction, known as a sector, \"go the extra mile \u2014 or 500 of them ...,\" a reference to the reach of its jurisdiction.",
      "In a statement last month, Bovino said that sector's responsibility stretches from the border \"all the way to the Oregon line.\"",
      "Shook the Central Valley 'to the core'",
      "The Border Patrol stated that 60 agents arrested 78 people \u2014 all were unlawfully present in the U.S. \u2014 in the three-day January operation. Those arrested included someone convicted of raping an 8-year-old girl and someone wanted on a warrant for a sex offense against a child. Other offenses included weapons charges, marijuana or other drug possession and drunk driving convictions, among other crimes, the agency said.",
      "But attorneys said the arrests have had wider impact, including among their clients, some of whom had no criminal convictions and were expelled. The agents\u2019 actions \u201chave shaken the Central Valley to its core,\u201d the attorneys stated referring to the California region.",
      "\"The level of trauma is very high. There are people \u2014 who were detained, shipped off to El Centro and then removed from the country \u2014 who had minor children who they were responsible for,\" said Ajay Krishnan, an attorney with Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP, which is representing some of the defendants.",
      "Plaintiffs are also being represented by American Civil Liberties Foundations of Northern California, Southern California, and San Diego and Imperial counties.",
      "A person can agree, by signing appropriate documents, to a \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d By doing so, the person avoids a deportation order and preserves the possibility of re-entering the country legally at a future time.",
      "But the person also risks being prohibited from applying for legal re-entry for several years, depending on how long they were in the U.S. without legal status and other factors.",
      "In several cases, the lawsuit alleges, agents told people to sign electronic pads without allowing them to see the document, failed to tell them of the possible consequences of voluntarily leaving the U.S., or didn\u2019t show or read them the document in their language. In some cases, according to the plaintiffs, agents told people they were signing for some other purpose or they pressured them into signing with threats of longer imprisonment or by subjecting them to difficult conditions and keeping them isolated.",
      "Juan Vargas Mendez, a 20-year resident of Kern County who is  married to a U.S. citizen and has no criminal history, was among those deported. Vargas Mendez, 37, was arrested while on his way from a ranch where he's worked for 10 years. According to the lawsuit, agents took his nasal spray that helps him breathe when he arrived at the El Centro holding facility and he was tricked into signing an agreement to voluntarily leave the country.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the agents of violating\u00a0the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights to protection from detention without a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally and from arrest without a warrant.",
      "\u201cThe person\u2019s perceived race, ethnic background or occupation cannot justify a detentive stop. Nor can a person\u2019s refusal to answer voluntary questions,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges the agents violated the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. Agents should not have expelled any of those they arrested or detained through \u201cvoluntary departure\u201d unless those people knowingly and voluntarily waived their right to an immigration hearing, lawyers stated in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWhen Border Patrol left Ms. Hernandez Espinoza in Mexicali, an agent gave her a copy of the document she had signed the day before,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIt was the first time Ms. Hernandez Espinoza saw that her signature was on a document purporting to agree to voluntary departure.\""

      "The Tates, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were arrested in late 2022 and formally indicted last year in Romania on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to that country, where they were sexually exploited.

He and his 36-year-old brother, Tristan, are vocal supporters of President Donald Trump.",
      "Andrew Tate previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech and his misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for getting sexually assaulted.",

      "Twenty-five Canadian suspects are charged with bilking American elders of $21 million as part of a \"grandparent scam,\" according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday.",
      "All 25, said to have operated out of Montreal and resided there or elsewhere in the province of Quebec, were charged with wire fraud in a case alleging they were part of a tech-savvy operation that victimized hundreds of U.S. retirees, the U.S. attorney for Vermont said in a statement.",
      "Thomas Demeo, special agent in charge of the Boston field office of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, said the defendants were part of a \"transnational criminal enterprise with the sole intent of defrauding hundreds of retirees of their life savings by preying on their emotions and deceiving them into thinking that their loved ones were in peril.\"",
      "Twenty-three of the 25 suspects were arrested in Canada on Tuesday, according to the statement. Two remain at large; the statement didn\u2019t indicate where they are believed to be.",
      "Prosecutors said defendants used a narrative known to law enforcement as the \"grandparent scam\": A grandparent is called and urged to send thousands of dollars to bail out a teenage or adult grandchild who was in a vehicle collision and then arrested. As part of the story, victims are told that the grandchild's case is under a strict gag order and that they're prohibited from telling anyone about their request for money, prosecutors said.",
      "Investigators found victims in 40 states, from Alabama to Wyoming, according to the indictment and the statement. While federal prosecutors estimated the operation\u2019s earnings at $21 million, it wasn\u2019t clear what individual victims lost.",
      "The federal grand jury indictment, filed under seal Feb. 20 in Vermont, where some of the victims live, includes an additional charge of money laundering for five of the suspects, who are alleged to have tried to hide the origins of their gains, the document said.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Vermont didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "U.S. prosecutors said some of the defendants were making calls to potential victims in Vermont when they were found at Montreal-area call centers in June during raids by Canadian law enforcement officials. The U.S. attorney's statement indicated the operation had been active since 2021.",
      "Five of the suspects, including the two who have yet to be arrested, helped manage the call centers, according to the U.S. attorney's statement.",
      "The indictment alleged all the defendants were part of a sophisticated operation, with some specializing in cold calling potential victims and, if they got traction, handing the calls off to \"closers\" who would try to get the potential victims to send money or have the cash ready for pickup.",
      "The calls were based on spreadsheets detailing information about potential victims, including names, addresses, phone numbers and estimated household incomes, according to the indictment.",
      "The operation relied on contemporary technology that was used to mask calls coming from Quebec so they appeared to come from the United States, prosecutors said in the indictment.",
      "The scammers frequently changed their phone numbers by switching the SIM cards on phones they used, prosecutors said.",
      "The operation had associates posing as bail bond firm workers pick up cash from victims' homes, prosecutors said in the indictment, but sometimes a victim was in an area out of reach. That's when, prosecutors allege, the defendants used ride-hailing services that offer pickup and delivery to collect the money.",
      "Other times, they would have victims mail the money to a home they had identified as abandoned through searches on real estate websites, according to the indictment.",
      "And when it came time to get the gains to Canada, prosecutors said in Tuesday's statement, the suspects sometimes used cryptocurrency to obscure the source of the money.",
      "Prosecutors will seek forfeiture of the allegedly stolen funds, according to the indictment.",
      "The five defendants who face charges of wire fraud and money laundering face the possibility of 40 years behind bars if they are convicted, according to the U.S. attorney's statement. The 20 who face a single charge, that of wire fraud, would face 20 years, it said.",
      "The defendants haven\u2019t appeared in federal court, according to court records, and it\u2019s unclear whether they have lawyers. The federal public defender\u2019s office for Vermont didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Former Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley lost an appeal to get her old job back in a hearing Tuesday before the City Council that included the 25-year department veteran\u2019s first extensive public comments about the events that led to her firing.",
      "Crowley delivered an impassioned 11-minute plea before the City Council as she appealed Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 decision to dismiss her in the wake of the deadly January wildfires. In the end, the council voted 13-2 to receive and file the appeal, shelving the matter and effectively ending Crowley\u2019s bid for reinstatement.",
      "Crowley needed 10 council members to side with her to be\u00a0reinstated, according to the city charter.",
      "\u201cI am very grateful that I have the opportunity to appeal and to speak my truth,\u201d Crowley said outside City Hall.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to push and work to get our people what they need to do their jobs, and to support the community.\u201d",
      "Seated at a table in front of the council, Crowley opened her statements by restating her belief that the department is lacking the resources it needs to protect Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cWhen we fail to take care of our firefighters, we fail to take care of our communities,\u201d Crowley said.",
      "Bass dismissed Crowley, who remains with the department at a lower rank, for what the mayor deemed to be failures of leadership during Los Angeles\u2019 January fires, including the deadly Palisades Fire on the Los Angeles County coast.",
      "Bass lauded Crowley in the early hours of the fire, but said she later learned that an additional 1,000 firefighters could have been deployed on the day the Palisades Fire started. Bass also said Crowley refused to prepare a report on the fires.",
      "After her initial remarks, Crowley addressed some of those complaints, including the after-action report that was to be filed with the city\u2019s fire commission.",
      "\u201cI will set the record straight on multiple false accusations made against me,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI did not refuse an after-action report. This is a false accusation. During our discussions about an after-action report, I advised the fire commission about what was best.\u201d",
      "Crowley said she recommended working in collaboration the\u00a0Fire Safety Research Institute\u00a0(FSRI) on a post-fire report.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re already conducting an analysis of windstorm and wildfires,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cIn contrast to LAFD, FSRI has resources to conduct a thorough investigation\u2026 that will be independent, which is so important as we figure out a way to move forward.\u201d",
      "Crowley also addressed accusations about department staffing. She repeated statements that the department was limited because of fire engines that were sidelined for\u00a0maintenance. Crowley has said budget cuts impacted mechanics and mainly affected\u00a0fire engines and ambulances\u00a0that needed repair.",
      "\u201cOn the morning of the fire, I did not send home 1,000 firefighters who could have hopped on fire engines,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cWe did not have enough apparatus to put them on. Over 100 sat broken down in our maintenance yards.\u201d",
      "Crowley also refuted the mayor\u2019s claims that the chief did not notify her office about the windstorm and potentially life-threatening wildfire conditions.",
      "Firefighters union members spoke in support of Crowley during the meeting\u2019s public comment period.",
      "Several speakers expressed support for the mayor\u2019s decision, which took up the bulk of the meeting\u2019s public comment period.",
      "The last time the council heard an appeal like Crowley\u2019s was in 2005 for an animal services manager, according to the city clerk\u2019s office.",
      "The 10-vote bar was a tough one for Crowley to meet. Four council members stood with Bass when she announced the firing Feb. 21 at City Hall. Another member publicly announced support Tuesday.",
      "Only two have publicly stated opposition to the mayor\u2019s decision.",
      "Councilmember Traci Park, whose district includes Pacific Palisades, called for Crowley to appeal the decision, as had council member Monica Rodriguez, of the San Fernando Valley.",
      "\u201cAs a council, we also unanimously approved an outside, independent after-action review,\u201d Park said Tuesday. \u201cThe fire department and the city should not be investigating itself following the biggest disaster in our city\u2019s history, nor should it be investigated by a commission of political appointees.\u201d",
      "In a statement following the decision, Crowley described the decision as disappointing but expressed gratitude to those who showed her support.",
      "The LAFD also released a statement after the council hearing.",
      "\u201cThe Los Angeles City Fire Department is grateful for Chief Crowley and her leadership during the time she served as Fire Chief,\u201d the agency said. \u201cAs the City recovers from the devastating fires, Interim Fire Chief Villanueva will utilize his years of service to ensure collaboration between the LAFD, other City Departments and leaders as the focus is to move forward as one.\u201d",
      "The back-and-forth between the mayor and former chief began in the days after the fires started on Jan. 7, when Bass was on an\u00a0overseas trip\u00a0that she later said\u00a0was a mistake, and intensified with Bass\u2019 claims that Crowley did not warn her in advance about the high winds that fanned the Palisades and Eaton wildfires. The windstorm was\u00a0widely expected and publicized\u00a0days in advance of when the fires started in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.",
      "In a statement to NBC4, the LAFD said the department followed all standard preparation procedures.",
      "\u201cPrior to the Palisades Fire, the LAFD emailed two separate media advisories, conducted multiple live and recorded media interviews about the predicted extreme fire weather, and notified City Officials about the upcoming weather event,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Text messages\u00a0to and from Crowley offer some insight into coordination for the windstorm and fires. The messages include correspondence with the city emergency manager and LAPD chief outlining the plan for an emergency operations center ahead of the Palisades Fire and a message from Crowley to regional fire chiefs calling for \u201canything else you can send us\u201d after the fire started on the LA County coast.",
      "The mayor\u2019s office released a statement about the 350 pages of text messages.",
      "\u201cThese documents show that in the day leading up to the fires, Chief Crowley was not in text contact with the Mayor or any member of her staff regarding the coming weather event until after the fires had already broken out,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement.",
      "Crowley, elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of turmoil in a department consumed by complaints of rampant hazing, harassment and discrimination among its 3,400-member ranks, criticized the city for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs. Bass has said that the budget cuts did not have an impact on the LAFD\u2019s response to the wildfires.",
      "\u201cMy disappointment with this situation is that our chief, the chief chose the wrong time and the wrong place to raise an issue,\u201d Padilla said Tuesday. \u201cSpending time talking to the press to tell her side of the story, which I think is important, versus at the command center during the fires raises major concerns about what proper time should be. And it is because of that that I hope we recognize that this is a Mayor doing what is within her jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "Former Chief Deputy Ronnie Villanueva, a 41-year LAFD veteran, was announced as interim fire chief.",
      "Crowley has been with the LAFD for about 25 years, working her way up through the ranks of the department as a firefighter, paramedic, engineer, fire inspector, captain, battalion chief, assistant chief, deputy chief and chief deputy before earning the top job."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump is used to shocking critics with his approach to foreign policy. But his hard-line Ukraine tactics have this week unnerved some of his political allies on the far-right, too.",
      "The White House this week paused aid to Ukraine, which is fighting off Russia\u2019s invasion, after Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly berated President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders \u2014 often referred to as the \u201cDutch Trump\u201d because of his flamboyant blonde hair and anti-immigration politics \u2014 said Saturday he stood by Ukraine \u201cwith conviction.\u201d He reacted to Trump\u2019s Oval Office clash with Zelenskyy by posting to X that it was \u201cfascinating TV, but not necessarily the best way to end the war, gentlemen.\u201d",
      "Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Rally party, called the decision to halt aid \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201ccruel\u201d and reprehensible,\u201d speaking to the Le Figaro newspaper Tuesday.",
      "And Britain\u2019s Nigel Farage, a longtime friend and ally of Trump\u2019s, said on Tuesday that Vance was \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong\u201d after the vice president appeared to ridicule the idea of Britain sending peacekeepers to Ukraine.",
      "Only Britain and France have offered to send such a force, but Vance denied he was referring to those countries when he derided he idea of \u201c20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "Cue uproar in Britain, which lost 457 and 179 troops fighting U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan respectively.",
      "The comments are notable because these are Trump\u2019s natural allies in geopolitics: insurgents attacking the political establishment from the right with a mix of populism, extreme opposition to immigration, and, critics say, authoritarianism.",
      "Last month, Le Pen and Wilders were among a clutch of hard-right leaders who gathered for the \u201cMake Europe Great Again\u201d summit in Madrid. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a truly global tipping point,\u201d Le Pen told the audience. \u201cHurricane Trump is sweeping across the United States.\u201d",
      "Wilders called the American president \u201ca brother in arms.\u201d",
      "But the criticism also highlights the complex, confusing and often seemingly contradictory web of interests and viewpoints on the continent when it comes to Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Like many far-right figures in Europe, Le Pen, Farage and Wilders have all faced past accusations of being too close to the Kremlin \u2014 which they have all denied.",
      "They have also displayed varying degrees of skepticism when it comes to supporting Ukraine: Le Pen said she would oppose the use of French long-range missiles being used by Kyiv, Farage has argued that ending the war requires \u201cconcessions on both sides,\u201d and Wilders\u2019 People\u2019s Party, which leads the current government, opposed aid being given to the country at all.",
      "But these opinions seem to be shifting.",
      "Le Pen is trying to distance herself from her party\u2019s far-right roots, presenting a more mainstream image ahead of a 2027 presidential election she may well win. In a speech Saturday, she paid tribute to the \u201cUkrainian people\u201d who \u201cheroically resist the indefensible Russian aggression,\u201d Le Figaro reported. She said the crisis was a consequence of\u00a0 Europe\u2019s \u201csubmission\u201d to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile Wilders\u2019 People\u2019s Party has pivoted not only to supporting Ukraine aid \u2014 but also idea that Europe needs to gain military independence from Europe.",
      "\u201cWe ourselves must stand up for the safety of Europe and the Netherlands,\u201d the party posted to X after the Oval Office argument. \u201cWe will continue our support for Ukraine unabated and must invest more in defense.\u201d",
      "Farage meanwhile, despite his friendship with Trump, has found a political foe in adviser Elon Musk, who said he \u201cdid not have what it takes\u201d to lead Britain\u2019s reform party.",
      "His criticism of Vance appeared to come from a different place, however, echoing an outraged supporter base that saw the vice president as betraying British troops killed fighting American wars.",
      "\u201cSHOW RESPECT,\u201d the Sun tabloid wrote Wednesday. \u201cBrit heroes hit back at Vance after he forgot UK\u2019s 636 Iraq & Afghan war dead.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the PVV, Rassemblement National and Reform U.K. for comment on their statements."

      "The United States and Israel have rejected a Gaza Strip reconstruction plan that envisions the devastated enclave being fully rebuilt without displacing Palestinians, as envisioned under President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to transform the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Under the $53 billion reconstruction plan proposed by Egypt at an emergency summit in Cairo on Tuesday, Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in Israel's nearly a year and a half offensive in the enclave, would be rebuilt over the span of under six years.",
      "AI-labelled images released as part of the plan agreed at a summit that included representatives from across the 22-member Arab League, show modern housing developments and busy city streets, with the document outlining plans for tourist destinations, including hotel resorts.",
      "The proposal, which also includes plans for a commercial harbor and an airport, suggests it be funded by a variety of international sources, including the United Nations and international financial organizations, as well as from foreign and private sector investments.",
      "Egyptian President\u00a0Abdel Fattah\u00a0al-Sisi\u00a0said the proposal would enable the reconstruction of Gaza while ensuring Palestinians are able to \"stay on their land without displacement.\"",
      "The White House swiftly dismissed of the plan, with National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes saying late Tuesday that the proposal did not \"address the reality that Gaza is current uninhabitable.\" He said Trump stood by his \"vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" according to Reuters.",
      "According to local officials, more than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza in Israeli shelling and bombing. Most of the population has also been displaced and more than half of the infrastructure destroyed, including hospitals and schools, according to estimate from the United Nations.",
      "Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" sparked outrage across the region and around the world last month, with some analysts warning his plan to see Palestinians at least temporarily and possibly permanently displaced was tantamount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs echoed Trump's proposal on Tuesday, saying it provided an \"opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will.\"",
      "\"This should be encouraged,\" it added.",
      "While Israeli officials have repeatedly suggested Trump's plan would give Palestinians in Gaza the ability to leave the enclave freely \u2014 something they have not been able to do under Israel and Egypt's nearly two-decade long blockade on the territory \u2014 it has not expanded on whether they would just as easily be able to regain access to the territory.",
      "Israel's foreign ministry also condemned the Egyptian proposal's plan for a committee of independent Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza in preparation for the eventual return of the Palestinian Authority, accusing the Fatah-controlled government body of \"corruption\" and \"support for terrorism.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\u00a0commended the reconstruction plan in a statement also thanking Trump for his efforts surrounding the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Hamas, which has run the enclave for almost two decades and is a bitter rival of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the proposal embraced by Arab nations in a statement on Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday wades into the decadeslong debate about where to put nuclear waste by hearing a dispute over the federal government's decision to approve a storage facility in Texas.",
      "The nine justices will weigh whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission correctly allowed a company called Interim Storage Partners\u00a0to store spent nuclear fuel in Andrews County, Texas, for up to 40 years.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had faulted the NRC for its 2021 decision, prompting the Biden administration to appeal. The Trump administration has now taken over the case and is defending the commission's authority to approve private nuclear waste storage sites.",
      "State officials, including Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, are among those who have objected to the approval.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris, representing the Trump administration, said in court papers that Texas' legal argument, if adopted by the court, \"threatens to deprive the commission of authority to license the private storage of spent nuclear fuel in any location.\"",
      "\"That would grind the operations of nuclear reactors to a halt. Reactor operations automatically generate spent fuel; those operations cannot proceed if there is nowhere to store that spent fuel,\" she added.",
      "Abbott and others, including major landowner Fasken Land and Minerals, challenged the NRC decision in court, with the appeals court ruling both that they had a right to file suit and that the agency did not have the authority to issue the license.",
      "Texas officials say the NRC would allow up to 40,000 metric tons of waste to be stored above ground in the Permian Basin, which in addition to being a prominent oil field is also a source of water for surrounding communities.",
      "\"Nothing about this license is lawful,\" Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson said in court papers.",
      "The NRC maintains that under the Atomic Energy Act, it can order spent nuclear fuel to be transported across the country and held \"temporarily\" at a different, privately owned site from where the fuel was used.",
      "The agency also argues that Texas had no grounds to challenge the NRC decision directly at the appeals court. The state had not participated in the NRC proceedings, which began during the first Trump administration.",
      "The Texas litigation is the latest chapter in the long fight over where to store nuclear waste. A similar battle was waged for decades over plans to build a storage facility at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The project was effectively killed during the Obama administration in part because of the vocal opposition of the late Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who at the time was the Senate majority leader.",
      "Nielson noted in a court filing that under federal law, Yucca Mountain is the only authorized place where spent nuclear waste can be stored permanently.",
      "It is for now unclear whether the Trump administration will consider reviving the Yucca Mountain project."

    "story": [
      "President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s plan to\u00a0use\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to detain 30,000 immigrants has been\u00a0hitting\u00a0major legal, logistical and financial hurdles\u00a0ever since he surprised many in his own administration by announcing it. Now, as agencies spar over responsibility for operations there and over blame for what has gone wrong, there is a growing recognition within the administration that it was a political decision that is just not working.",
      "Among the major issues, especially as the Trump administration works to slash spending throughout the government, is the cost. Taking detained immigrants to Guant\u00e1namo means flying them there, and the administration has sometimes chosen to use military planes that are expensive to operate.",
      "On Tuesday of last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was on hand at Guant\u00e1namo when a military C-130 carrying nine immigrants landed at the base. The Defense Department calculates the cost per flight hour to operate a C-130 at $20,756, so for a trip of five to six hours, it cost the Pentagon $207,000 to $249,000 round trip, or $23,000 to $27,000 per detainee.",
      "Costs for those flights are lower when\u00a0charter planes that Immigration and Customs Enforcement typically uses for deportation flights\u00a0are employed in place of the military aircraft. But the administration has opted for military planes for reasons of optics, according to a defense official.\u00a0When charter planes are used, the operation is still a heavy logistical and financial lift, especially compared with keeping the detainees on the mainland.\u00a0Each flight includes at least one ICE official for every migrant, often more, as well as a medical team. ICE estimates the average cost of one of its regular charter flights at $8,577 per hour and the cost for \u201cspecial high-risk charter\u201d flights at $6,929 to $26,795 per hour, but those figures include \u201cflight crew, security personnel, an onboard medical professional and all associated aviation handling and overflight fees,\u201d which the Defense Department estimates for the C-130 do not.",
      "And the space planned to hold the 30,000 immigrants\u00a0is far from ready.\u00a0Tents built for that purpose lack air conditioning and running water and do not meet ICE standards for detention, according to the defense official and an additional defense official.",
      "The two U.S. defense officials and a congressional official\u00a0said views within the administration about how viable an option\u00a0Guant\u00e1namo is for holding\u00a0thousands of\u00a0immigrants have shifted, though Trump still wants the plan to move forward.\u00a0The\u00a0officials said it has become clear since Trump announced the Guant\u00e1namo plan that other options, including holding migrants at Fort Bliss, Texas, and other military bases in the United States would be\u00a0cheaper and more efficient. A scaled-down version of Trump\u2019s Guant\u00e1namo plan seems the likeliest outcome,\u00a0the\u00a0officials said.",
      "At the peak of its use during the Trump administration thus far,\u00a0Guant\u00e1namo held 178 immigrants, all Venezuelan men. On Feb. 20, the Trump administration cleared out all of those detainees, sending 177 back to Venezuela via Honduras and one back to detention inside the United States.\u00a0Though administration officials have consistently said the people being sent to Guant\u00e1namo are the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d 51 of the 178 were considered to be non-criminal, meaning they had committed no crime other than being present in the United States unlawfully, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. As of Monday, 20 people were being held there, according to two other defense officials.",
      "This article is based on interviews with nine\u00a0people familiar with the situation at Guant\u00e1namo and the dynamics inside the administration over it. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk with the media.",
      "The departments of Defense and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Asked for comment, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, provided a statement saying: \u201cPresident Trump received a resounding mandate from the American people to implement his agenda of mass deporting criminal illegal migrants. The Trump administration remains aligned on delivering on that mandate and re-establishing a no-nonsense enforcement of and respect for the immigration laws of the United States \u2014 ICE arrests skyrocketing 627% and border crossings nosediving by over 90% compared to the Biden era reflect the administration\u2019s commitment to keeping President Trump\u2019s promise to the American people.\u201d",
      "Surprise, then a power struggle",
      "Trump\u2019s\u00a0plan\u00a0had problems\u00a0from the moment he announced it on Jan. 29, when it was far from finalized.",
      "Trump took many top officials in his administration by surprise when he made the announcement at a bill-signing ceremony. It was the first some had\u00a0heard\u00a0that a decision had even been made to send migrants to Guant\u00e1namo,\u00a0according to a DHS official and the congressional official.\u00a0No plans\u00a0for\u00a0how detaining 30,000 migrants at Guant\u00e1namo would work had been crafted by the agencies that would play roles in it, namely\u00a0DHS\u00a0and the Pentagon, according to the congressional official and the two defense officials.",
      "The naval base was not close to being equipped to hold the 30,000 migrants Trump said it would. At the time of Trump\u2019s announcement, it could hold only a tiny fraction of that, according to two former Biden administration officials familiar with the capacity limits.",
      "A power struggle between the military and\u00a0ICE,\u00a0which is part of DHS, quickly ensued over who would be responsible for interacting with migrants once they arrived at Guant\u00e1namo, according to the two defense officials and a DHS official.",
      "Facing a budget shortfall even before Trump was sworn in, ICE has been struggling to meet the stepped-up pace of arrests and deportations Trump wants. The acting director the administration put in place\u00a0was reassigned last month, after Trump and border czar Tom Homan expressed anger that the number of people being deported is not higher.",
      "Oversight of the operation fell to ICE\u2019s Miami field office because members of the military cannot legally interact with immigrants in detention, the two defense officials noted. But\u00a0staffing there was in short supply,\u00a0the congressional official and the DHS official said.\u00a0ICE leadership needed the agents who would be sent to oversee detainees at Guant\u00e1namo back on the mainland making arrests.",
      "The military,\u00a0concerned\u00a0that it would be blamed if the effort failed, initially surged resources to Guant\u00e1namo,\u00a0according to the two defense officials. The Pentagon sent roughly 1,110 troops and support personnel along with equipment to support the mission even though it had not yet received clear policy guidance\u00a0outlining its role, the officials said.",
      "Members of the military started setting up thousands of tents but without clear guidance about what the tents need\u00a0to meet\u00a0ICE\u00a0standards for holding immigrants,\u00a0the\u00a0two\u00a0defense officials said.\u00a0They said that the\u00a0military had expected to get a memorandum of understanding with details about the tents as early as last Friday but that it still has not received specific guidance. The military does not have the money to pay for those changes or upgrades, and no one has ordered it to make or pay for them\u00a0yet,\u00a0the officials said.\u00a0(Under long-standing federal court settlements, immigration detention cannot be punitive, and it must adhere to certain humanitarian standards.)",
      "DHS\u00a0sent\u00a0only\u00a0one staffer\u00a0to\u00a0oversee detention operations\u00a0and seven contractors when the first migrants started arriving at Guant\u00e1namo, and it did not send more until after the first three planes of migrants had arrived,\u00a0the two defense officials said.",
      "With a continued lack of resources, the military started bringing in more staffing to support the mission, including cooks, doctors and administrative staffers,\u00a0the defense officials said.",
      "For several weeks, DHS did not send any interpreters to Guant\u00e1namo, and members of the military provided those services for\u00a0immigrants\u00a0there, the two defense officials said.",
      "The memorandum of understanding in the works would cover operations at Guant\u00e1namo going\u00a0forward,\u00a0one of the defense officials said. But both defense officials said\u00a0it is unclear who will reimburse the military for the money it\u00a0has\u00a0spent on the effort so far, including flights.",
      "Beyond the problem of the cost of the military flights, the explanation some members of Congress have received from military commanders about the Defense Department\u2019s rationale for the legality of those flights\u2019 carrying immigrants \u201cseemed like reverse engineering them to be legal,\u201d said a congressional official who spoke to officials with ICE and the military\u2019s Southern Command.",
      "Some congressional Democrats believe the military flights rest on shaky legal ground.\u00a0Typically, the congressional official said, the Defense Department\u2019s standard procedure is to render an opinion that an activity is legal before it begins. In this case, the congressional official said, the Pentagon is relying on a DHS memo that says DHS legal counsel has interpreted its own policies to allow the military to conduct those flights. The Pentagon has yet to generate its own interpretation of that law that has been communicated to any of the military forces involved in the Guant\u00e1namo effort, the official said.",
      "Three weeks ago, amid the issues at the base, a\u00a0bipartisan group of\u00a0congressional\u00a0staffers\u00a0planned\u00a0to travel to Guant\u00e1namo to survey the operation.\u00a0But the trip was abruptly canceled by\u00a0Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,\u00a0who said the area was not ready to accept the delegation, according to a congressional aide who planned to attend. The trip has not been rescheduled.",
      "Hegseth himself did visit the base last week, bringing along friendly media: his former Fox News colleague Laura Ingraham."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its stake in two Panama Canal ports to U.S. and Swiss investors amid pressure from the Trump administration over the ports\u2019 ties to China.",
      "CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday.",
      "President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal.",
      "Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "\u201cMy administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S.",
      "In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President\u00a0Jimmy Carter\u00a0and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump told Congress on Tuesday. \u201cWe gave it to Panama and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Both China and Panama deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution.",
      "\u201cChina supports Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cChina has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Crist\u00f3bal port on the Atlantic side.",
      "It does not affect the company\u2019s ports in China.",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release.",
      "The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.",
      "Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state.",
      "Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a\u00a0bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory\u00a0by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047.",
      "Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S.",
      "The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency.",
      "Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city.",
      "The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."

      "The movie \u2014 which shows former \"Better Things\" star Mikey Madison portray a sex worker nicknamed Ani who falls in love with the son of a Russian oligarch \u2014 seemed to be somewhat of an underdog before the awards ceremony began. But by the end of the 97th Academy Awards, the spotlight was on \"Anora\" as director Sean Baker made history winning for original screenplay, film editing, directing and best picture. The feat was so impressive that Baker tied Walt Disney, who also took home four Oscars on the same night in 1953, according to Variety. However, Disney won for four different films, meaning Baker has the distinction of being the only filmmaker to win four Oscars for one movie.",

      "The 25-year-old seemed shocked when her name was announced by two-time Oscar winner Emma Stone, who presented the best actress category.",

      "\u201cI knew I had to finish what I started,\u201d the man tells Collins, expressing that he wanted revenge for the people who died building Paradise and for them not being invited into the bunker.",
      "The man was able to kill the president by sneaking into his room at night and hitting him over the head with a large rotary drill bit that was seen on display at the library.",
      "While still conscious, President Bradford attempted to leave a sign for Collins by drawing an X with his blood on his cigarettes. As viewers saw earlier, one of the cigarettes contained a code that led to a library book with secret information about how to get out of Paradise.",

      "Parton says she and Dean are still a team in 1997",
      "In a 1997 interview with Out Magazine in which she promoted her latest collection of dance club remixes, Parton explained that she and her longtime companion, Judy Ogle, was \"just an old maid\" and not her lover.",
      "\"People think because she\u2019s never married that she must be a lesbian, and because we\u2019ve been together, that we must be lovers. But the fact is, I think Judy would rather be called a lesbian than an old maid,\" she quipped. \"If I was gay, I\u2019d certainly never find a finer person than Judy as a mate. I\u2019m as close to her just about as I am with (my) husband.\u201d",

      "The Out interview, along with many others, were reported in the 2017 book \u201cNot Dumb and Not Blonde: Dolly in Conversation.\u201d The book \u2014\u00a0which cites Parton and Randy Schmidt as authors \u2014 collected and published interviews with Parton dating as far back as 1967.",
      "Parton and Dean renew their vows",
      "In May 2016, Parton and Dean got the wedding they planned years ago, but never got to have. The private affair was held at their Nashville-area home, and she said they \"just had fun with it.\"",
      "\u201cI got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you\u2019ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,\u201d Parton told Rolling Stone. \u201cWe had a few family and friends around. We didn\u2019t plan anything big at all because we didn\u2019t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed.\"",
      "Parton also said that their vow renewal inspired a large portion of her album \"Plain and Simple,\" which was released that August.",
      "Parton surprises Dean with a racy Playboy look for his birthday",
      "In honor of her husband's birthday, Parton donned a throwback look that she knew he would love. In July 2021, she put on a Playboy bunny costume in his honor.",
      "\u201cRemember sometime back I said I\u00a0was going to pose on the cover of Playboy Magazine\u00a0when I was 75? Well, I\u2019m 75 and they don\u2019t have a magazine anymore,\u201d she said in a\u00a0video at the time. \u201cBut my husband always loved the original cover of 'Playboy' so I was trying to think of something to do to make him happy.\u201d",
      "Parton was the first country star to pose for the now-defunct magazine, appearing on the cover in 1978. According to her\u00a0official website, her contract at the time had \u201cvery specific parameters that did not include nudity,\u201d but she still wore the classic bunny suit.",
      "In her 2021 video, she said that she had a new cover made with her fresh outfit and \"the new Dolly.\"",
      "\u201cWell, the\u00a0old\u00a0new Dolly,\u201d she said, good-naturedly. \u201cIn the first one, I was kind of a little butterball in that one. Well, I\u2019m string cheese now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut he\u2019ll probably think I\u2019m cream cheese,\u201d Parton said with a wink. \u201cI hope!\u201d",
      "Parton releases her 2023 rock album, with Dean's support",
      "The singer recently released her newest album titled \"Rockstar.\" On \"What Would Dolly Do? Radio,\" she spoke more about her husband's reaction to hearing the album.",
      "\"I played him the whole album and he said, which to me was the greatest compliment in the world, he said, 'You know, it\u2019s pretty good,'\" she said. \"That would be like anybody else saying, 'Oh, that\u2019s best I ever heard. That\u2019s just so fantastic.'\"",
      "She said Dean has always been honest with her about his opinions.",
      "\"I had done a couple of things in the past, just some rock things. He said, 'It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK,'\" Parton added. \"He\u2019s very honest. We have such a great relationship. I know not to ask him if I don\u2019t want an honest answer.\"",
      "Parton announces Dean's death",
      "On March 3, a statement was shared on Parton's Instagram announcing the death of her husband.",
      "\u201cCarl Dean, husband of Dolly Parton, passed away March 3rd in Nashville at the age of 82. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending. He was survived by his siblings Sandra and Donnie,\u201d the statement first reads, followed by a personal message by Parton.",
      "\u201cCarl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can\u2019t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years,\u201d the singer wrote. \u201cThank you for your prayers and sympathy.\u201d"

      "\u201cI don\u2019t share your opinion. For me, the heart of this movie was not Mexico. We weren\u2019t making a film about a country. We were making a film about four women. And these women could have been Russian, could have been Dominican, could have been Black from Detroit, could have been from Israel, could have been from Gaza,\" she noted. \"And these women are still very universal women that are struggling every day, trying to survive systemic oppression and trying to find their most authentic voices. So I will stand by that.\"",
      "Salda\u00f1a ended her statement by welcoming further discussion on the topic.",
      "\"But I\u2019m also always open to sit down with all of my Mexican brothers and sisters, with love and respect, (to have) a great conversation on how \u2018Emilia\u2019 could have been done better. I have no problem. I welcome it,\u201d she said.",
      "Since its release in November 2024, \"Emilia Perez\" has won several awards at awards shows like the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, SAG Awards and BAFTAs.",
      "The movie also ignited controversy on multiple fronts, including on matters of Mexican representation.",
      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d is set in Mexico, but most of the lead actors aren\u2019t from Mexico. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays Emilia, is from Spain; Salda\u00f1a is from the U.S. and has Dominican and Puerto Rican ancestry; and Selena Gomez is from the U.S. with Mexican and Italian heritage.",
      "Only supporting cast member Adriana Paz, who plays Emilia\u2019s lover, Epifan\u00eda, is from Mexico. Paz, calling director Audiard a \"genius,\" defended the movie in an interview with\u00a0IndieWire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said.",
      "Director Audiard told a reporter he \"didn't study much\" about Mexico to make the film, per a translation done by NBC News.",
      "According to the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, the majority of filming took place on a sound stage in Paris, with five days of exterior shots in Mexico.",
      "The movie also started debate about the depiction of its main character. Gasc\u00f3n plays a cartel leader who undergoes gender reassignment surgery to live freely as Emilia P\u00e9rez, her true identity.",
      "Some viewers argued that \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d misrepresents trans people. LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD described the film as a \u201cstep backward for trans representation,\u201d adding that it \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n defended her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character against accusations that the depiction was transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d",
      "Then, weeks before the Oscars, Gasc\u00f3n herself was the target of backlash when tweets she posted in 2020 resurfaced containing racist and Islamophobic sentiments. Gasc\u00f3n later issued an apology.",
      "In January 2025, Salda\u00f1a responded to her cast mate's controversy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still processing everything that has transpired in the last couple of days. It makes me really sad because I don\u2019t support and I don\u2019t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group,\" she said during a Q&A session for the film, per The Hollywood Reporter."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China and Canada moved swiftly on Tuesday to retaliate against newly imposed U.S. tariffs, announcing their own levies on U.S. goods that could further disrupt the United States\u2019 trade with its top three trading partners.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for\u00a0more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.",
      "China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both \u201ctariff and nontariff measures.\u201d",
      "The new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.",
      "China says that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.\u201d",
      "Lin also said that China had \u201ctaken strong measures\u201d to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which President Donald Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the United States was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.",
      "In addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.",
      "Beijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.",
      "The combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by President Joe Biden.",
      "Canada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155\u00a0billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in U.S. goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.",
      "Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.",
      "\u201cBecause of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cTariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.\u201d",
      "Trump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.",
      "While precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid that is then smuggled into the United States, Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.",
      "According to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.",
      "Trudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in a further drop of 97% in fentanyl seizures from Canada from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.",
      "The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.",
      "In Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.",
      "Chinese leaders and lawmakers gather in Beijing this week for the country\u2019s biggest political event of the year, the National People\u2019s Congress, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party will signal its priorities and goals for the year, including its approach to the Trump administration.",
      "Though China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, \u201cTrump\u2019s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus\u201d and the U.S. farming sector \u201cshould start to feel the pinch,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.",
      "\u201cSounds like it\u2019s telling the U.S. that \u2018we\u2019re really going to hit you hard if you don\u2019t stop,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "In Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d that Canada would \u201crespond like they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the United States, as well as shipments of nickel, which \u201cwill shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI apologize, but he\u2019s giving us no choice.\u201d"

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against his critics and accused the media of working with the \u201cdeep state\u201d as he rejected the establishment of a court-appointed inquiry into the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks.",
      "In a speech at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Netanyahu, without providing any evidence, suggested the findings would be \u201cpredetermined\u201d and told lawmakers it was \u201cimportant and crucial to investigate in depth the events of Oct. 7 and what led up to it,\u201d but  thought a court-led probe would be biased.",
      "\u201cWhat do you think? That we\u2019re children?\u201d he shouted into a microphone as some his fellow politicians jeered and shouted at him during Monday night's debate.",
      "Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice ruled in December that Netanyahu\u2019s government\u00a0should hold a Cabinet hearing on whether to form a state commission of inquiry\u00a0to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Hamas-led attacks, looking at why the country\u2019s military was unable to prevent the deadly assault.",
      "But it has since agreed to requests from the government to delay updates to the court about its stance on the creation of such an inquiry.",
      "Lawmakers, including former war Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, have long called for a state commission to be set up.",
      "Banging on the podium in the Knesset, Netanyahu acknowledged that the \u201cpublic demands the truth\u201d about the Hamas attacks and he called for the formation of a commission that would \u201cinvestigate everything,\u201d including alleged leaks from Cabinet meetings and confidential parliamentary sessions.",
      "He went on to blast the media, accusing news outlets of  \u201cfull cooperation with the deep state\u201d and of creating \u201cscandals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep state and the media didn\u2019t work in the United States, and it won\u2019t work here,\u201d he said, aping the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the idea that clandestine networks operate within governments, acting to manipulate or control policy.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s rivals were quick to condemn his comments. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the events of Oct. 7 would \u201calways belong\u201d to the Israeli prime minister, adding that \u201cthere was never a government here that had so many reasons to ask for forgiveness.\u201d",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the debate reflected a \u201ctotal disconnect\u201d by a \u201cdisastrous government.\u201d",
      "After conducting its own investigation into the deadly attacks, Israel\u2019s military acknowledged last month that it had misjudged Hamas\u2019 intentions and underestimated the militant group\u2019s capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.",
      "More than 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "However, many Israelis believe the failures surrounding the attacks extend beyond the military and Netanyahu has faced calls to take responsibility for his country\u2019s apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "At least 65% of Israelis said they believed the most appropriate method to investigate the attacks was a State Commission of Inquiry, according to a recent poll conducted by the Jerusalem-based Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research.",
      "Surveyed between from Jan. 28 to Feb. 2, just 17% of the 604 Jewish and 151 Arab respondents said they supported the idea of a government-appointed commission of inquiry.",
      "Netanyahu has nonetheless maintained that he will answer difficult questions, but only after the war that has consumed the Middle East for almost a-year-and-a-half comes to an end.",
      "His outburst came amid growing fears over the future of the fragile ceasefire between his government and Hamas, and as Israel faces mounting criticism for halting the entry of aid and goods into the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar doubled down on that decision Tuesday, blaming Hamas for the pause \u2014 which came as families across Gaza marked the month of Ramadan \u2014 after the militant group refused to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire.",

      "Several senior Russian missile specialists have visited Iran over the past year as the Islamic Republic has deepened its defense cooperation with Moscow, a Reuters review of travel records and employment data indicates.",
      "The seven weapons experts were booked to travel from Moscow to Tehran aboard two flights on April 24 and September 17 last year, according to documents detailing the two group bookings as well as the passenger manifest for the second flight.",
      "The booking records include the men\u2019s passport numbers, with six of the seven having the prefix \u201c20.\u201d That denotes a passport used for official state business, issued to government officials on foreign work trips and military personnel stationed abroad, according to an edict published by the Russian government and a document on the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s website.",
      "Reuters was unable to determine what the seven were doing in Iran.",
      "A senior Iranian defense ministry official said Russian missile experts had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites last year, including two underground facilities, with some of the visits taking place in September. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss security matters, didn\u2019t identify the sites.",
      "A Western defense official, who monitors Iran\u2019s defense cooperation with Russia and also requested anonymity, said an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base, about 9 miles west of the port of Amirabad on Iran\u2019s Caspian Sea coast, in September.",
      "Reuters couldn\u2019t establish if the visitors referred to by the officials included the Russians on the two flights.",
      "The seven Russians identified by Reuters all have senior military backgrounds, with two ranked colonel and two lieutenant-colonel, according to a review of Russian databases containing information about citizens\u2019 jobs or places of work, including tax, phone and vehicle records.",
      "Two are experts in air-defense missile systems, three specialize in artillery and rocketry, while one has a background in advanced weapons development and another has worked at a missile-testing range, the records showed. Reuters was unable to establish whether all are still working in those roles as the employment data ranged from 2021 to 2024.",
      "Their flights to Tehran came at a precarious time for Iran, which found itself drawn into a tit-for-tat battle with arch-foe Israel that saw both sides mount military strikes on each other in April and October.",
      "Reuters contacted all the men by phone: five of them denied they had been to Iran, denied they worked for the military or both, while one declined to comment and one hung up.",
      "Iran\u2019s defense and foreign ministries declined to comment for this article, as did the public relations office of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite force that oversees Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The Russian defense ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cooperation between the two countries, whose leaders signed a 20-year military pact in Moscow in January, has already influenced Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, with large numbers of Iranian-designed Shahed drones deployed on the battlefield.",
      "Rockets and artillery",
      "The flight booking information for the seven travellers was shown to Reuters by Hooshyaran-e Vatan, a group of activist hackers opposed to the Iranian government. The hackers said the seven were travelling with VIP status.",
      "Reuters corroborated the information with the Russian passenger manifest for the September flight, which was provided by a source with access to Russian state databases. The news agency was unable to access a manifest for the earlier flight, so couldn\u2019t verify that the five Russian specialists booked on it actually made the trip.",
      "Denis Kalko, 48, and 46-year-old Vadim Malov were among the five Russian weapons experts whose seats were booked as a group on the April flight, the records showed.",
      "Kalko worked at the defense ministry\u2019s Academy for Military Anti-Aircraft Defense, tax records for 2021 show. Malov worked for a military unit that trains anti-aircraft missile forces, according to car ownership records for 2024.",
      "Andrei Gusev, 45, Alexander Antonov, 43, and Marat Khusainov, 54, were also booked on the April flight. Gusev is a lieutenant-colonel who works as deputy head of the faculty of General Purpose Rockets and Artillery Munitions at the defense ministry\u2019s Penza Artillery Engineering Institute, according to a 2021 news item on the institute\u2019s website.",
      "Antonov has worked at the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Defense Ministry, according to car registration records from 2024, while bank data shows Khusainov, a colonel, has worked at the Kapustin Yar missile-testing range.",
      "One of the two passengers onboard the second flight to Tehran in September was Sergei Yurchenko, 46, who has also worked at the Rocket and Artillery Directorate, according to undated mobile phone records. His passport number had the prefix \u201c22;\u201d Reuters was unable to determine what that signified though, according to the government edict on passports, it isn\u2019t used for private citizens or diplomats.",
      "The other passenger on the September flight was 46-year-old Oleg Fedosov. Residence records give his address as the office of the Directorate of Advanced Inter-Service Research and Special Projects. That is a branch of the defense ministry tasked with developing weapons systems of the future.",
      "Fedosov had previously flown from Tehran to Moscow in October 2023, according to Russian border crossing records viewed by Reuters. On that occasion, as he did for the September 2024 flight, Fedosov used his passport reserved for official state business, the records showed."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its stake in two Panama Canal ports to U.S. and Swiss investors amid pressure from the Trump administration over the ports\u2019 ties to China.",
      "CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday.",
      "President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal.",
      "Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "\u201cMy administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S.",
      "In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President\u00a0Jimmy Carter\u00a0and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump told Congress on Tuesday. \u201cWe gave it to Panama and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Both China and Panama deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution.",
      "\u201cChina supports Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cChina has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Crist\u00f3bal port on the Atlantic side.",
      "It does not affect the company\u2019s ports in China.",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release.",
      "The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index.",
      "Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state.",
      "Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a\u00a0bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory\u00a0by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047.",
      "Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S.",
      "The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency.",
      "Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city.",
      "The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."

One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",

      "The 88-year-old pontiff, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had two respiratory crises Monday  in a setback to his recovery.",
      "On Tuesday, he was breathing with just the help of supplemental oxygen after respiratory crises a day earlier, but resumed using a ventilation mask at night, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization began Feb. 14 and is the longest of his 12-year papacy.",
      "Francis\u2019 treatment continues as the Vatican prepares for Lent, the solemn period beginning with Ash Wednesday and leading up to Easter on April 20. A cardinal has been designated to take Francis\u2019 place at Vatican celebrations, with a traditional service and procession in Rome",
      "On Ash Wednesday, observant Catholics receive a sign of the cross in ashes on their foreheads, a gesture that underscores human mortality. It is an obligatory day of fasting and abstinence for Catholics that signals the start of Christianity\u2019s most penitent season.",
      "Vatican prepares for Lent without Francis",
      "The pope was also supposed to attend a spiritual retreat this coming weekend with the rest of the Holy See hierarchy. On Tuesday, the Vatican said the retreat would go ahead without Francis but in \u201cspiritual communion\u201d with him. The theme, selected weeks ago and well before Francis got sick, was \u201cHope in eternal life.\u201d",
      "Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. The accumulation of secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",
      "Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off intubation or the use of more invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It\u2019s not clear if he has provided any instructions on the limits of his care if he declines seriously or loses consciousness.",
      "Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive \u201cordinary\u201d care such as hydration and nutrition, but \u201cextraordinary\u201d or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life."

      "BEIJING \u2014 China is keeping its economic growth target at \u201caround 5%\u201d for 2025 despite a looming trade war with the United States and other headwinds.",
      "The target for GDP growth was announced Wednesday in a report being presented by Premier Li Qiang at the opening session of the National People\u2019s Congress, the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature. It reflects the government\u2019s hopes to stabilize but not supercharge growth in challenging economic times.",
      "The IMF has projected China\u2019s economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "\u201cA target of around 5% is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver,\u201d the government report said.",
      "The report offered some details on previously announced plans to step up stimulus for the sluggish economy this year. It said the government would adopt a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including an increase in deficit spending from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy.",
      "It said the government would issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year.",
      "Across-the-board tariffs imposed on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment.",
      "China\u2019s ruling Communist Party signaled in December that it would boost stimulus this year. The U.S. tariffs have made that task more urgent, because they could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets.",
      "At the same time, Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market. He is pushing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn\u2019t beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "That has remained the overarching long-term economic goal of the Communist Party, though it has enacted various measures since September in a possible shift in emphasis toward shoring up growth in the short term.",
      "The government has been giving rebates to consumers who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones and to businesses that upgrade their machinery and equipment. The party also announced in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government, following the party\u2019s leadership, is expected to borrow more this year, spend more on the rebate program and possibly increase pensions and health care benefits. The question is whether it will be enough to stabilize the economy and reach its target for growth."

      "The first comprehensive account illustrating how mass sexual violence is being wielded as a weapon of war against children inside the northeast African nation found that more than 200 children had been raped since the start of last year, although the authors stressed that this was only a small fraction of the total number of cases.",

      "Four 1-year-olds were among those who survived the assaults and another 16 survivors were children under the age of 5, the report said. Of the reported 221 cases of child rape, 66% of the victims were girls, while 33% were boys, it added.",
      "The number of violations recorded against Sudanese children was 16% higher in 2024 than in 2023, which had already seen an increase of 473% from 2022 when the war broke out, the report said.",
      "The report contained distressing details that highlighted the gravity of the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cAfter nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,\u201d read one testimony by Omnia, an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.",
      "Nearly two years of war between Sudan's armed forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler,\u00a0Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy,\u00a0Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have left more than 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance.",

      "But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "More than 12 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of people have been reportedly killed, according to the U.N.",
      "While both sides have been accused of extensive human rights violations, a U.N. fact-finding mission in October found that the RSF was responsible for committing sexual violence on a large scale in areas under its control, including gang rapes, abductions and sexual slavery.",
      "In January, the United States determined that the RSF had committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "UNICEF, which has been providing safe spaces for children through emergency response rooms set up by local activists, said in the report that the outcome of sexual crimes against children was \u201cdevastating\u201d due to the fact that victims have \u201cfew places to turn to for medical help.\u201d",
      "Women and girls are fleeing their homes and families to other cities where they end up becoming internally displaced and continue to face high risk of sexual violence, the report added.",
      "\u201cWidespread sexual violence in Sudan has instilled terror in people, especially children,\u201d Russell said, calling on all parties to the conflict to put an end to the violations.",
      "\u201cThese scars of war are immeasurable and long-lasting,\u201d she added."

      "\u201cThe DPRK is also planning to carefully examine the option for increasing the actions threatening the security of the enemy at the strategic level to cope with the fact that the deployment of U.S. strategic assets in the Korean Peninsula has become a vicious habit and adversely affects the security of the DPRK,\u201d she said, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "Her statement suggests North Korea may test-launch powerful missiles designed to strike the mainland U.S. or American military bases in the region, observers say.",

      "On Sunday, the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group arrived in South Korea, the latest temporary deployment of a U.S. strategic asset aimed at displaying the firmness of the U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of North Korean threats and strengthening interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets.

      "Experts say Kim Jong Un is not likely to embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider returning to diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country\u2019s current booming cooperation with Russia.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018 to 2019 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea."

      "But the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.",
      "The president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)",

NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.",
      "Biden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.",
      "The disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.",
