She has been a critic of the Israeli government and an advocate for Palestinians throughout the two-year war in Gaza.",
      "After the board\u2019s statement canceling Abdel-Fattah\u2019s appearance, other speakers on the program \u2014 including British novelist Zadie Smith and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2014 withdrew from their events too. The Festival\u2019s director quit Tuesday, citing her objections to the board\u2019s decision to disinvite Abdel-Fattah.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The jury trial for Nathan Chasing Horse, the former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls, is expected to begin Tuesday in Las Vegas.",
      "Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of his victims over two decades. Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a minor, first degree kidnapping of a minor and the use of a minor in producing pornography.",
      "The case sent shock waves across Indian Country when he was arrested and indicted in early 2023. There were many setbacks and delays, but the case finally proceeded to trial after prosecutors added allegations that he filmed himself having sex with a child.",
      "Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse proclaimed himself to be a Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies.",

      "One victim was 14 years old when she approached him hoping he would heal her mother, who was diagnosed with cancer. Chasing Horse previously had treated the victim\u2019s breathing issues and her mother\u2019s spider bite, according to a court transcript. He allegedly told her the spirits wanted her to give up her virginity in exchange for her mother\u2019s health. He allegedly had sex with her and said her mother would die if she told anyone, according to the victim\u2019s testimony to the grand jury.",
      "The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony.",

In October 2024, the charges were refiled with new allegations that he recorded himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14.",
      "Prosecutors have said the recordings, made in 2010 or 2011, were found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "Jury selection will begin Tuesday. The trial is expected to last four weeks, and prosecutors plan to call 18 witnesses. A week before the trial, Chasing Horse attempted to fire his private defense attorney, saying his lawyer hadn't come to visit him. Judge Jessica Peterson removed Chasing Horse from the courtroom when he tried to interrupt her, and she denied his request.",

      "\u201cThere are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,\" she said. \u201cAnd the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department.\"",

      "It was Glaser's second time hosting the show. She was quickly rehired after getting strong reviews in her first outing last year. She was hired the first time after the ruthless roast she gave the attendees of the Netflix roast of Tom Brady. She's been kinder on the Globes, but her jokes still had some bite.",
      "She made the obligatory joke about Leonardo DiCaprio dating young women.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve worked with every great director. You\u2019ve won three Golden Globes and an Oscar,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "References to President Donald Trump\u2019s two impeachments have been removed from his photo portrait display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \u201cAmerican Presidents\u201d exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\u201cThe museum is beginning its planned update of the America\u2019s Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\u201d the gallery statement said. \u201cFor some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist\u2019s name.\u201d",

      "For now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.",
      "And, the gallery statement noted, \u201cThe history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \u201cPresidential Walk of Fame\u201d featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 with the exception of Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \u201cby far, the worst President in American History\u201d who \u201cbrought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\u201d",

      "Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s ragtag revolutionary saga \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d took top honors at Sunday\u2019s 83rd Golden Globes in the comedy category, while Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's Shakespeare drama \u201cHamnet\u201d pulled off an upset over \u201cSinners\u201d to win best film, drama.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film, comedy, supporting female actor for Teyana Taylor and best director and best screenplay for Anderson. He became just the second filmmaker to sweep director, screenplay and film, as a producer, at the Globes. Only Oliver Stone, for \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d managed the same feat.",
      "In an awards ceremony that went almost entirely as expected, the night's final award was the most surprising. While \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d has been the clear front-runner this awards season, most have pegged Ryan Coogler's Jim Crow-era vampire thriller as its closest competition.",
      "But \u201cHamnet,\u201d a speculative drama about William and Agnes Shakespeare based on Maggie O\u2019Farrell's bestseller, won in the dramatic category shortly after its star, Jessie Buckley, won best female actor in a drama.",
      "It was a banner night for Warner Bros., the studio behind \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and \u201cSinners.\u201d Warner Bros. Discovery has agreed to be sold to Netflix in an $83 billion deal. Paramount Skydance has appealed to shareholders with its own rival offer.",
      "In his speech after winning best director, Anderson praised Warner co-chief Michael DeLuca.",
      "\u201cHe said he wanted to run a studio one day and let filmmakers make whatever they want,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get \u2018Sinners.\u2019 That\u2019s how you get a \u2018Weapons.' That\u2019s how you get \u2018One Battle After Another.\u2019\u201d",
      "The final awards brought to, or near, the stage a handful of the most talented filmmakers together in Anderson, Zhao and Coogler \u2014 plus Steven Spielberg, a producer of \u201cHamnet.\u201d Regardless of who won what, it was a heartening moment of solidarity between them, with a shared sense of purpose. Zhao fondly recalled being at Sundance Labs with Coogler when they were each starting out.",
      "\u201cAs students, let\u2019s keep our hearts open and let\u2019s keep seeing each other and allowing each other to be seen,\u201d said Zhao, while Coogler smiled from the front row.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d won for best score and cinematic and box-office achievement. The win for box office and cinematic achievement, over franchise films like \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d was notable for Coogler's film, a movie that some reports labeled a qualified success on its release.",
      "Yet \u201cSinners\u201d ultimately grossed $278 million domestically and $368 million worldwide, making it highest grossing original film in 15 years.",
      "\u201cI just want to thank the audience for showing up,\u201d said Coogler. \u201cIt\u2019s means the world.\u201d",
      "Coming off years of scandal and subsequent rehabilitation, the Globes and host Nikki Glaser put on a star-studded ceremony that saw wins for the streaming sensation \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d (best animated film, song), a meta triumph for Seth Rogen\u2019s \u201cThe Studio\u201d and an inaugural award for podcasting that went to Amy Poehler\u2019s \u201cGood Hang.\u201d",
      "Many of the Oscar favorites won. Timothee Chalamet won his first Golden Globe, for \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d after four previous nominations. The 30-year-old is poised to win his first Oscar. Fellow nominees like Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney stood to applaud his win.",
      "\u201cMy dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up: Always be grateful for what you have,\u201d said Chalamet. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say those moments didn\u2019t make this moment that much sweeter.\u201d",
      "The Globes, held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, got underway with a pointedly political opening from host Nikki Glaser and an early award for the night\u2019s favorite, \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Emceeing the show for the second straight year, Glaser kicked off the show with self-aware satire.",

      "Bob Weir, guitarist, singer and founding member of the Grateful Dead, has died at age 78",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Bob Weir, the guitarist and singer who as an essential member of the Grateful Dead helped found the sound of the San Francisco counterculture of the 1960s and kept it alive through decades of endless tours and marathon jams, has died. He was 78.",
      "Weir\u2019s death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\u201d a statement on his Instagram posted Saturday said. \u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "Weir joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d",
      "After Garcia\u2019s death, he would be the Dead's most recognizable face. In the decades since, he kept playing with other projects that kept alive the band's music and legendary fan base, including Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cFor over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\u201d the Instagram statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead\u2019s 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia\u2019s in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",

      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \u201cain't no time to hate\u201d and \u201cnot all who wander are lost.\u201d",

      "The American Film Institute Awards has gathered its 2026 honorees for a special luncheon in Beverly Hills",
      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- If the American Film Institute Awards stands for anything, it\u2019s that everyone in the room \u2014 from Leonardo DiCaprio and Ryan Coogler to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Ariana Grande \u2014 leaves feeling like a winner.",
      "That spirit was on full display Friday as the AFI Awards gathered its 2026 honorees for an invitation-only luncheon in Beverly Hills, where the institute once again celebrated the collaborative nature of film and television by honoring creative teams \u2014 in front of and behind the camera.",
      "Inside the ballroom, there were no acceptance speeches in the traditional sense and no suspense over envelopes. Instead, AFI\u2019s ceremony unfolded as a series of thoughtfully written tributes: eloquent rationales for each honored film and television program, followed by brief clips designed to place the year\u2019s work within a broader cultural and artistic context.",
      "AFI President Bob Gazzale spoke in front of star-filled room, ensuring there were no losers with only shared recognition.",
      "The room reflected that mood. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg was spotted chatting with Coogler, whose wife and \u201cSinners\" producer, Zinzi Coogler, stood beside him. Meanwhile, Michael B. Jordan worked the room, trading hugs and handshakes with fellow honorees and guests including \"Bugonia\" star Jesse Plemons and \u201cTask\u201d actor Mark Ruffalo. Filmmakers James Cameron and Guillermo del Toro greeted each other.",
      "Nearby, DiCaprio stood side by side with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and actors Benicio del Toro and Edward James Olmos. Chase Infiniti looked on from her table, gazing toward her \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d co-stars before the program kicked off.",
      "On the red carpet, with \u201cDeath by Lightning\u201d actor Nick Offerman beside him, George Clooney shared laughs with a photographer, adding to the easygoing tone that carried throughout the afternoon. After the event, Infiniti and Jordan reunited for a hug and a brief catch-up, a quiet moment that underscored the camaraderie in the room.",

      "The seven grants terminated in December supported numerous public health programs, including efforts to prevent sudden unexpected infant death, strengthen pediatric care in rural communities and support teens facing substance use and mental health challenges.",
      "AAP alleged the cuts were made in retaliation for the group speaking out against the Trump administration's positions and actions. HHS said in letters to AAP that the grants were cut because they no longer aligned with the department\u2019s priorities. The department has denied AAP's allegations of retaliation.",
      "AAP has been vocal about its support for pediatric vaccines and has publicly opposed HHS positions. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 has made sweeping changes to childhood vaccine recommendations.

      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",

      "\u201cWe were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.\u201d",

      "The group founded in the 1920s in Egypt inspired Islamist political movements around the region.",
      "Its ideology has been both popular and divisive in the Arab and Muslim world. The Brotherhood\u2019s leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means, but some of the group's offshoots have armed wings. Critics, including a number of autocratic governments across the region, view it as a threat.",
      "Here's how the group started and where it stands now.",
      "The Muslim Brotherhood rose as a pan-Arab Islamist political movement, founded in Egypt in 1928 by a school teacher-turned-ideologue Hassan al-Banna. He believed that Islamic teachings should be the basis for governance.",
      "In its early days, the group largely focused on providing social services, but it later turned to militancy, with an armed wing that fought against British colonialists and Israel. It was implicated in the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmoud Fahmi al-Nokrashi in 1948 after he outlawed the group. Two months later, al-Banna was assassinated in Cairo.",
      "After Egypt\u2019s 1952 military coup, the Brotherhood was accused of an assassination attempt against President Gamal Abdel-Nasser, who retaliated by executing prominent Brotherhood ideologue Sayyed Qutb and imprisoning thousands of other members.",
      "The group witnessed a revival in the 1970s under then-President Anwar Sadat, who tolerated the Brotherhood and used it as a counterweight to leftist opponents. The group formally foreswore violence.",
      "During the 30-year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood was technically banned but also tolerated. By 2005 it had become Egypt\u2019s strongest political opposition group, winning a fifth of the seats in parliament.",
      "The Brotherhood rose to power following elections in Egypt a year after the 2011 popular uprising that toppled Mubarak. But the group fueled opponents\u2019 fears that it aimed to monopolize power.",
      "After giant protests over Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi's divisive rule, the Egyptian army ousted the group in 2013, crushing it in a bloody crackdown.",
      "The authorities later outlawed the group and labeled it a terrorist organization. Authorities under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi have cracked down heavily on Brotherhood members and those suspected of links to the group, jailing thousands.",
      "The Brotherhood\u2019s leader, or supreme guide, Mohammed Badie, remains behind bars in Egypt under several life sentences, the last of which was upheld in July 2021. Nearly all of the group\u2019s senior leaders have been imprisoned or live in exile.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary's parliamentary election will take place on April 12, with the country\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n expected to face his toughest challenge in 16 years.",
      "President Tam\u00e1s Sulyok announced the election date on Tuesday, urging people to vote. \u201cOne of the cornerstones of democracy is the right to vote freely,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "The announcement comes as Orb\u00e1n and his nationalist-populist Fidesz party have been lagging behind the opposition Tisza party in most independent polls, the biggest disadvantage the prime minister has faced since taking office in 2010.",
      "Tisza's leader, center-right lawyer P\u00e9ter Magyar, 44, erupted onto Hungary's political stage less than two years ago and quickly built a political movement by embarking on nearly non-stop tours of the rural countryside and leveraging dissatisfaction with the country's chronically stagnant economy, high costs of living and fraying social services. Magyar has also promised to dismantle Orb\u00e1n\u2019s system and put Hungary on a more prosperous, democratic track.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, the European Union's longest-serving leader, reentered office in 2010 after serving one term as prime minister between 1998 and 2002. He boasts of transforming the European country into an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d and has centralized the country's institutions and taken control of much of the media. His critics accuse him of overseeing what they say is a widespread network of official corruption.",
      "The nationalist premier and his party have framed the April election as a choice between war and peace, claiming that Tisza is nothing more than an EU project contrived in Brussels to topple his government and install a puppet regime that will drain Hungary\u2019s finances into the war in neighboring Ukraine and even involve it directly in the conflict.",

      "Fewer Americans are signing up for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans this year",
      "NEW YORK -- Fewer Americans are signing up for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans this year, new federal data shows, as expiring subsidies and other factors push health expenses too high for many to manage.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "The new data released Monday evening by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is only a snapshot of a continuously changing pool of enrollees. It includes sign-ups through Jan. 3 in states that use Healthcare.gov for ACA plans and through Dec. 27 for states that have their own ACA marketplaces. In most states, the period for shopping for plans continues through Jan. 15 for plans that start in February.",
      "But even though it\u2019s early, the data builds on fears that expiring enhanced tax credits could cause a dip in enrollment and force many Americans to make tough decisions to delay buying health insurance, look for alternatives or forgo it entirely.",
      "Experts warn that the number of people who have signed up for plans may still drop even further, as enrollees get their first bill in January and some choose to cancel.",
      "The declining enrollment comes as Congress has been locked in a partisan battle over what to do about the subsidies that expired at the start of the new year. For months, Democrats have fought for a straight extension of the tax credits, while Republicans have insisted larger reforms are a better way to root out fraud and abuse and keep costs down overall. Last week, in a remarkable rebuke of Republican leadership, the House passed legislation to extend the subsidies for three years. The bill now sits in the Senate, where pressure is building for a bipartisan compromise.",
      "Up until this year, President Barack Obama's landmark health insurance program had been an increasingly popular option for Americans who don't get health coverage through their jobs, including small business owners, gig workers, farmers, ranchers and others.",
      "For the 2021 plan year, about 12 million people selected an Affordable Care Act plan. Enhanced tax credits were introduced the following year and four years later enrollment had doubled to over 24 million.",

      "The loss of enhanced subsidies means annual premium costs will more than double for the average ACA enrollee who had them, according to the health care research nonprofit KFF. But extending the subsidies would also be expensive for the country. Ahead of last week's House vote, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending the subsidies for three years would increase the nation's deficit by about $80.6 billion over the decade.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some of those who abandon ACA plans may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others will go without insurance at least temporarily while they look for alternatives.",
      "\u201cMy prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner said. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\u201d",
      "Several Americans interviewed by The Associated Press have said they're dropping coverage altogether for 2026 and will pay out of pocket for needed appointments. Many said they are crossing their fingers that they aren't affected by a costly injury or diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI'm pretty much going to be going without health insurance unless they do something,\u201d said 52-year-old Felicia Persaud, a Florida entrepreneur who dropped coverage when she saw her monthly ACA costs were set to increase by about $200 per month. \u201cIt's sort of like playing poker and hoping the chips fall and try the best that you can.\"",

      "The agency said in a statement late Monday that it \u201cabsolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment\" but \u201cwill not be monetizing the impacts at this time.\u201d The EPA will continue to estimate costs to businesses to comply with the rules and will continue \u201congoing work to refine its economic methodologies\u201d of pollution rules, spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.",
      "Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.",
      "\u201cThe EPA\u2019s mandate is to protect public health, not to ignore the science in order to eliminate clean air safeguards that save lives,'' said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "He called the change in how public health benefits are calculated \u201creckless, dangerous, and illegal,'' adding: \u201cBy pretending real health benefits do not count, EPA wants to open the door for industry to foul the air, while communities and families pay the price in asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.\u201d",
      "The change in how the EPA calculates health benefits was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The move comes as the Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.",

      "Since the EPA\u2019s creation more than 50 years ago, Republican and Democratic administrations have used different estimates to assign monetary value to a human life in cost-benefit analyses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated that its proposed rule on PM2.5 would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays by 2032. For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.",
      "But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading. By failing to include ranges or other qualifying statements, EPA\u2019s use of specific estimate \u201cleads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality,\u201d the agency said in an economic impact analysis for the new NOx rule.",
      "\u201cTherefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.\u201d",
      "The United States has made substantial progress in reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations since 2000, the agency said.",
      "But critics said a new EPA rule that revises emission limits for dangerous nitrogen oxide pollution from new gas-burning turbines used in power plants demonstrates the risks of the new approach.",
      "Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases. EPA\u2019s final NOx rule, issued Monday, is substantially less restrictive than a proposal under the Biden administration. For some gas plants, the rule weakens protections in place for two decades.",

      "Microsoft is trying to win over communities concerned about AI data centers",
      "It won\u2019t be easy for Big Tech companies to win the hearts and minds of Americans who are angered about massive artificial intelligence data centers sprouting up in their neighborhoods, straining electricity grids and drawing on local reservoirs.",
      "Microsoft is trying anyway.",
      "The software giant's president, Brad Smith, is meeting with federal lawmakers Tuesday to push forward an approach that calls for the industry, not taxpayers, to pay the full costs of the vast network of computing warehouses needed to power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's own Copilot. President Donald Trump gave Microsoft's effort a nod in a Truth Social post Monday evening, where he stated that he does not want Americans to \u201cpick up the tab\u201d for these data centers and pay higher utility costs.",
      "\u201cLocal communities naturally want to see new jobs but not at the expense of higher electricity prices or the diversion of their water,\u201d Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Smith's campaign comes as data center developers are increasingly running into hostility in towns where they want to build and meeting defeat at municipal boards that must approve zoning applications or construction permits.",
      "Rising electric prices are one problem. Heavy water usage by data centers to cool electronic equipment has also elicited concerns from local residents that they\u2019ll see their wells run dry or their water utility bills spike.",
      "The defeats have spread alarm among data center allies and spurred efforts to ramp up the amount of money that operators are willing to offer communities in exchange for approval.",
      "\u201cPeople are asking not just pointed questions but completely reasonable questions and it\u2019s our job, I think, to acknowledge them and address them head on and show that we can do this and pursue this expansion in a way that fully meets their needs,\u201d said Smith, who is also Microsoft's vice chair and has spent decades leading its legal and political work.",
      "In the mid-Atlantic region grid that encompasses all or parts of 13 states, ratepayers have been paying higher prices on their bills since at least June because of data centers, according to utilities and analysts.",
      "Electricity bills are expected to keep rising as payments to power plant owners grow to entice the construction of new power sources to meet demand from new and yet-to-be-built data centers in hotspots like Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "Another source of friction is that big data center developers can strike bulk power deals with local electric utilities that are profitable for utilities, but also kept confidential. That means it may never be clear whether data center operators really are paying for their electricity \u2014 or foisting the cost onto the rest of the utility\u2019s ratepayers, consumer advocates say.",
      "Data center projects have also met objections in communities where people are worried about losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character, or are concerned about the damage to quality of life, property values, environment or their health.",
      "In Hobart, Indiana, last week, the City Council approved a tax-abatement package for a multibillion-dollar Amazon data center planned there. In turn, the deal promises Amazon will make two payments of $5 million each for issuing a pair of building permits, plus another series of payments totaling $175 million over three years at various project milestones.",

The company has promised the centers will employ hundreds of people when they\u2019re finished. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has touted the projects he says will put Wisconsin \u201con the very cutting edge of AI power.\u201d",
      "But environmentalists and consumer groups have warned that the centers will consume unprecedented amounts of electricity, driving up rates across the Midwestern power grid, and could use hundreds of thousands of gallons of Lake Michigan water daily. Company officials have pledged that the centers\u2019 impact will be minimal and will contribute carbon-free energy to the power grid.",
      "Environmental group Clean Wisconsin has called for government officials to pause data center approvals until the state develops a comprehensive plan to regulate them. Francesca Hong, one of several Democratic candidates for governor \u2014 Evers is not seeking re-election in November \u2014 has developed a proposal she calls CONTROL ALT DELETE that calls for a moratorium on data center construction until \u201cwe know how to protect ourselves from their environmental and energy costs.\u201d",
      "In the interview with AP, Smith talked about data center projects in Wisconsin and elsewhere. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "Smith: We don\u2019t use nearly as much water as we do electricity. Electricity is a heavier lift. It\u2019s a larger investment. And it comes after several decades where electricity production in the United States was basically flat. If you look at the approach that we\u2019re taking in terms of partnering with utilities, paying our own way, I think we can address this problem to the satisfaction of local communities. At the end of the day, it requires the approval of the utilities commissions.",
      "Smith: I shouldn\u2019t name names. First of all, we wholeheartedly agree with the positive impact that AI is going to create for the future. But we don\u2019t think that the public should be devoting tax dollars to pay for the improvements in the electricity grid that are needed to serve data centers. Private companies can incorporate that into their financial planning, especially when you look at things like improvements on the transmission side or improvements in substations.",
      "Smith: We set a goal for ourselves in 2020 of being what we call carbon-negative by 2030. That requires that we reduce the amount of carbon emissions that we create, and that we then remove from the environment each year, beginning in 2030, more carbon than we emit. We have not changed course on that. There are times when the power that is coming to our data centers is generated by something like natural gas. We can work with a utility to ensure that it\u2019s cleaner natural gas, but beyond that, we also invest in bringing to the regional grid new sources of carbon-free energy as well, whether it\u2019s nuclear, solar, hydro or others.",
      "Smith: On the carbon commitment, we have a clear path to reach our goal in 2030. As we often say, progress is lumpy, not linear. A lot of what we\u2019re doing in the middle of the decade is making the investments that will benefit us at the end of the decade. It\u2019s not like walking upstairs, where every step is the same length. But overall, I continue to be confident in our ability to meet our goals at the end of the decade.",
      "Smith: We are supportive of Wisconsin developing a comprehensive electricity plan. I don\u2019t think our project should be paused to wait for that. We\u2019re partnering to build out and improve the electricity grid in southeastern Wisconsin. A rate tariff that we have proposed to the public utility commission would impose on Microsoft additional costs that we would help pay for in the state. And because of other investments we\u2019re making, including a 150-megawatt solar farm.",

      "The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said in a statement that it has identified the misuse of Grok to generate and distribute harmful content including sexually explicit, indecent, extremely offensive as well as non-consensual manipulated images.",
      "It said it served notices to X and xAI this month to remove the harmful content but no action has been taken.",
      "\u201cContent allegedly involving women and children is a matter of great concern. Such conduct is against Malaysian law and undermines the security commitments\u201d stated by the companies, it said. The commission has appointed a lawyer and said legal proceedings would begin soon.",
      "There is growing scrutiny of generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, and concern that existing safeguards are failing to prevent their abuse.",

      "Four days earlier, Russia also sent hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in a large-scale overnight attack and, for only the second time in the war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in what appeared to be a clear warning to Kyiv\u2019s NATO allies that it won\u2019t back down.",

      "Russia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat and running water in the freezing winter months over the course of the war, hoping to wear down public resistance to Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.

      "A Hong Kong court moved closer to sentencing prominent democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, who was convicted under a national security law and could face up to life imprisonment",
      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court heard sentencing arguments Tuesday for former publisher Jimmy Lai's co-defendants as it moved closer to sentencing the prominent democracy advocate whose conviction under a national security law could land him in prison for life. The jail term's potential length remained unclear.",
      "Former executives of the now-defunct, pro-democracy newspaper founded by Lai finished pleading for lighter sentences Tuesday afternoon in the landmark case widely seen as a barometer of media freedom in a city once hailed as a bastion of free press in Asia.",
      "The former journalists pleaded guilty in 2022 to conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security. They admitted to the prosecution's charge that said they conspired with their ex-boss and onetime media mogul Lai to request foreign sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty in the case, was convicted in December. The verdict raised concerns about the city's declining press freedom and drew criticism from foreign governments.",
      "But the government insists the case has nothing to do with media freedom, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.",
      "Following the conclusion of arguments, Esther Toh, one of the three government-vetted judges, said they would need to analyze the lawyers' arguments, saying they will inform them \u201cas soon as we can\" on the sentencing date. They did not give a date.",
      "After the judges left, some people in the public gallery waved goodbye to the defendants. Lai pressed his palms together in an apparent expression of gratitude before leaving the courtroom.",
      "Six Apple Daily executives were convicted in Lai's case: publisher Cheung Kim-hung; associate publisher Chan Pui-man; editor-in-chief Ryan Law; executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung; executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong; and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. Some of them served as prosecution witnesses during the 156-day trial.",
      "A conviction on the collusion charge carries a sentence ranging from three years to life in prison. But a guilty plea can result in a sentence reduction. Under the security law, a reduced penalty may be granted to those who report on offenses committed by others.",
      "Chan's lawyer, Marco Li, said if the judges decided to place his client in the upper sentencing band, he suggested the starting point should be 10 years, given her limited role. Citing factors including her timely plea and assistance to the prosecution, he asked for her sentence to be halved.",
      "Li said Chan, who started working at Apple Daily in 1996 and has an emotional attachment to journalism, regretted not resisting even more firmly when matters arose that made her uncomfortable. But according to her mitigation letter, Chan couldn't leave her beloved job casually at that time because she was suffering serious health issues and was under financial burden, he said.",

      "Chung Pui-kuen, Chan's husband and a former top editor of the now-shuttered Stand News, was among those in the public gallery. He was sentenced to 21 months in jail in a separate sedition case.",
      "Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule. It attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and eventual short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "During Hong Kong's massive anti-government protests in 2019, Apple Daily ran articles sympathetic to protesters and supportive of the pro-democracy movement that saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets.",
      "After Beijing imposed the security law to quell the protests, Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested. Within a year, Apple Daily's former executives also were arrested. The prosecutions, asset freeze and police raids forced the newspaper's closure in June 2021. Its final edition sold a million copies.",
      "In their December verdict, the judges said Lai had used Apple Daily as a platform for spreading his political ideas and implementing his political agenda before and after the introduction of the security law.",
      "The judges on Monday heard arguments about the sentencing of Lai, Cheung and two other non-Apple Daily activists involved in the former publisher\u2019s case.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom Tuesday, he smiled at people sitting in the public gallery as a supporter formed a heart shape with her hands.",

      "The president has suggested that jitters about affordability are a \u201choax\u201d unnecessarily stirred by Democrats. Still, though he's imposed steep tariffs on U.S. trading partners around the world, Trump has reduced some of them when it comes to making cars \u2014 including extending import levies on foreign-made auto parts until 2030.",
      "Ford announced last month that it was scrapping plans to make an electric F-150, despite pouring billions of dollars into broader electrification, after the Trump administration slashed targets to have half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030, eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening the emissions and gas mileage rules.",
      "Trump's Michigan swing follows economy-focused speeches he gave last month in Pennsylvania \u2014 where his gripes about immigrants arriving to the U.S. from \u201cfilthy\u201d countries got more attention than his pledges to fight inflation \u2014 and North Carolina, where he insisted his tariffs have spurred the economy, despite residents noting the squeeze of higher prices.",
      "Trump carried Michigan in 2016 and 2024, after it swung Democratic and backed Joe Biden in 2020. He marked his first 100 days in office with a rally-style April speech outside Detroit, where he focused more on past campaign grudges than his administration's economic or policy plans.",
      "During that visit nearly nine months ago, Trump also spoke at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and announced a new fighter jet mission, allaying fears that the base could close. It represented a win for Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 and the two even shared a hug.",

The yearly rate would be down from 2.7% in November. Monthly prices, however, are expected to rise 0.3% in December, faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal.",
      "The figures are harder to predict this month, however, because the six-week government shutdown last fall suspended the collection of price data used to compile the inflation rate. Some economists expect the December figures will show a bigger jump in inflation as the data collection process gets back to normal.",
      "Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, are also expected to rise 0.3% in December from the previous month, and 2.7% from a year earlier. The yearly core figure would be an increase from 2.6% in November.",
      "In November, annual inflation fell from 3% in September to 2.7%, in part because of quirks in November's data. (The government never calculated a yearly figure for October). Most prices were collected in the second half of November, after the government reopened, when holiday discounts kicked in, which may have biased November inflation lower.",

      "Inflation has come down significantly from the four-decade peak of 9.1% that it reached in June 2022, but it has been stubbornly close to 3% since late 2023. The cost of necessities such as groceries is about 25% higher than it was before the pandemic, and other necessities such as rent and clothing have also gotten more expensive, fueling dissatisfaction with the economy that both President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden have sought to address, though with limited success.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
      "The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation\u2019s energy needs or were not economically viable.

The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 \"rationally advances their stated government interest,\u201d the judge added.",
      "The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration\u2019s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.",

Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020.",
      "In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said.",

Figueroa, who has asthma and recently learned her lung cancer is back, worries about health risks.",
      "\u201cI don't want to be anyone's experiment,\" said Figueroa, 60, a resident of Orange Cove in California's Central Valley.",
      "The Southern California Gas Co. wants to blend and inject hydrogen into the town\u2019s gas infrastructure, after the state agency that regulates utilities directed them and other companies to launch pilot projects. Proponents see it as key to helping California reduce planet-warming pollution by curbing reliance on gas while integrating cleaner energy into existing infrastructure. It's part of a statewide effort to create safety rules for hydrogen blending. But opponents say it poses unnecessary risks, and Orange Cove's mostly Latino and low-income residents say processes are happening without transparency or their input. Projects in states such as Colorado and Oregon have also raised concerns.",
      "Interest in deploying hydrogen boomed during the Biden administration but has been hard hit with the Trump administration's cancellation of billions of dollars for hydrogen technology and other clean energy projects, including $1.2 billion for a hydrogen hub in California.",
      "The Orange Cove project is one of five proposed in California to test how gas pipelines and the appliances they fuel hold up with different amounts of hydrogen. Hawaii has been blending for decades.",

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has touted it \u201can essential aspect of how we\u2019ll power our future and cut pollution.\"",
      "Some see the 18-month proposed project in Orange Cove as one step in that direction. A solar farm would power the technology and direct the mixture, up to 5% hydrogen, to businesses and the town's roughly 10,000 residents. The estimated $64.3 million project would be paid for with ratepayer money.",
      "A Minneapolis utility company estimated a blend of up to 5% green hydrogen would reduce carbon pollution by about 1,200 tons annually, the equivalent of removing 254 gas-powered cars.",
      "Janice Lin of the Green Hydrogen Coalition said it's important to test blending. The U.S. has a vast network of gas pipelines \u2014 about 3 million miles, according to the Department of Energy \u2014 which can be used to move clean hydrogen while reducing reliance on gas, she said. If scaled, it could be cost-competitive and help industries that can't fully electrify pollute less.",

The consensus is that up to 20% hydrogen by volume is safe, she said, but \u201cwe need more experimental work that uses real natural gas infrastructure to fully understand the impacts of hydrogen.\"",

      "SoCalGas first proposed testing hydrogen blending in facilities at the University of California, Irvine, in an affluent community. But it scaled back and revised its proposal following protests. When Orange Cove leaders expressed interest, the gas company identified the city an ideal candidate \u2014 it has various pipeline materials, including steel and polyethylene, a type of plastic, and only one gas feed coming in, allowing them ample control of the blend.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting China this week to mend relations with the world's second-largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- A leader of Canada is visiting China this week for the first time in nearly a decade, a bid to rebuild the country's fractured relations with the world's second-largest economy \u2014 and reduce Canada's dependence on the United States.",
      "The push by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who arrives Wednesday, is part of a major rethink as ties sour with the U.S. \u2014 the world's No. 1 economy and long the largest trading partner for Canada by far.",
      "Carney aims to double Canada\u2019s non-American exports in the next decade in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and the American leader's musing that Canada could become \u201cthe 51st state.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt a time of global trade disruption, Canada is focused on building a more competitive, sustainable and independent economy,\u201d Carney said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner.\u201d",
      "Carney will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday and other officials.",
      "Canadian officials, in a briefing with reporters, said that it's an attempt re-energize a dormant strategic partnership and also noted that Washington's intervention in Venezuela is far reaching.",
      "Canadian officials said that there will be progress on trade irritants with Beijing, but not a definitive elimination of some tariffs.",
      "Two of Carney's lawmakers, meanwhile, said they are quitting a sponsored trip to Taiwan early to \u201cavoid confusion\u201d about Canada\u2019s China policy as Carney prepares to visit Beijing.",
      "In a joint statement, Liberal lawmakers Helena Jaczek and Marie-France Lalonde said while they are returning to Canada based on \u201cadvice from the government,\u201d it does not change Canada\u2019s stance on Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed.",
      "Michael Chong, the opposition Conservative foreign affairs critic, said the Liberal decision to quit the trip early is \u201cnothing short of kowtowing to Beijing\u2019s authoritarianism.\"",
      "Carney will be in China until Saturday, and then visit Qatar before attending the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs have pushed both Canada and China to look for opportunities to strengthen international cooperation, said Zhu Feng, the dean of the School of International Studies at China\u2019s Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cCarney\u2019s visit does reflect the new space for further development in China-Canadian relations under the current U.S. trade protectionism,\u201d he said. But he cautioned against overestimating the importance of the visit, noting that Canada remains a U.S. ally. The two North American nations also share a deep cultural heritage and a common geography.",
      "Carney has been in office less than a year, succeeding Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister for nearly a decade. He's not the first new leader of a country to try to repair relations with China.",
      "Australian Premier Anthony Albanese has reset ties since his Labor Party came to power in 2022. Relations had deteriorated under the previous conservative government, leading to Chinese trade restrictions on wine, beef, coal and other Australian exports.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to repair ties with China since his Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024. He is reportedly planning a visit to China, though the government has not confirmed that.",

      "Trump, who has said he will come to China in April, has indicated that he wants a smooth relationship with Beijing, though he also launched a tit-for-tat trade war, with tariffs rising to more than 100% before he backed down.",
      "In Canada, Trump's threats have raised questions about the country's longstanding relationship with its much more powerful neighbor. Those close ties have also been the source of much of Canada's friction with China in recent years.",
      "It was Canada's detention of a Chinese telecommunications executive at the request of the U.S. that started the deterioration of relations in late 2018. The U.S. wanted the Huawei Technologies Co. executive, Meng Wanzhou, to be extradited to face American charges.",
      "China retaliated by arresting two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on spying charges. While they were imprisoned, Meng was under house arrest in Vancouver, a Canadian city home to a sizable Chinese population. All three were released under a deal reached in 2021.",
      "More recently, Canada followed the U.S. in imposing a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum from China.",
      "China, which is Canada's No. 2 trading partner after the U.S., has hit back with tariffs on Canadian exports including canola, seafood and pork. It has indicated it would remove some of the tariffs if Canada were to drop the 100% charge on EVs.",
      "An editorial in China's state-run Global Times newspaper welcomed Carney's visit as a new starting point and called on Canada to lift \u201cunreasonable tariff restrictions\u201d and advance more pragmatic cooperation.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that China looks forward to Carney\u2019s visit as an opportunity to \u201cconsolidate the momentum of improvement in China-Canada relations.\u201d",

      "He has also tried to mend ties with India, where relations deteriorated in 2024 after the Trudeau government accused India of being involved in the 2023 killing of a Sikh activist in Canada. The fallout led to tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats, disruption of visa services, reduced consular staffing and a freeze on trade talks.",
      "A cautious thaw began last June. Since then, both sides have restored some consular services and resumed diplomatic contacts. In November, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said that the two countries would move quickly to advance a trade deal, noting the government's new foreign policy in response to Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "Carney is also expected to visit India later this year.",

      "Sand dredging is reshaping the coastline of Africa\u2019s largest city, Lagos, and driving away fish and livelihoods for some of Nigeria's poorest people",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- Beneath an eight-lane expressway, Nigerian men stand waist-deep in the Lagos Lagoon, lowering buckets into murky water. Each load brings up sand, reshaping the coastline of Africa\u2019s largest city and driving away fish and livelihoods for some of its poorest people.",
      "Not far from the bridge, wooden boats are loaded with sand. One of thousands of local dredgers, Akeem Sossu, 34, has been diving for sand for at least three years. He slips beneath the surface for about 15 seconds at a time, hauling up bucketloads bound for construction sites.",
      "Akeem said he and his partner earn about 12,000 naira ($8) each per boatload, selling to a middleman who supplies larger buyers. Filling a boat takes about three hours. Formerly a tailor, he said dredging now supports his household.",
      "\u201cI come out early, sometimes 5 a.m. or 6 a.m., depending on the tide,\u201d he said.",
      "Dredgers and local traders say the price of sand, crucial for making concrete, has risen steadily as development in Lagos has accelerated. A standard 30-ton truckload of what\u2019s known as sharp sand \u2014 coarse and gritty \u2014 now sells for about 290,000 naira, or roughly $202, reflecting strong demand.",
      "The changes to the lagoon that buffers the megacity of about 17 million people are unmistakable. What was once an open stretch of water is increasingly broken up by sandy patches, narrowing channels and reshaping currents that support thousands of fishermen.",
      "The transformation is most visible near Makoko, one of Lagos\u2019 oldest fishing communities. Dredging barges operate close to homes built on stilts, while reclaimed land and construction of upscale beachfront properties press in from the edges. Residents say the encroachment has destroyed fishing grounds and put many out of work.",
      "Nearby, fishermen wait for the day\u2019s dredging to pause. They say that when it does, even briefly, some fish return.",
      "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic engine, is in constant construction. Roads, bridges and housing estates are rising daily on reclaimed waterfronts as the city's rich displace many of its poor.",
      "Over the past five years, dozens of registered dredging firms and numerous informal operators have sprung up or increased their operations, extracting sand from rivers and coastal waters across Lagos State.",
      "Industry analysts estimate the city consumes tens of millions of cubic meters of sand each year, an amount roughly equivalent to 16,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.",
      "Lagoon sand is particularly prized by builders, who say it produces stronger concrete than sand that is dredged inland.",
      "Fishermen and environmental researchers say the cost of that demand is increasingly visible in the water.",
      "\u201cWe are not powerful,\u201d said a community leader of Makoko, Baale Semede Emmanuel. \u201cDredgers have spoiled the entire waters.\u201d",
      "Fishermen there say dredging has wiped out shallow areas where fish once spawned before moving into deeper waters. At times, fish are sucked through dredging pipes.",
      "\u201cAnywhere dredging is happening, there\u2019s no fish,\u201d Emmanuel said. \u201cThe noise drives them away. The places where they used to reproduce are gone.\u201d",
      "With catches shrinking, fishermen say they must travel farther offshore, increasing fuel costs and exposure to rougher seas. Some have stopped fishing altogether.",
      "\u201cWe have no other work apart from fishing,\u201d Emmanuel said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find fish, we will starve.\u201d",
      "For some fishermen, dredging has forced an uneasy shift away from the sea. Joshua Monday said he has largely parked his two fishing boats and now works as a mechanic.",
      "He learned how to fix boat engines years ago as a backup.",
      "\u201cIf not for this mechanic work, I don\u2019t know how I would survive,\u201d he said.",

      "Scientists have warned that dredging reduces the lagoon\u2019s ability to absorb floodwaters, increasing long-term risks for Lagos and its population. Wetlands and shallow lagoon areas act as natural buffers. When they are removed or destabilized, communities become more vulnerable.",

      "An autistic Barbie is joining Mattel's line of fashion dolls that's intended to celebrate diversity",
      "NEW YORK -- Mattel Inc. is introducing an autistic Barbie on Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the autistic doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways autistic people may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \u201cautism doesn\u2019t look any one way,\u201d Pervez said. \u201cBut we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\u201d",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some autistic people use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some autistic people wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely a little bit of a fragile group right now,\u201d defenseman Braden Schneider said. \u201cThe guys know we\u2019re a good team. We believe that we have the ability to win games, and guys still believe in here that we\u2019re good. We\u2019ve just got to make sure that we\u2019re not letting the small things that happen in a game get to us.\u201d",
      "Small things are digging a big hole for the Rangers as they look to make up ground in a competitive Eastern Conference with all 16 teams separated by just 15 points in the standings going into play Tuesday night. They're last in points percentage with a record of 20-21-6 and are running out of time to become legitimate playoff contenders before it's too late.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fun to lose,\u201d said center Mika Zibanejad, who has scored six goals in five games and leads the team with 18. \"We\u2019re trying to look for answers, trying to find answers. Maybe it doesn\u2019t look it at times, I understand that, but we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to try to get a win.\u201d",
      "Coach Mike Sullivan after his team's most recent loss Monday night at home to Seattle said, \u201cThe answers are inside our locker room\u201d and tried to push that message before practice Tuesday. A two-time Stanley Cup champion from his time with Pittsburgh, Sullivan is preaching positivity at arguably the toughest point of his first season on the job.",

We\u2019re not going to get overwhelmed by circumstance or the noise.\u201d",
      "The noise is that the March 6 trade deadline is less than two months away, with a lengthy pause in February for the Olympics in between. Winger Artemi Panarin, New York's leading scorer every season since signing as a free agent in 2019, does not have a contract beyond June 30, turns 35 on Oct. 31 and could be the first big-money player out the door.",
      "With 14 games remaining before the deadline, it's an uphill climb to push general manager Chris Drury into buying or standing pat rather than selling and beginning the process of retooling an aging roster.",
      "\u201cWe still have a chance to compete and just climb in the standings,\u201d defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov said. \"We\u2019ve got to do it now because after the Olympic break, that would be maybe a little late, so we need it now, (and) we\u2019ve got to be desperate every single night.\u201d",
      "A 10-2 loss at Boston on national television Saturday was a humbling experience, but most of the defeats have not been so lopsided. Rather, they have come from mistakes \u2014 an ill-timed line change or a missed assignment \u2014 compounding on each other and leading to goals against.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s for a lack of effort,\u201d captain J.T. Miller said. \u201cJust mistakes, and we talked about playing smart, as well as hard. Just some things we need to clean up.\u201d",

It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciation I have for Coach Tomlin,\u201d Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. \u201cHe guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Brooks Koepka is back on the PGA Tour, a decision that should have surprised no one.",
      "Brian Rolapp, only five months into his role as CEO of PGA Tour Enterprises, faced what he called a \u201cunique situation.\" Koepka wanted to return after four years on LIV Golf, where he pulled in more than $41.6 million in earnings \u2014 more than he made in nine seasons on the PGA Tour \u2014 to go along with a signing bonus Koepka had said was nine figures. Count the commas.",
      "That led to emergency meetings, phone calls with key voices on tour, board approval of a path that let Koepka back in and finally a face-to-face meeting with the former captain of Smash GC.",
      "All of that was necessary. But the answer could be found last August when Rolapp was 18 days into his new job and introduced buzzwords like \u201cscarcity\u201d and \u201csimplicity\u201d while discussing his plans for significant \u2014 not incremental \u2014 change on the PGA Tour.",
      "He was asked about the priority of getting the best players together, even as the tour's negotiations with Saudi Arabia as an investor had become too broken for even President Donald Trump to fix.",

      "Whether the return of Koepka achieves that depends on how he plays.",
      "His performance also will determine whether the punishment fits the crime of his defection to Saudi-funded LIV Golf in 2022. By the tour's math \u2014 based largely on Koepka not getting equity in the tour for five years \u2014 it could be as much as $85 million.",
      "But it beats the alternative: leaving Koepka off the roster.",
      "\u201cI keep going back to this,\u201d said former British Open champion Brian Harman, an avid hunter whose intellect goes beyond how to harvest elk or trap beavers. \"In everything that happens, there isn't all winners and all losers. There's some good and some bad. Whenever something like this happens, I try to figure out the positive. The positive is the tour with Brooks Koepka is a stronger tour.",
      "\u201cRegardless of how you feel about him leaving the PGA Tour, regardless of how you feel about LIV Golf, the PGA Tour is stronger today.\u201d",
      "That's the North Star guiding Rolapp, the former NFL executive viewed as a potential successor to Commissioner Roger Goodell. He's the first PGA Tour chief without a deep golf heritage, and that works to his favor in this case.",
      "Rolapp wasn't around when Commissioner Jay Monahan rallied the troops against a rival league paying outrageous sums to lure away big names, only to strike a secret deal with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia that caused a player revolt.",
      "All that talk about players not being allowed back if they leave? That didn't happen on Rolapp's watch. He cares only about the road ahead, not the rearview mirror. Does it strengthen the tour? And if retribution is required, find the appropriate penalty.",
      "If Koepka being part of the PGA Tour makes it stronger, and its value increases, the loyalists have more to gain. Everyone makes more money except for Koepka. That's the idea, anyway, and Koepka was fine with it.",
      "\u201cThere was no negotiating,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to hurt, it does hurt, but I understand. It\u2019s not supposed to be an easy path. There\u2019s a lot of people that were hurt by it when I left, and I understand that\u2019s part of coming back.\u201d",

      "There is no indication any of the other three want to leave, though DeChambeau is the most curious case. He already is negotiating an extension with LIV and this would seem to give him leverage. Can LIV afford to lose DeChambeau now?",
      "Rolapp was practically daring the three players to take him up on the offer.",
      "\u201cThis is a one-time, defined window and is not a precedent for future situations,\" he wrote in his memo. \u201cOnce the door closes, there is no promise that this path will be available again.\u201d",
      "The timing of that window is curious. It could be linked to the year LIV launched in 2022. It's also one year after Phil Mickelson, the ringleader of the LIV movement, won the PGA Championship.",
      "Also ineligible for the offer are Dustin Johnson, Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton and seven-time LIV winner Joaquin Niemann. Is there a path back for them if they want?",
      "Only if they make the PGA Tour stronger. For Rolapp, it starts there.",

    "story": [
      "Belgian biathlete Maya Cloetens is concerned about the future of winter sports in a warming world",
      "Belgian biathlete Maya Cloetens can\u2019t help but think about the future of winter sports as she trains for next month's Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina, Italy.",
      "Evidence of climate change is all around her in the mountains above Grenoble, France, where the 24-year-old fell in love with the sport that combines cross-country skiing and shooting.",
      "Grenoble hosted the 1968 Winter Olympics, but its winters are shorter and milder nowadays, and with less consistent heavy snowfall. When the games return to the French Alps in 2030, Grenoble won't be the focal point.",
      "\u201cI grew up there, and I really see the difference of snow,\u201d Cloetens said. \u201cIn 15 years, it has completely changed.\u201d",
      "With the Earth warming at a record rate, the list of locales that could reliably host a Winter Games will shrink substantially in the coming years, according to researchers. The situation is serious enough that the International Olympic Committee is considering rotating the games among a permanent pool of suitable locations and holding them earlier in the season because March is getting too warm for the Paralympic Games, said Karl Stoss, who chairs the games' Future Host Commission.",
      "Out of 93 mountain locations that currently have the winter sports infrastructure to host elite competition, only 52 should have the snow depth and sufficiently cold temperatures to be able to host a Winter Olympics in the 2050s, according research conducted by University of Waterloo professor Daniel Scott and University of Innsbruck associate professor Robert Steiger that the IOC is using. The number could drop to as low as 30 by the 2080s, depending on how much the world curbs carbon dioxide pollution.",
      "And, the IOC prioritizes locations with at least 80% existing venues, making the pool of potential hosts significantly smaller.",
      "The situation is bleaker for the Paralympic Winter Games, which are typically held at the same venues two weeks after the Winter Olympics conclude. However, Scott said he and Steiger found that starting both sets of games about three weeks earlier would almost double the number of reliable locations for the Paralympic Games. Their modeling presumes advanced snowmaking, finding that there are almost no locations that could reliably host the snow sports without snowmaking by mid-century.",
      "Grenoble isn't the only past host that the researchers believe won't be \u201cclimate reliable\u201d enough to do it again by the 2050s. Chamonix, France, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, and Sochi, Russia, also didn't make the cut, while past venues in Vancouver, Canada; Palisades Tahoe, California; Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Oslo, Norway, would be \u201cclimatically risky.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is going to change the geography of where we can hold the Winter Olympics and the Paralympics. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe only question is, how much?\u201d",
      "Manufactured snow was first used for the Winter Games in 1980 in Lake Placid, New York. Beijing was the first to rely almost entirely on snowmaking in 2022.",
      "For these Olympics, the organizing committee plans to make nearly 2.4 million cubic meters (3.1 million cubic yards) of snow. In contrast, when Cortina hosted the 1956 Olympics, no manufactured snow was used, though the Italian army did transport truckloads of snow down from the Dolomites.",
      "The Italian company supplying nearly all of the new snowmaking systems, TechnoAlpin, developed technology to make snow in temperatures well above freezing. The company said it sent its \u201cSnowFactory\u201d to Antholz \u2014 the biathlon site \u2014 to guarantee sufficient snow cover.",
      "Davide Cerato oversees snowmaking operations at several Olympic venues. With the newest systems, he said, they can make a lot of snow, efficiently, even at marginal snowmaking temperatures\u2014 for the moment.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Northern Italy is known for its cold, snowy winters. But seasonal snowfall has reduced considerably throughout the Alpine region, with the sharpest declines mainly over the last 40 years due to the temperature increase.",

      "Traditional snowmaking equipment requires cold temperatures and low humidity. Europe is the fastest-warming continent.",
      "It takes an immense about of energy and water to make snow. That can make climate change worse if the electricity is supplied by burning fossil fuels, and can exacerbate water issues in regions where it's scarce. For Milan Cortina, electricity partner Enel is guaranteeing entirely renewable and certified electricity.",
      "The organizing committee estimates needing 250 million gallons (946 million liters) of water, the equivalent of nearly 380 Olympic swimming pools, for snowmaking. It carved out new high-elevation water reservoirs, or lakes, to store it.",
      "\u201cWithout water, there are no Games,\u201d said Carmen de Jong, a University of Strasbourg hydrology professor.",
      "She is critical of building reservoirs that alter the natural ecosystem, though sees no solution\u2014 the appetite for artificial snow will only increase due to climate change.",
      "Events like the Olympics draw participants and fans from around the world and have always contributed to climate change. Many people fly there, new venues are built and a lot of electricity is used to power them, emitting vast amounts of carbon pollution.",
      "Recognizing this, the IOC is requiring hosts to minimize their water and electricity use and avoid unnecessary construction. It may need to eventually reduce the number of sports, athletes and spectators who attend, said Stoss, the Future Host Commission chair.",
      "As the leading organization for sport, Stoss said, it\u2019s the IOC's responsibility to show how to protect winter sports for the long term.",
      "The IOC picked the French Alps for the 2030 Winter Olympics and Salt Lake City, Utah for 2034. It's talking exclusively with Switzerland about 2038. Stoss said he likes Switzerland because of its existing infrastructure and excellent public transportation.",
      "He said this is the future, choosing countries with good conditions and high standards for protecting the climate. He praised Milan-Cortina for using mostly existing venues and reducing the games' environmental impact.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why the American president would want teams from certain countries not to take part. If that\u2019s the case, they shouldn\u2019t agree to host the World Cup,\u201d Senegal supporter Djibril Gueye told The Associated Press in Tangier, Morocco.",

      "President Donald Trump cited \u201c screening and vetting deficiencies \u201d as the main reason for the suspensions. Fans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries who have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.",
      "The restrictions include an exception for players, team officials and immediate relatives traveling to the World Cup, but no allowance has been made for supporters.",
      "\u201cWe really want to participate but we don\u2019t know how,\u201d said Fatou Diedhiou, the president of a group of female Senegal fans. \u201cNow we just wait because the World Cup isn\u2019t here yet, maybe they\u2019ll change their minds. We don\u2019t know. We wait and see.\u201d",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians made phone calls abroad for the first time in days Tuesday after authorities severed communications during a crackdown on nationwide protests that activists say killed at least 646 people, giving a glimpse of life after being cut off from the outside world.",
      "Witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people remain concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of strikes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could possibly use the military to defend peaceful protesters. Trump also has said Iran wants to negotiate with Washington.",
      "\u201cMy customers talk about Trump\u2019s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concerns for his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.\u201d",
      "Reza, a taxi driver who also gave just his first name, said protests remain on many people's minds. \u201cPeople \u2014 particularly young ones \u2014 are hopeless but they talk about continuing the protests,\u201d he said.",
      "Several people in Tehran were able to call The Associated Press on Tuesday morning and speak to a journalist there. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was unable to call those numbers back. The witnesses said text messaging still was down and that internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.",
      "Anti-riot police officers, wearing helmets and body armor, carried batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, the witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who similarly carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces as well.",
      "Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, they said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, the witnesses added.",
      "However, shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began Dec. 28, was to open Tuesday. However, a witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said the security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media had not acknowledged that order.",
      "The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes. While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in their homes and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.",
      "On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.",
      "State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free \u2014 a signal some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.\u201d",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk\u2019s social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",

      "Google said the AI-assisted shopping features in Gemini only would be available to U.S. users initially but that it planned to expand internationally in the coming months.

      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",

      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",

      "Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a \u201cthreat\u201d and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that it knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers.",
      "The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",
      "In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. To try to overcome that skepticism, Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco\u2019s activities involving China took place in the United States.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "Gmail's new AI options will only be available in English within the United States for starters, but the company is promising to expand the technology to other countries and other languages as the year unfolds.",
      "The most broadly available tool will be a \u201cHelp Me Write\u201d option designed to learn a user's writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to burnish the message.",
      "Google is also offering subscribers who pay for its Pro and Ultra services access to technology that mirrors the AI Overviews that's been built into its search engine since 2023. The expansion will enable subscribers pose conversational questions in Gmail's search bar to get instant answers about information they are trying to retrieve from their inboxes.",
      "In what could turn into another revolutionary step, \u201cAI Inbox\u201d is also being rolled out to a subset of \u201ctrusted testers\u201d in the U.S. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",

      "Allowing Google's AI to dig deeper into inboxes to learn more about their habits and interest also could raise privacy issues \u2014 a challenge that Gmail confronted from the get-go.",
      "To help subsidize the free service, Google included targeted ads in Gmail that were based on information contained within the electronic conversations. That twist initially triggered a privacy backlash among lawmakers and consumer groups, but the uproar eventually died down and never deterred Gmail's rapid growth as an email provider. Rivals eventually adopted similar features.",

The Mountain View, California, company says it also has built an \u201cengineering privacy\u201d barrier to corral all the information within inboxes to protect it from prying eyes.",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Starting on March 3, the livestreamed tours will be held weekly, on Tuesdays, with one in Italian and one in English, though more are foreseen. Groups are limited to a dozen people and require reservations, as well as an additional ticket beyond the typical Colosseum-Palatine Hill entrance fee.",

      "The latest restrictions were adopted after Mount Etna started a round of eruptions on Christmas Eve.",

      "Wildlife crews have stopped actively searching for two juvenile gray wolves in Northern California's Sierra Valley",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Wildlife crews are no longer actively searching for two juvenile gray wolves who were part of a pack that killed dozens of cows and calves last summer in Northern California\u2019s Sierra Valley, an official said Tuesday.",
      "The two wolves were members of the Beyem Seyo pack that in 2025 killed or injured at least 92 calves and cows in a seven-month period, according to a report released last week by two researchers with the University of California, Davis.",
      "Wolves in the state are protected under California law and the federal Endangered Species Act. Under former President Joe Biden, officials said they planned a first-ever national recovery plan for wolves, but President Donald Trump\u2019s administration ended that initiative in November.",
      "In October, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced it had euthanized four gray wolves \u2014 three adults and a juvenile \u2014 from the Beyem Seyo pack after \u201can unprecedented level of livestock attacks across the Sierra Valley.\u201d It also said it planned to capture and relocate the remaining two wolves to wildlife facilities to prevent their behavior from spreading to other wolves in California.",
      "Gray wolves primarily prey on wild animals like deer and elk, not livestock, the department said, calling the attacks by the Beyem Seyo against farm animals \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese wolves had become habituated to preying on cattle, a feeding pattern that persisted and was being taught to their offspring which would leave to form their own packs and could teach them the same cattle-preying behavior,\u201d the department said at the time.",
      "But following weeks of searching for the remaining two wolves, officials have \u201creduced efforts to capture\u201d them, Katie Talbot, CDFW Deputy Director of Public Affairs, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cDespite best efforts from CDFW\u2019s expert wolf biologists and law enforcement officers, we have not been able to find or get close enough to these young wolves to safely capture them,\u201d Talbot said.",
      "\u201cWe remain hopeful our continued remote monitoring will allow for sightings that will lead to safe capture of these juveniles,\" she added.",
      "Wildlife officials tried for months to deter the pack from attacking farm animals by using drones, nonlethal bean bags, installing flags or rope to deter them and having officers in the field 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but their efforts failed.",
      "Gray wolves were eradicated in California early in the last century because of their perceived threat to livestock, with the last known native wolf killed in 1924 in Lassen County. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they\u2019ve proliferated, with a pack reappearing in Northern California in 2015.

      "\u201cIt was a horrible summer here for everybody and the emotional strain was probably worse than the financial strain for most people. They did the right thing. We couldn\u2019t go on living the way we were living,\u201d said Rick Roberti, a cattle rancher in Plumas County and president of the California Cattlemen\u2019s Association, who lost several animals.",
      "Economist Tina Saitone and researcher Tracy Schohr said in UC Davis\u2019 quarterly agricultural economics update released Friday that the Beyem Seyo\u2019s pack depredations were unprecedented not only in the state but also nationally. The pack killed more livestock than the entire wolf population of Montana killed in 2024 and the killings of farm animals by the wolves in Wyoming in 2023.",
      "In Montana, the state\u2019s 1,100 wolves killed 54 domestic animals in 2024, and Wyoming\u2019s 352 wolves killed 49 livestock in 2023, the scientists said.",
      "In California, about 70 gray wolves were responsible for 175 livestock kills between January and October of last year, with the Beyem Seyo pack responsible for half of the killings, according to CDFW data.",
      "Roberti said the attacks on livestock in Plumas and Sierra counties left many ranchers angry. He said he would like to see certain areas in the state declared \u201cspecial zones\u201d where people are allowed to hunt wolves that attack livestock.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much in unison about thinking that it would help if we started taking out the ones that are just killing cattle and are too habituated to man or they\u2019re not afraid of us,\u201d he said.",

      "This is the second time Louisiana has pursued an out-of-state doctor under its abortion restrictions, with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry saying on social media that he wants to bring the abortion provider \u201cto justice.\u201d The two criminal cases pit Louisiana, which has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, against jurisdictions that have enacted what are known as shield laws for providers who facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",

      "Remy Coeytaux, a physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, faces a criminal charge of abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday. If convicted, the doctor could face up to 50 years in jail and fines, Murrill said.",
      "An email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "According to court documents, he is accused of mailing mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 to a Louisiana woman who sought the medication through Aid Access, a European online telemedicine service. The woman took the pills in combination to end her pregnancy, investigators wrote in the indictment, which says authorities confirmed Coeytaux as the sender.",

Last year, state lawmakers passed additional restrictions targeting out-of-state prescribers and reclassified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances.",

In that case, officials said the minor\u2019s mother ordered the medication online and directed her daughter to take it. The mother was later arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",

      "When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law in July, it pushed another significant round of tax cuts and also cut the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, at times the banking industry's nemesis, by nearly half. Trump\u2019s bank regulators have also been pushing a deregulatory agenda that both banks and large corporations have embraced.",

      "State Sen. Dan McKeon has resigned from the Nebraska Legislature amid allegations of inappropriate conduct involving a woman who works for another lawmaker",
      "State Sen. Dan McKeon tearfully announced his resignation from the Nebraska Legislature on Tuesday ahead of scheduled debate to expel him from the body after accusations that he made a sexually charged comment to a legislative staffer and touched her inappropriately during a session-end party last year.",
      "McKeon, a Republican from rural south-central Nebraska who had served only a year before his resignation, announced his resignation and apologized on the legislative floor just minutes before debate that would certainly have included harsh condemnation of McKeon.",
      "\u201cMy words and actions were careless, regardless of the intent,\u201d McKeon said. \u201cI accept my responsibility for the impact of my words and my actions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis past year has humbled me. It requires reflection, listening and learning. Accountability is not only acknowledging my mistake but committing to grow from it. I take that responsibility seriously,\u201d McKeon said, his voice cracking.",
      "His demeanor was a departure from what many of his fellow lawmakers found to be a defiant and flippant attitude toward the accusations leading up to his resignation. McKeon's exit came a day after the 10-member Executive Board, the body's governing board, voted unanimously to forward a motion to expel McKeon to the full Legislature for a vote.",
      "The unprecedented move followed a complaint from the staffer who works for another lawmaker that McKeon approached her and another aide during a May 29 party and engaged in small talk about everyone's vacation plans. The woman said McKeon told her she should \u201cget laid\u201d on her vacation and patted her on her buttocks. McKeon has countered that he \u201cmade a bad pun,\" telling the woman she and her spouse should \u201cgo to Hawaii and enjoy a Hawaiian lei,\u201d according to McKeon's attorney.",
      "McKeon also countered that he patted the staffer on the back and may have accidentally brushed her rear end, but insists that if he did, it was unintentional.",
      "McKeon's departure comes as more attention has focused on sexual harassment within state legislatures nationwide \u2014 including in Nebraska. The accusations against McKeon came about 15 months after the body was thrown in chaos when another Republican state lawmaker, former Sen. Steve Halloran, read a graphic account of rape from a bestselling memoir on the floor of the Legislature in which he repeatedly invoked the name of a fellow lawmaker, making it appear as if that lawmaker was the subject of the assault.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Democratic National Committee will spend millions of dollars to cement control of voter registration efforts that have traditionally been entrusted to nonprofit advocacy groups and individual political campaigns, a shift that party leaders hope will increase their chances in this year's midterm elections.",
      "The initiative, being announced on Tuesday, will begin in Arizona and Nevada with at least $2 million for training organizers. It's the first step in what could become the DNC's largest-ever push to sign up new voters, with a particular focus on young people, voters of color and people without college educations. All of those demographics drifted away from Democrats in the last presidential race, which returned Republican Donald Trump to the White House.",

      "Researchers say the United States emitted 2.4% more greenhouse gases in 2025 than the previous year",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a reversal from previous years' pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released Tuesday.",
      "The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of data centers and cryptocurrency mining and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.",
      "American emissions of carbon dioxide and methane had dropped 20% from 2005 to 2024, with a few one- or two-year increases in the overall downward trend. Traditionally, carbon pollution has risen alongside economic growth, but efforts to boost cleaner energy in recent years decoupled the two, so emissions would drop as gross domestic product rose.",
      "But that changed last year with pollution actually growing faster than economic activity, said study co-author Ben King, a director in Rhodium's energy group. He estimated the U.S. put 5.9 billion tons (5.35 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139 million tons (126 million metric tons) more than in 2024.",
      "The cold 2025 winter meant more heating of buildings, which often comes from natural gas and fuel oil that are big greenhouse gas emitters, King said. A significant and noticeable jump in electricity demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining meant more power plants producing energy. That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.",
      "A rise in natural gas prices helped create an 13% increase in coal power, which had shrunk by nearly two-thirds since its peak in 2007, King said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a huge rebound,\u201d King said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sitting here claiming that coal is back and going to dominate the sector or anything like that. But we did see this increase and that was a large part of why emissions went up in the power sector.\u201d",
      "King said the list of more than two dozen proposed rollbacks of American environmental policies by the Trump administration hadn't been in place long enough to have an effect in 2025, but may be more noticeable in future years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one year of data so far,\u201d King said. \u201cSo we need to see the extent to which this trend sustains.\u201d",
      "Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of American power, Rhodium found. It will be interesting to see what happens as the Trump administration ends solar and wind subsidies and discourages their use, King said.",
      "\"The economic case for adding renewables is quite strong still,\" King said. \u201cThis stuff is cost-competitive in a lot of places. Try as they might, this administration can\u2019t alter the fundamental economics of this stuff.\u201d",

      "Others who were not involved in the Rhodium report said last year's increase in emissions is an ominous sign.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",

      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",

      "The United States is accusing Russia of a \u201cdangerous and inexplicable escalation\u201d of the nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United States accused Russia on Monday of a \u201cdangerous and inexplicable escalation\u201d of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.",
      "U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia\u2019s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine\u2019s border with Poland, a NATO ally.",
      "She told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores \u201cthe staggering number of casualties\u201d in the conflict and condemns Russia\u2019s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.",
      "Ukraine called for the meeting after last Thursday\u2019s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv\u2019s NATO allies.",
      "The large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.",
      "The attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.",
      "Moscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.",
      "Europe\u2019s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as \u201cescalatory and unacceptable,\u201d and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.",
      "\u201cAt a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump\u2019s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,\u201d she said. \u201cYet Russia\u2019s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics are sparking debate over federal agents' authority to enter private property",
      "As the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement nationwide, a wave of high-profile arrests \u2014 many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video \u2014 has pushed one legal question into the center of the national debate: When can federal immigration agents lawfully enter private property to make an arrest?",
      "That question has taken on new urgency in cities like Minneapolis, where thousands of federal agents are operating on the streets amid protests, confrontations and a fatal shooting, sharpening scrutiny of the legal authority immigration officers rely on when they arrive at the front door.",
      "At the heart of the debate is a legal distinction largely unfamiliar to the public but central to immigration enforcement.",
      "Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only criminal warrants signed by judges carry that authority. Legal experts say the administration\u2019s aggressive enforcement push, combined with public awareness of those limits, is increasingly turning door-knock encounters into flashpoints, fueling confrontations that are now playing out in cities across the country.",
      "Here is what to know about the limitations on the warrants that authorize most immigration related arrests.",
      "All law enforcement operations \u2014 including those conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection \u2014 are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means law enforcement is required to have a warrant before searching one's private property or arresting someone, regardless of immigration status.",
      "But not all warrants are the same. Typically, arrests carried out by Department of Homeland Security agencies are authorized by administrative warrants \u2014 sometimes known as immigration warrants \u2014 not judicial warrants.",
      "Judicial warrants are issued by a court and signed by a magistrate or a state or federal judge. These warrants allow a relevant law enforcement agency to apprehend a specified individual in any context \u2014 regardless of whether the person is on public or on private property. In other words, law enforcement is legally allowed to enter and search a home or business to make the arrest without the consent of the property owner once a judge signs off on the arrest.",
      "By contrast, the administrative warrants used in most immigration operations are sanctioned by an agency, officer or immigration judge, and don't allow law enforcement to forcibly enter private property to detain someone.",
      "That means people can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant.",
      "There are limited exceptions, some of which include if someone is in immediate danger, an officer is actively chasing a suspect or if someone is calling for help inside the residence. But those exceptions don't apply in routine immigration arrests, legal experts say.",
      "John Sandweg, a former ICE acting director, said officers are trained on what circumstances legally justify forced entry. But as the scope of ICE's work has expanded, and more Border Patrol agents have begun conducting the work of ICE officers, there is a greater chance that agents will misapply the rules, he said.",
      "\u201cYour risks of all of these types of incidents increase dramatically when you take officers out of their normal operating environment and ask them to do things that they have not been trained to do, because it\u2019s not part of their core missions,\u201d Sandweg said.",
      "The thorny legal distinction between judicial and administrative warrants came to the fore on Sunday when immigration law enforcement raided a private home to make an arrest in Minneapolis, after clashing with protesters who confronted the heavily armed agents. Documents reviewed by The Associated Press revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant \u2014 meaning there was no judge that authorized the raid on private property.",

      "When asked, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin didn't provide a legal justification for the forced entry and arrest of the man, who is a Liberian national with a deportation order from 2023. She said his arrest was part of the administration's efforts to arrest \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d and added that he had that a criminal history including \u201crobbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.\"",
      "McLaughlin didn't specify whether he was convicted of any of those crimes, or whether his arrest was related to any criminal activity.",
      "Vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, Heidi Altman, said she couldn\u2019t comment on that specific raid, but said that generally an officer entering a home without consent or permission could result in serious consequences.",
      "\u201cThat is not just an illegal arrest. It\u2019s numerous illegal actions by the officer themselves that could open up liability, not just for being sued, but potential criminal actions under state law as well,\u201d she explained.",
      "But in the current political climate, Altman said, it isn\u2019t clear if there are any realistic avenues for accountability since the federal government would be responsible for investigating such a breech.",
      "\u201cThere are layers of federal laws and regulations and policies prohibiting this kind of behavior. But then the second layer is: Is the federal government going to impose consequences?\" she said.",
      "On top of that, immigrants have less recourse after an illegal arrest or search, since the illegally obtained evidence can still be used in immigration court. It\u2019s called the exclusionary rule, Altman explained, and the consequences that the officer may face would not undo the immediate consequences immigrants could face if they are quickly deported.",
      "\u201cAs those legal challenges come and people are facing very, very quick detentions and deportations on the basis of these illegal arrests, there\u2019s very little recourse in actual immigration court proceedings that allows people to have a judge disregard evidence or the actual arrest, even if it was done in this very violent, illegal manner,\u201d Altman said.",
      "ICE has long relied on \u201cknock and talks\" to make apprehensions, informally requesting residents to leave a home without giving any indication they plan to make an immigration arrest. As outlined in a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal, officers tell their targets that they need them to step outside to answer a few questions. In one case, they told a woman that they were probation officers looking for her brother.",
      "In response, activists, lawyers and local governments have launched \u201cknow-your-rights\u201d campaigns around the country, attempting to educate people on the legal nuances of the extremely convoluted legal framework that is supposed to govern immigration law enforcement.",
      "Many groups have published fact sheets and infographics on social media, while others facilitate meetings that go over constitutional protections that immigrants have \u2014 regardless of legal status \u2014 in interactions with federal agents.",
      "Often groups will instruct immigrants to request to see a warrant before opening the door if an immigration officer knocks. The trainings also typically emphasize that an immigrant can refuse to open the door if law enforcement only has an administrative warrant.",

    "story": [
      "Timothy Busfield turned himself into police on Tuesday after authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant for the director and Emmy Award-winning actor accused of child sex abuse.",
      "A spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department confirmed to CBS News that Busfield had surrendered. He was booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Bernalillo County   on a child sex abuse charge. The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge was for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department on Friday filed a criminal complaint that alleged a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "In a video provided to TMZ, Busfield said the allegations \"are all lies.\"",
      "\"I did not do anything to those little boys,\" the 68-year-old actor said in the video appearing to show him in Albuquerque. He said he arrived in the city after driving 2,000 miles.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, Busfield's attorney, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said his client \"is innocent and is determined to clear his name,\" adding that \"the claims\" against Busfield are \"completely false.\"",
      "The criminal complaint states the boy reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him three or four times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him, the complaint said.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "When interviewed by authorities, Busfield suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. He also said he likely would have picked up and tickled the boys, saying the set was a playful environment.",
      "The mother of the twins \u2014 who are identified only by their initials in court records \u2014 reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It was produced by Warner Bros., which, according to the complaint, conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991. He is married to actor\u00a0Melissa Gilbert, who deactivated her Instagram account amid the allegations.",
      "Gilbert indicated through a publicist that she won't speak publicly at the request of attorneys for Busfield while the legal process unfolds.",
      "\"Her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.\"",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, one of the boys has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him.",

    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",

      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat.",

      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

      "\"Hamnet\" won Best Motion Picture - Drama, and \"One Battle After Another\" won Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. (See a full list of this year's winners here.)",
      "Here are the highlights and memorable moments from the Golden Globes, from historic wins to powerful speeches.",
      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",
      "Glaser closed out the night wearing a \"Spinal Tap\" hat and referencing several famous lines from the film directed by the late Rob Reiner.",

      "\"To my Brown sisters and little Brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,\" she said. \"Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter, and our dreams deserve space.\"",
      "Golden Globes get political",
      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As she accepted the award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in \"Hacks,\" Jean Smart wore a \"BE GOOD\" pin in honor of Renee Good, the woman who was killed by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis.",
      "\"Let's all do the right thing,\" Smart said. \"I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do.\"",
      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne also wore pins protesting ICE.",
      "Director Judd Apatow, while presenting an award, said \"I believe we're a dictatorship now,\" and then joked that he was still angrier about losing the Best Comedy award to Ridley Scott a decade ago.",
      "New award for best podcast",
      "For the first time, an award for best podcast was handed out. The nominees were: \"Armchair Expert,\" \"Call Her Daddy,\" \"Good Hang With Amy Poehler,\" \"The Mel Robbins Podcast,\" \"SmartLess\" and \"Up First.\"",
      "Amy Poehler took home the win.",
      "\"This is an attempt to try to make a very rough and unkind world filled with a little bit more love and laughter,\" Poehler said.",
      "She also praised her fellow nominees.",
      "\"I'm fans of all of you, except for NPR. Just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. So, try harder,\" Poehler joked.",
      "K-pop takes home a win",
      "Best original song went to \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters.\" Ejae, who wrote the lyrics and provided the singing voice for the film's character Rumi, accepted the award. As a child, she'd trained for years in hopes of becoming a K-pop star, only to face rejection, she said.",
      "\"I leaned on songs and music to get through it,\" Ejae said. \"Now I'm here, as a singer and a songwriter. It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone from all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.\"",
      "\"KPop Demon Hunters\" also won Best Animated Motion Picture and was nominated for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.",
      "\"I really wanted to depict female characters the way that we know women, which is really strong and bold, really silly and weird and really hungry for food, and sometimes a little thirsty,\" director Maggie Kang said after winning Best Animated Motion Picture.",
      "What did Snoop Dogg say?",
      "The sound dropped out for several seconds when Snoop Dogg, who was on stage to present the award for Best Podcast, said he was \"high as a motherf*****.\"",
      "Teyana Taylor and Erin Doherty were also briefly censored for cursing while accepting their awards.",
      "Wanda Sykes accepts award for Ricky Gervais",
      "Wanda Sykes, who was presenting the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy, said she hoped Gervais, who was not in attendance, would win.",

So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",

      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",

    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history is underway after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "\"NYSNA's leaders continue to double down on their $3.6 billion in reckless demands, including nearly 40% wage increases, and their troubling proposals like demanding that a nurse not be terminated if found to be compromised by drugs or alcohol while on the job. We remain resolute in our commitment to providing safe and seamless care, regardless of how long the strike may last,\" Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses -- and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "Some nurses, however, did report to work despite the strike. Mount Sinai said 20% showed up on Monday.",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Hochul also said she wants a deal made as soon as possible.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Some family members of patients are concerned as the strike continues on Monday night.",
      "Nurses can't pick up prescriptions at Montefiore Hospital",
      "A video shows one nurse being denied access to the Montefiore Weiler Hospital while trying to pick up prescriptions.",
      "The nurse said employees' health insurance is through Montefiore, and they can only pick up medications from a Montefiore pharmacy.",
      "\"Additionally, many nurses live in the Bronx, and their families get their care from Montefiore. If their family goes to the ER or is admitted, they're saying we can't go visit them,\" the nurse said in a statement.",
      "The woman in the video tells the security guard she is contracted to receive medications only through this pharmacy.",
      "The guard says they should've made arrangements to pick up the medication before, as they knew the strike was happening on Monday.",
      "A Montefiore spokesperson said nurses who are on strike can request their prescriptions be delivered directly to their homes.",
      "\"NYSNA nurses are able to attend any medical appointments scheduled at the medical center during the strike, as well as visit any family members who are inpatients, as long as they can provide proper documentation,\" a statement read.",

    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration's tariffs caused a \"few-billion-dollar impact,\" but also praised them for \"leveling the playing field.\"",
    "story": [
      "As General Motors settles into its new Detroit headquarters, the automotive industry is facing challenging times as it contends with rising costs, shifting tariff policies and a fledgling electric vehicle market. GM CEO Mary Barra tells CBS News that, despite those challenges, \"I think we're on a good path\" and she is optimistic about the future of her company and the U.S. economy.",
      "The market for electric vehicles hasn't quite taken off in the U.S. just yet. Barra told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil Tuesday that GM is \"still committed\" to EVs, but thinks a major issue is that the industry was \"getting a little ahead of the consumer.\"",
      "\"A vehicle is such a big purchase for a consumer,\" she said. \"For many of them, it's the most expensive thing that they buy.\"",
      "\"I think we're on a good path. I think as there's more charging infrastructure, as we continue to get the cost of batteries down, I think consumers will pick an electric vehicle, because they're better,\" Barra predicted.",
      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do. We focus on that, and we look at how do we make each of our team members more efficient.\"",
      "She also noted there are some instances in which \"the precision of the job requires automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-inflation-december-2025-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:23:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

      "President Trump blasted Jerome Powell as a \"lousy\" Federal Reserve chair for failing to more aggressively lower interest rates, while also taking him to task for an ongoing construction project at the central bank.",
      "\"He's been a lousy Fed chairman,\" Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in an exclusive network interview Tuesday in Dearborn, Michigan. \"He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes.\"",

      "The costs of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building have swelled to $2.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. Mr. Trump said in the interview that he \"could have fixed them up for $25 million\" and said Powell is \"either corrupt or incompetent.\"",

      "\"I can't help what it looks like,\" Mr. Trump told Dokoupil.",
      "Powell on Sunday attributed the Justice Department investigation to Fed officials resisting pressure from Mr. Trump to lower its benchmark interest rate.

      "The top job for 2026: cardiac medical technician. The number of listings for the role on Indeed's website has surged 34% since 2022, while wages have grown by the same amount.

    "summary": "Capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save consumers billions of dollars, but potentially hurt lower-income Americans, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year could save consumers billions of dollars but hurt Americans with lower credit scores, according to financial experts.",
      "The idea, which drew rare support on Monday from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would prevent Americans from being \"ripped off\" by card issuers, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0last week in calling for the rate ceiling. By contrast, the cap has drawn pushback from the banking industry.",
      "After JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would punish consumers and dent the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The average interest rate on credit cards is now nearly 24%, according LendingTree. People with poor credit scores, meanwhile, can pay rates of up to 36%.",
      "Here's how experts say a 10% cap could affect consumers.",
      "Potential tradeoffs",
      "A September 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0from researchers at Vanderbilt University found that a 10% cap on credit card rates would save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments.",
      "With rates at 10%, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance would pay about $42 per month in interest. At the current average rate of 24%, they would owe about $100 per month.",
      "Some credit card analysts, along with the banking industry, contend that a 10% cap on credit card rates could lead to banks cutting off access to credit for low-income consumers and for those with low credit scores.",
      "\"They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.",
      "That could take a toll on the broader economy because subprime consumers would likely pare their spending or turn to pricier types of credit. Credit card spending accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5%, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "For overall economic growth, that would effectively cancel out any increase in consumer spending stemming from lower credit card rates, the investment bank notes.",
      "The American Bankers Association also said in a statement\u00a0that a 10% rate cap \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" such as payday\u00a0or \"buy now pay later\" loans.",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, a site that helps consumers maximize their credit card rewards, said such programs could be diminished if the cap is implemented.",
      "\"Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Yet Shearer disputes claims that capping rates would cause card companies to cut off some consumers, forcing them to turn to riskier types of loans. Rather, credit card issuers are more likely to continue serving such consumers, but could sharply reduce the value of the rewards they offer them, he said.",
      "\"The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,\" he said, noting that credit card issuers have a range of revenue streams.",
      "Issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also make money by charging annual fees and on so-called interchange fees merchants pay to accept credit cards, which wouldn't be affected by the proposed rate cap.",
      "\"Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,\" Shearer said.",
      "Why are credit card rates so high?",
      "Annual percentage rates (APR on credit cards are far higher than auto loan or mortgage rates because the debt is unsecured, Rossman explained.",
      "\"There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,\" he told CBS News. \"The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back,\" he added, explaining the rationale behind double-digit interest rates.",
      "Card companies are also reluctant to reduce rates because that would mean smaller profits.",
      "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how much card issuers can increase rates, but does not put a cap on rates, while also reducing late payment and other fees.",
      "Can Trump really do this?",
      "Some experts think Trump may not have the authority to unilaterally impose a cap on credit card rates. Congress would also face challenges implementing such a cap, according to TD Cowan analyst Jaret Seiberg, although he thinks lawmakers could get behind a higher cap.",
      "\"This is where the risk rises as Democrats have sought to extend the 36% military lending cap to all consumers. It is why that could pass. Enacting a 25% cap would be harder as it could affect first-time credit card holders and subprime applicants,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Shearer said that a bipartisan\u00a0bill, the \"Percent Credit Card Interest Rate Cap Act,\" introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025 could pass if Mr. Trump's allies rallied behind it.",
      "\"It's not going to happen through executive action,\" Shearer said of a cap on interest rates. \"But if he can get the Senate majority leader and speaker to put it up for a vote, it's quite possible the bill would pass.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:25:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump defended his tariffs at a speech in Michigan, after he visited a factory in Dearborn.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump spoke Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club after he toured a Ford truck plant in nearby Dearborn. It comes as the president tries to focus on economic issues amid myriad international and domestic events that have gripped his administration since the start of the year.",
      "As Mr. Trump took to the stage, he touted the economy and also his victory in the 2024 election in Michigan. Mr. Trump called the event the \"easiest speech I've had to make\" because \"all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended his administration's tariffs, saying he had closed the trade deficit due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Tariff's my favorite word,\" Mr. Trump said, later amending that it's his \"fifth-favorite word.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said tariffs had helped the car industry in Michigan, a point he also made while in Dearborn.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be rolling out a plan to deal with affordability when he is at Davos, although he has said that affordability is a \"hoax.\"",
      "On the international front, Mr. Trump spoke about his administration's military strikes on Venezuela and capture of its former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He attacked the Democrats who voted to advance a war powers resolution, saying they \"hate our country,\" and he also called out a few of the Republicans who joined them.",
      "Mr. Trump met with oil executives to push for U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil industry, and he said Monday that \"we're working with the Venezuelan people and representatives, and it's amazing\" for the country's oil.",
      "Veering off topic from the economy, Mr. Trump said, starting Feb. 1, his administration would cut off all payments to sanctuary cities and \"states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens, and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come.\" Previous attempts to cut off funding from sanctuary cities have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized the fraud scandal in Minnesota involving dozens of Somali-American defendants, trashing Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, a staunch critic of Mr. Trump who represents Minneapolis and is Somali-American, saying she \"comes from a country with nothing and she comes here and she tells us about our Constitution.\"",
      "Walz last week dropped his reelection bid amid scrutiny over fraud in the state and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Trump said the recent immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which began shortly after a conservative YouTuber late last month published a video with\u00a0further allegations of fraud, has been successful in \"finding hundreds\" of criminals, and \"all we want to do is get them out.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get them out because they make it so impossible for you,\" he said. \"And you wonder, why? Why would they do that? You know, do they want to live with murderers, do they want to live with these people that are emptied out from prisons?\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention Renee Good, an American citizen who last week was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Mr. Trump and other high-ranking officials in his administration have repeatedly insisted the ICE officer was justified and that Good had instigated the shooting. Local officials and video footage of the incident have cast doubt on some of their claims.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil during his visit to Dearborn about the economy and other issues. The interview will air on \"CBS Evening News\" tonight.",
      "On the economy, the December jobs report released last week continued to show a softening economy, with only 50,000 jobs added in December. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November.",
      "Overall for 2025, job growth slowed throughout the year as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring.",
      "In a prime-time address last month,\u00a0Mr. Trump defended some of his signature second-term economic policies, including his handling of inflation and tariffs.",
      "The Detroit Economic Club has a long history of hosting presidents, both Democrats and Republicans. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have all previously spoken to club members.",

    "summary": "Roughly 1.4 million fewer Americans have signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan as expiring tax breaks drive up premiums.",
    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, a 2023 Urban Institute\u00a0study\u00a0found.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

      "U.S. prosecutors have opened an inquiry into Powell, prompting his rare rebuke against escalating pressure from President Trump's administration to lower interest rates.",
      "\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" said the statement signed by heads of the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and others, including the central banks of Australia, Brazil, Canada and South Korea.",
      "\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest. To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him,\" the statement said.",
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department on Friday stemming from an\u00a0investigation into its chair\u00a0over the cost of building renovations, Powell said in a video statement shared on Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, during which he spoke about a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings, according to Powell.",
      "He said in his video statement that the move by the Department of Justice should, however, be \"seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project.

    "story": [
      "Three former chairs of the Federal Reserve and other top former economic officials are rebuking the Department of Justice for launching an\u00a0investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, saying the probe will undermine the central bank's independence and hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "The statement, posted on Substack on Monday, was signed by former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, as well as by former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin.",
      "\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the signers of the statement said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.",
      "President Trump has pushed the Fed to more aggressively cut interest rates, arguing that the U.S. economy would benefit from lower borrowing costs.",
      "A fight over independence",
      "Powell has long defended the central bank's independence\u00a0on the grounds that shielding the Fed from political influence allows monetary policy makers to make objective decisions based on economic data, rather than the interests of elected officials.",
      "Justice Department subpoenas to the Fed threaten a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in\u00a0June 2025, Powell said in a video statement on Sunday.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "Other former senior economic officials to sign the statement: Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under former President Joe Biden; Jason Furman, CEA chair under former President Barack Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, who both led the CEA under former President George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund; ad Christina Romer, CEA chair under Obama.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the signers wrote.",
      "The statement signals that \"folks are unifying against this,\" Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Whether it changes the administration's mind is a tough question because it's a new source of pressure. But at the same time, it might amplify their resolve in seeing that the establishment is against this, so we must be right.\"",
      "Why Powell says he's being targeted",
      "The $2.5 billion project to renovate several Fed buildings, along with Powell's testimony about that effort, came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Powell had called some descriptions of the renovation \"misleading and inaccurate,\" disputing claims by the Trump administration that the overhaul included water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "In his video remarks on Sunday, Powell tied the investigation to Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates and undermine the central bank's independence.",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role. The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate three times since Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with Mr. Powell citing easing inflation and a slower labor market as causes for the reductions.",
      "Lawmakers across the aisle spoke out in defense of Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Banking panel, said on Sunday that he would oppose any of the Trump administration's nominees for the Fed, including to replace Powell.",
      "\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the investigation \"nothing more than an attempt at coercion.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Monday that \"Trump is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.\"",
      "Powell's future at the Fed",
      "Powell is set to step down as Fed chair in May, but he could continue to serve as a Federal Reserve governor beyond that time. If he remains, the Trump administration would be deprived of the chance to fill another seat on the board.",
      "Powell has declined at several press conferences to answer questions about his plans. Asked on Monday by reporters if Powell planned to remain a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a leading candidate to become Fed chair, said he was unaware of Powell's plans.",
      "\"I've not talked to Jay about that,\" Hassett said.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has also called on another Fed official, Lisa Cook, to step down. Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed\u00a0as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, claimed Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Mattel is introducing a Barbie with autism as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity.",
    "story": [
      "Mattel Inc. is introducing a Barbie with autism Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways people with autism may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \"autism doesn't look any one way,\" Pervez said. \"But we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\"",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some people with autism use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some people with autism wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",
      "Each doll comes with a pink finger clip fidget spinner, noise-canceling headphones and a pink tablet modeled after the devices some people with autism who struggle to speak use to communicate.",
      "The addition of the doll with autism to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company's employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the community of people with autism that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\"Barbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we're proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\" Jamie Cygielman, Mattel's global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, with the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",

      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",

      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time.

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

      "The monthly job gains were below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.",
      "Payroll gains were revised downward for both October and November, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously reported in those months. The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",
      "In December, hiring was robust in food services and drinking, health care and social assistance, while the retail sector shed jobs, the BLS said.",
      "Most layoffs since 2020",
      "Employers announced 1.2 million job cuts in 2025, a 58% increase from the prior year and the highest level since 2020, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday.",
      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",
      "What it means",
      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",

    "summary": "Britain's leader says all options on the table if Musk's X platform doesn't stop Grok AI tool being used to generate non-consensual sexualized images.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "summary": "Judge David Novak had given Lindsey Halligan a week to explain why she is using the title of U.S. attorney after another federal judge found her appointment to the position invalid.",
    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department officials defended Lindsey Halligan's attempts to remain in her position as a U.S. attorney in court filings Tuesday, responding to a federal judge who demanded to know why she was continuing to do so after another judge had found that her appointment was invalid.",
      "The filing, signed by Halligan, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, accused a Trump-appointed judge of \"gross abuse of power,\" and attempting to \"coerce the Executive Branch into conformity.\"",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits on the federal bench in Richmond, ordered Halligan to provide the basis for her repeated use of the title of U.S. attorney and explain why it \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\"",
      "Novak\u00a0gave Halligan\u00a0seven days to respond to his order and brief on why he \"should not strike Ms. Halligan's identification as United States attorney\" after she listed herself on an indictment returned in the Eastern District of Virginia in December as a \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie had ruled in November that Halligan's\u00a0appointment as interim U.S. attorney\u00a0was invalid and violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, and she dismissed the cases Halligan had brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. After that, the interim U.S. attorney may be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "Currie found that the 120-day clock began when Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert was initially appointed in January 2025. Currie concluded that when that timeframe expired, Bondi's authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney expired along with it.",
      "The judge ruled that Halligan had been serving unlawfully since Sept. 22 and concluded that \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment\" had to be set aside. That included the Comey and James indictments.",
      "In their response, Bondi, Blanche and Halligan called Novak's move an \"inquisition,\" \"insult,\" and a \"cudgel\" against the executive branch. The Justice Department argued that Currie's ruling in November applied only to the Comey and James cases and did not bar Halligan from calling herself U.S. attorney in other cases that she oversees.",
      "\"Adding insult to error, [Novak's order] posits that the United States' continued assertion of its legal position that Ms. Halligan properly serves as the United States Attorney amounts to a factual misrepresentation that could trigger attorney discipline. The Court's thinly veiled threat to use attorney discipline to cudgel the Executive Branch into conforming its legal position in all criminal prosecutions to the views of a single district judge is a gross abuse of power and an affront to the separation of powers,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "In his earlier order, Novak said that Currie's decision \"remains binding precedent in this district and is not subject to being ignored.\"",
      "The Justice Department called Currie's ruling \"erroneous\": and said that Halligan is entitled to maintain her position \"notwithstanding a single district judge's contrary view.\"",
      "On Monday, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Robert McBride, was fired after he refused to help lead the\u00a0Justice Department's prosecution\u00a0of Comey, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News. McBride is a former longtime federal prosecutor in Kentucky's Eastern District and had only been on the job as first assistant U.S. attorney for a few months after joining the office in the fall.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team, and joined Mr. Trump's White House staff after he won a second term in 2024. In September, Halligan was selected to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after her predecessor abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Just days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and pursued several arguments to have their respective indictments dismissed, including the validity of Halligan's appointment, and claims of vindictive prosecution.",

      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" he added. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "But leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is\u00a0considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"One thing must be clear to everyone: Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States. Greenland does not want to be part of the United States,\" Nielsen said Tuesday.",
      "Denmark has been one of the U.S.' staunchest NATO allies for more than 75 years. Frederiksen said of the U.S. there's been \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Senate Democrats and a few Republicans have expressed opposition to military action against Greenland. Democratic Sen.

Five Republicans joined all the Democrats in advancing the resolution, indicating a lack of support for any military action in Greenland. Democratic Sen.

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here are the major takeaways from President Trump's interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Iran, Renee Good, the Federal Reserve and more.",
    "story": [
      "In an interview with CBS News, President Trump issued a warning to Iran, weighed in on the ICE shooting in Minneapolis \u2014 and reiterated he believes his power as president is primarily limited by his own morality.",
      "Here are the major takeaways from Mr. Trump's interview at a Ford factory in Dearborn, Michigan, with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil:",
      "Trump's goal in Iran: \"The endgame is to win\"",
      "At least 12,000 people have been killed in the crackdown on a nationwide wave of protests in Iran, two sources told CBS News on Tuesday \u2014 a far higher death toll than reported by activists outside the country.",
      "Mr. Trump told CBS News \"nobody's been able to give us accurate numbers,\" but he said it looks like the death toll could be \"pretty substantial\" and \"that's going to be a lot of problems for them.\"",
      "He also vowed to intervene if Iran starts hanging protesters, telling Dokoupil, \"We will take very strong action if they do such a thing.\"",
      "The president has repeatedly warned that he may intervene in Iran. He hasn't specified what action he might take, but he and his administration have pointedly not ruled out using military force. Mr. Trump has been briefed on a wide array of military and covert tools that could be used against Iran, including conventional airstrikes as well as cyber operations and psychological campaigns, CBS News has reported.",
      "His ultimate goal in Iran?",
      "\"The endgame is to win,\" the president said. \"I like winning.\"",
      "Asked how he defines \"winning,\" Mr. Trump rattled off a list of prior military operations that he has ordered, including the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, last summer's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and, in his first term, the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.",
      "\"We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing, when they start killing thousands of people, and now you're telling me about hanging \u2014 we'll see how that works out for them. It's not going to work out good.\"",
      "Trump's message to voters who want him to focus on them, not foreign policy",
      "Asked what he'd say to Trump voters who'd rather have his attention focused on issues at home, rather than abroad, Mr. Trump told Dokoupil, \"We have the strongest economy, maybe in the history of our country,\" pointing to auto plant expansion and 24-hour production lines at Ford, Stellantis and GM.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" he said, referencing Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report, which showed prices rising at an annual rate of 2.7% in December, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from November. \"Our growth numbers are through the roof. Our job numbers are tremendous.\"",
      "The president argued that he has been primarily focused on domestic issues, but \"you can't be forgetting about bad threats,\" naming the risk of a nuclear Iran.",
      "\"So my focus is very much on this country,\" he said, \"but you can't lose sight of the fact that we need peace all over the world.\"",
      "Trump predicts people will start feeling better about the economy soon",
      "Mr. Trump has touted his economic record \u2014 but polls suggest most Americans aren't feeling it. Last month, 63% of adults disapproved of the president's handling of the economy, and 50% said his policies are making them financially worse off, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "And while overall inflation is well below 2022 levels and within striking distance of the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target, there are some pain points, with ground beef prices jumping 15.5% over the last year and coffee prices surging 19.8%.",
      "Mr. Trump said the inflation numbers are \"overall very good. Good for us, good for our country.\"",
      "When asked by Dokoupil why Americans say they don't feel that way, Mr. Trump said \"they might not, but they're going to now.\"",
      "\"The first few months were really rough if you look at 'em, because I inherited a mess,\" he said. \"\"...And now we have the hottest country in the world.\"",
      "Trump calls Jerome Powell \"either corrupt or incompetent\"",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just two days after the central bank leader revealed that the Fed had received subpoenas from the Justice Department in what Powell alleged was an act of political intimidation.",
      "The subpoenas focused on a pricey renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. But Mr. Trump has long criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "Mr. Trump called Powell a \"lousy Fed chairman.\" He blamed former President Joe Biden for reappointing Powell to a second term as Fed chief, after Mr. Trump initially picked Powell for the role during the first Trump administration.",
      "And on the renovation project, Mr. Trump alleged Powell is \"either corrupt or incompetent.\" (There is no evidence of corruption on Powell's part in the Fed's office renovation.)",
      "When pressed on the appearance that Powell is a victim of political retribution, the president responded: \"I can't help what it looks like,\" and touted his economic record.",
      "Trump's message to Renee Good's father",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has accused Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week, of committing domestic terrorism, and federal prosecutors are facing pressure to investigate the case as an assault on a federal officer.",
      "Dokoupil asked the president if he had a message for Good's father, a Trump supporter who's heartbroken over the labeling of his daughter as a domestic terrorist.",
      "\"I want to say to the father that I love all of our people,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But, you know,\u00a0her actions were pretty tough.\"",
      "He said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers' jobs are \"being made very, very difficult\" as they try to remove what Mr. Trump claims are \"hundreds of thousands of murderers\" from the country.",
      "He said that when looking at the video footage of the shooting, \"it can be viewed two ways, I guess,\" but added, \"there were a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.\"",
      "Trump predicts robots will be \"great\" for U.S. workforce",
      "Auto manufacturing is being remade by advanced robotics \u2014 stoking excitement about increased productivity and fears that robots could make human assembly line workers obsolete.",
      "The president touched on that issue with Dokoupil, predicting that robots will be \"a big factor in the future,\" helping with shortages of skilled workers.",
      "Asked about the risk of job losses, the president said, \"a skilled worker, a person with talent, education in what they do \u2026 they're gonna make a lotta money.\"",
      "\"I think that robotics are gonna be great because this country won't have enough people if we don't have it,\" he said.",
      "Trump: \"I'm a moral person\"",
      "The president raised eyebrows last week when he told The New York Times he believes the only limit on his power is his \"own morality.\"",
      "When asked how that applies to power domestically, he told Dokoupil: \"I'm a moral person. I don't like seeing death. I don't like seeing our people hurt.\"",
      "\"So, yeah, it's limited by my morality. And I have a very high rate of morality, so therefore it's limited,\" the president continued.",
      "Mr. Trump was asked if he believes the courts and the Constitution constrain him, too.",
      "\"Well, the Constitution, of course, that goes without saying,\" he responded. \"But you're asking me, what really can stop \u2014 we'll never get to the courts, we'll never get to the Constitution, because \u2026 I want to see what's good for our country. And you know what? The courts want to see that, too.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is revoking the legal status of more than 1,000 immigrants from Somalia, raising the specter of deportation for a community often assailed by President Trump.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official said the Trump administration had decided to terminate Somalia's Temporary Protected Status program, which allows beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation.",
      "Nationals of Somalia enrolled in the TPS program are now set to lose their legal status and work permits on March 17. The DHS official said roughly 2,500 Somali immigrants with TPS or pending applications are expected to be affected by the termination. A notice by the federal government said 1,082 Somalis were enrolled in TPS as of Dec. 8 and another 1,383 had applied for the program.",
      "The Trump administration has urged TPS holders whose status will lapse to self-deport, warning that they will be found, arrested and deported if they fail to do so.",
      "\"Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. \"Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.\"",
      "The move had been previewed last year by Mr. Trump, who has focused intensely on members of the Somali community, often describing them in derogatory terms. In a Cabinet meeting in December, Mr. Trump referred to people from Somalia as \"garbage,\" claiming they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his aides have focused particularly on Minnesota, home to the largest community of Somali immigrants and Somali-Americans. Citing a massive fraud scandal in the state implicating members of the Somali community, the administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area.",
      "The federal deployment has sparked clashes and protests, especially after the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "TPS dates back to 1990, when Congress created the policy to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from countries facing an armed conflict, environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.",
      "The second Trump administration has sought to end most TPS programs, which were dramatically expanded under former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump's administration has moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates have strongly denounced the administration's actions, saying they punish people from crisis-stricken countries who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and, in some cases, decades.",
      "But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature. It has also argued conditions in some of the affected countries have improved or that it's not in the national interest to renew protections for their nationals, criticizing TPS as a magnet for illegal immigration.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that the decision affects\u00a0roughly 2,500 Somali immigrants with TPS or pending applications.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as \"Havana Syndrome,\" which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of \"Havana Syndrome,\" a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",

And that was a complete obliteration, as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it and they said, you know, Trump was right. So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people. And now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that works out for them. It's not going to work out good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: There's so much going on overseas. Understandably, a lot of your focus has been on other countries. But when I talk to Americans, when I talk to your own voters, they want your focus to be on them, and they feel like it may be drifting. What do you have to say to them?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Tony, we have the strongest economy maybe in the history of our country. If you went around this plant, like I have, they just announced they're going to 24 hours. This is a Ford plant, but GM's the same, Stellantis is the same. They're going 24 hours all around the clock. They're enlarging every plant in this country. We're building more plants in the country than we've ever built. There's no inflation. You saw the inflation numbers have-- inflation's very low.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It seemed bad on groceries--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. Our growth numbers are through the roof. Our job numbers are tremendous. We have the highest stock market we've ever had. Today we hit-- every day for the last, I think, 48 times out of 11 months, 48 days out of 11 months, we've had the number one stock market in the history of our country. So my big focus is here. But you-- you can't be forgetting about bad threats. You can't be forgetting about an Iran with a nuclear weapon. You can't forget that there's tremendous wealth in the Middle East, and a lot of that wealth is coming over here to build plants. Saudi Arabia's giving us $2 trillion. Qatar is giving us $2 trillion. UAE is giving us $2 trillion. All of that is for the good of this country. So my focus is very much on this country, and-- but you can't lose sight of the fact that we need peace all over the world.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, what do you say to that accusation?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As you grow older in this position, you have to mention the other side. More people like it than not. He's been a lousy Fed chairman. He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes. He's been too high on interest rates, and I call him 'too late.' He's too late to reduce. He should have reduced 'em by more. Despite that, we fought through that. In addition, he heads up a construction situation on a rebuilding of a little building, two little buildings in-- called the Fed.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't help what it looks like. Look, I've created the greatest economy maybe in history, and you're seeing that now. Plants are being built all over the country.

But, you know, her actions were pretty tough. And I've seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms. But the bottom line is, look, we have hundreds of thousands of murderers in our countries, killers. ICE is trying to get them out. They were let in through an open border policy of sleepy Joe Biden. ICE is working very hard to get them out. Their job is being made very, very difficult. And, you know, when you look at that tape, it-- it can be viewed two ways, I guess. But when you look at the way that was-- that car was pulled away-- there were a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they might not, but they're going to now. I've only been here for 11 months, okay? And, you know, the first few months were really rough if you look at 'em, because I inherited a mess. I inherited a mess of crime. I inherited a mess of inflation. I inherited a mess of places closing up and going to other countries. And now we have the hottest country in the world. Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?",

You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world.

Now, what's gonna happen is people are being trained rapidly, and you're gonna have a thing called robots. And robots are gonna be a big factor. I predict--",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Why do you think--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, that's a positive question you asked me. I don't think you asked it in that way, but we are doing so well right now that we're training people to take those jobs. One other thing, we terminated many federal jobs. Those federal-- because that's a good thing. Because they wanna go private. The way you make our country great is you can't have too many federal workers, all right? Those workers are being trained to go into the private sector at a much higher salary.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, that's what the CEO said.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm-- well, you said that. And then you said the opposite in front of me. You can't have it both ways. Look, we're gonna need help, because we're expanding so rapidly that we need-- people are gonna make a lotta money. A skilled worker, a person with talent, education in what they do, not education in nuclear physics, education in what they do, they're gonna make a lotta money. Federal workers, they're leaving the federal government where you had ten people for every job. And they're going out and they're going into the private sector at two and three times the salary. And you see that all over. So I only say this: I think that robotics are gonna be great because this country won't have enough people if we don't have it.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our people are gonna be trained and they're gonna make more money than they've ever made before.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question, I think you'll be in- I was very interested in a comment you made recently about nothing being able to limit your action overseas except for your own morality and your own mind. I'd like to take that same question and apply it here in the U.S. Is there anything that limits your power, your movement, your action here other than your own morality?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I talk about morality. I'm a moral person. I don't like seeing death. I don't like seeing our people hurt. I don't like seeing the other side hurt either. You know, when we went into Venezuela we lost nobody, but a lot of people on the other side were-- were killed. I don't like that. Somebody else would say, \"Oh, that's wonderful.\" I don't like that. So yeah, it's limited by my morality. And I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it's limited.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not the Constitution, not the courts? That's what I thought you were gonna say.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the Constitution of course. That goes without saying. But you're asking me what really can stop-- we'll never get to the courts, we'll never get to the Constitution, because I don't-- I wanna see what's good for our country. And you know what? The courts wanna see that too.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Mr. President, thank you very much.",

      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's office \u2014 including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson \u2014 have resigned as the office continues to face pressure to treat the investigation of the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE officer as an assault on a federal officer case.",
      "Thompson also previously served as the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota; he was appointed by President Trump in June and served in the position until October. He resigned from the attorney's office along with Harry Jacobs, Melinda Williams, Thomas Calhoun-Lopez, Ruth Schneider and Tom Hollenhurst.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News the resignations stemmed from concern over a request to probe Good's widow \u2014 who was with her when they encountered the ICE agents \u2014 as well as the way that the case is being treated as an assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case.",
      "Thompson was the lead prosecutor in the Feeding Our Future case, a COVID-era $250 million scheme which targeted programs that were meant to feed schoolchildren. Since then he's charged defendants for allegedly defrauding housing and autism service programs, claiming that fraud in Minnesota has topped $9 billion, a figure which Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has pushed back on.",
      "The New York Times reported Tuesday that a number of people familiar with Thompson's decision said he also objected to federal investigators refusing to cooperate with Minnesota state agencies in investigating Good's killing.",
      "Doug Kelley, a former assistant U.S. attorney for Minnesota, says the move is a major blow to the credibility of the office moving forward.",
      "\"I've been practicing federal criminal law in this state for 51 years and this is the darkest day in 51 years as far as I can see for the rule of law in Minnesota,\" Kelley said. \"If they feel the need to resign because of orders they have gotten that will violate their consciouses, to me it's a great statement on their part that this is not tolerable by them.\"",
      "Since the massive fraud scandal, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Minnesota's large Somali-American community, as many of the Feeding Our Future defendants are of Somali descent. His administration cited the fraud scandal as impetus for deploying thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area.",
      "Walz called Thompson's resignation a \"huge loss for our state.\"",
      "\"It's also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants,\" Walz said on X.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar said on X that \"these career public servants have served our state through multiple tragedies and critical investigations. We cannot allow prosecutors to be driven by politics. The family and loved ones of Renee Good deserve justice, not political attacks.\"",

The ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good has been identified as Jonathan Ross, who a DHS source told CBS News last week was previously dragged by a car when trying to arrest a man in Bloomington, Minnesota, six months ago.",
      "Although the Justice Department contemplated treating the investigation as a \"color of law\" civil rights investigation into the excessive use of force, it later changed course, two different sources briefed on the matter told CBS.",
      "Now, the investigation is being treated as an assault on a federal officer, in which Ross, as opposed to Good, is seen as the victim of a crime, the sources added.",
      "CBS could not immediately determine who made that decision.",
      "At least six career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota have also resigned from their jobs, CBS also reported on Tuesday.",
      "Their resignations come as the office faces pressure from senior department leadership to treat the investigation as an assault on a federal officer, rather than a civil rights investigation.",
      "\"There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CBS in a statement.",
      "A Justice Department official confirmed to CBS that leadership in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section gave notice they were going to depart under an early retirement program, and said they sought to participate \"well before the events in Minnesota.\"",
      "\"Any suggestion to the contrary is false,\" the official added.",
      "Several sources told CBS that while most of those departing in the Civil Rights Division criminal section are taking the early retirement option, the timing of the events in Minneapolis factored into their decision to make the announcement this week.",
      "Video footage shows the officer, identified in court records from the prior incident as Ross, fired three rounds at the car as Good started to drive away.",
      "The video also appeared to depict the officers did not take immediate steps to ensure that Good received emergency medical care after the shooting took place. A separate video from the scene showed officers stopping a man who claimed to be a doctor from moving toward Good.",
      "Senior officials in the Trump administration, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have publicly sought to cast blame on Good, alleging she was trying to assault Ross with her car.",
      "But some legal experts say the video evidence shows that the car was turning away from Ross and that is sufficient to justify investigating the case as a civil rights one.",
      "\"Just looking at the totality of the evidence that I see, which is limited, there is enough there to make a criminal inquiry to determine whether there was deprivation of Ms. Good's rights under color of law,\" Julius Nam, a former federal civil rights prosecutor in Los Angeles, told CBS in an interview last week.",
      "The Civil Rights Division has already faced a mass exodus in its ranks since last year, after political leadership drastically altered its mission of historically protecting the country's most vulnerable populations.",
      "Until now, the criminal section had lost fewer attorneys compared with the division's other sections, which collectively lost approximately 75% of their staff in 2025.",
      "The departures, which include that of the section's chief, were not solely driven by Minneapolis, but also by frustrations at how political leaders in the division were handling other cases and sidelining prosecutors, two of the sources said.",
      "Last year, for example, political leadership in the division intervened in a pending sentencing of a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights and assigned a new prosecutor to the case who then asked a federal judge to sentence him to serve just one day in prison.",
      "The judge ultimately sentenced him to serve 33 months.",
      "Then in November, the division abruptly filed a motion to dismiss a case that was just about to go to trial against two officials in a local sheriff's office in the Middle District of Tennessee who were facing charges for using excessive force and trying to hide their alleged misconduct.",
      "Officials in the section were recently offered a chance to retire early,\u00a0 and several of them decided to take it, several of the sources said. The lack of an investigation in Minneapolis was a breaking point for some of them and helped factor into their decision to announce it in a staff meeting, several of the sources added.",
      "The Civil Rights Division's criminal section is responsible for prosecuting hate crimes, as well as cases against law enforcement such as excessive use of force, sexual misconduct, making false arrests or showing deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.",
      "In a statement, NAACP President Derrick Johnson said that if incidents that are visible like the Minneapolis shooting \"are not subjected to full, impartial investigations that genuinely seek accountability, we must wonder how many other cases go unreported, undocumented, or purposefully obscured by an administration that is no longer attempting to conceal its intent to intimidate and silence all who do not conform to its agenda.\"",
      "Although U.S. Attorney's offices can also conduct their own investigations into excessive force by a law enforcement officer, the incident in Minneapolis would likely be deemed to be a case of national significance under Justice Department guidelines because it resulted in death.",
      "In cases of national significance, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division is supposed to coordinate with the local U.S. Attorney's office, the Justice Manual says.",
      "One of the most high-profile civil rights prosecutions by the section in recent years took place in Minneapolis, after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in May 2020.",
      "Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, Floyd's constitutional rights, as well as the rights of a 14-year-old boy in an unrelated case from 2021.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-transgender-athlete-bans-oral-argument/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:54:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard two cases involving laws from Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to uphold state laws that\u00a0ban transgender athletes\u00a0from participating in girls' and women's sports, wading for the first time into the contentious issue.",
      "The justices heard more than three hours of arguments in a pair of cases challenging laws from West Virginia and Idaho that require public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated based on biological sex at birth and restrict transgender girls and women from competing on teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "Across the arguments, the justices debated the level of scientific evidence behind whether transgender athletes who have received gender-transition treatments hold any athletic advantage over female competitors, as well as whether the laws discriminate based on sex and transgender status, as two transgender athletes who challenged their states' measures argue.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court could have ramifications for more than half the country: Idaho and West Virginia are among the 27 states that have enacted laws in recent years that forbid participation by transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The two transgender athletes who brought the cases, Lindsay Hecox of Idaho and Becky Pepper-Jackson of West Virginia, filed lawsuits challenging the laws in their respective states several years ago, arguing that they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs. The bans, the athletes said, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, and treat them worse than their peers. Lower courts ruled in favor of Hecox and Pepper-Jackson.",
      "But Idaho and West Virginia officials asserted that their bans do not discriminate based on transgender status and draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. They said that the laws' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the growth of girls' and women's sports since Title IX was enacted 50 years ago is one of the \"successes in America,\" and he warned that allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's sports teams threatened to \"undermine or reverse\" that success. He said sports are typically a \"zero-sum game,\" and transgender athletes can displace girls and women if they are selected for a team or take their place on a podium.",
      "\"For the individual girl who does not make the team or doesn't get on the stand for the medal or doesn't make all-league, there's a harm there, and I think we can't sweep that aside,\" Kavanaugh said. He later sought to clarify that a ruling from the Supreme Court on Title IX grounds would be specific to sports and unlikely to open the door to policies that separate males and females in the classroom or other activities.",
      "Kavanaugh also said that when Congress enacted Title IX decades ago, it understood \"sex\" to mean biological sex at birth, and it would be up to lawmakers today to adjust the definition in the law.",
      "Some of the justices sought to test the lines of when it would be permissible under Title IX for girls and boys to be treated differently. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed the hypothetical scenario of boys having separate high school remedial programs, while Justices Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett raised examples of proficiency in chess or calculus.",
      "Barrett and Justice Clarence Thomas also questioned whether boys who are less athletically skilled than their male peers could try out for girls' teams if the laws were wiped away.",
      "But some of the liberal justices said that Pepper-Jackson and Hecox, as well as other transgender athletes like them, are seeking an exception to the state bans. Lawyers for the athletes told the court they received medical interventions that do not give them an unfair edge over girls and women competing against them.",
      "\"I would think the state would just have to make exceptions where people can demonstrate that the justification that makes the state's conduct constitutional doesn't apply to them,\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.",
      "Joshua Block, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued on behalf of Pepper-Jackson, told the justices that she and Hecox are categorically excluded from all sports, and said some states are using the definition of \"sex\" to deny athletic opportunity. He urged the Supreme Court not to issue a broad ruling, but to instead allow the district court to evaluate the facts and evidence related to athletic advantage.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",
      "Little v. Hecox",
      "Idaho was the first state in the nation to enact a law barring transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" Under the law, athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law and argued it is unconstitutional and a violation of Title IX. Hecox, who takes hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Madison Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, are defending the law. Kenyon and Marshall competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University and placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"If women don't have their own competitions, they won't be able to compete,\" Alan Hurst, Idaho's solicitor general, told the high court. \"Gender identity does not matter in sports, and that's why Idaho's law does not classify on the basis of gender identity. It treats all males equally and all females equally, regardless of identity.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye ruled in favor of Hecox in 2020, and blocked enforcement of the ban, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to the Idaho and West Virginia laws. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot. She decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "West Virginia v. B.P.J.",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted its ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" The law states that athletic teams or sports designated for females \"shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The debate over transgender athletes",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say, and they argue that neither she nor Hecox have any athletic advantage over their female competitors because they've received gender-transition treatments.",
      "But West Virginia officials argue that as a result of Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports, she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season.",
      "West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials warned that the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Maintaining separate boys and girls sports teams ensures that girls can safely and fairly compete in school sports. The question today is whether this enduring structure can continue,\" Williams told the justices. \"It can. Title IX permits sex-separated teams. It does so because biological sex matters in athletics in ways both obvious and undeniable.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Idaho officials assert that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say their law is motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes, because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and not eliminated by medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",
      "On the other side, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. But the legal teams for both transgender athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In Pepper-Jackson's challenge to West Virginia's law, her legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "The legal battles over the state bans for transgender athletes are the latest involving LGBTQ rights to land before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the court divided 6-3 in finding that protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII extend to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts joined Gorsuch and the three liberal justices in the majority, though he suggested when debating the sports-participation bans that the reasoning in that earlier case may not extend to these legal battles.",
      "\"The question here is whether or not a sex-based classification is necessarily a transgender classification,\" he said.",
      "In its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",
      "The Supreme Court has also allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily enforce policies banning transgender people from serving in the military and requiring passports to reflect the holder's biological sex at birth. Both cases landed before the high court in their early stages, and the Supreme Court has not yet been asked to decide the legal merits.",

    "summary": "President Trump defended his tariffs at a speech in Michigan, after he visited a factory in Dearborn.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump spoke Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club after he toured a Ford truck plant in nearby Dearborn. It comes as the president tries to focus on economic issues amid myriad international and domestic events that have gripped his administration since the start of the year.",
      "As Mr. Trump took to the stage, he touted the economy and also his victory in the 2024 election in Michigan. Mr. Trump called the event the \"easiest speech I've had to make\" because \"all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended his administration's tariffs, saying he had closed the trade deficit due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Tariff's my favorite word,\" Mr. Trump said, later amending that it's his \"fifth-favorite word.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said tariffs had helped the car industry in Michigan, a point he also made while in Dearborn.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be rolling out a plan to deal with affordability when he is at Davos, although he has said that affordability is a \"hoax.\"",
      "On the international front, Mr. Trump spoke about his administration's military strikes on Venezuela and capture of its former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He attacked the Democrats who voted to advance a war powers resolution, saying they \"hate our country,\" and he also called out a few of the Republicans who joined them.",
      "Mr. Trump met with oil executives to push for U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil industry, and he said Monday that \"we're working with the Venezuelan people and representatives, and it's amazing\" for the country's oil.",
      "Veering off topic from the economy, Mr. Trump said, starting Feb. 1, his administration would cut off all payments to sanctuary cities and \"states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens, and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come.\" Previous attempts to cut off funding from sanctuary cities have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized the fraud scandal in Minnesota involving dozens of Somali-American defendants, trashing Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, a staunch critic of Mr. Trump who represents Minneapolis and is Somali-American, saying she \"comes from a country with nothing and she comes here and she tells us about our Constitution.\"",
      "Walz last week dropped his reelection bid amid scrutiny over fraud in the state and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Trump said the recent immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which began shortly after a conservative YouTuber late last month published a video with\u00a0further allegations of fraud, has been successful in \"finding hundreds\" of criminals, and \"all we want to do is get them out.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get them out because they make it so impossible for you,\" he said. \"And you wonder, why? Why would they do that? You know, do they want to live with murderers, do they want to live with these people that are emptied out from prisons?\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention Renee Good, an American citizen who last week was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Mr. Trump and other high-ranking officials in his administration have repeatedly insisted the ICE officer was justified and that Good had instigated the shooting. Local officials and video footage of the incident have cast doubt on some of their claims.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona filed a civil lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay, which he claims amounts to unconstitutional retaliation against him.",
      "In a 46-page complaint, Kelly, a retired Navy captain, argued that he is the target of \"extreme rhetoric and punitive retribution\" by the Trump administration over a video in which he and other lawmakers urged members of the military to \"refuse illegal orders.\" Kelly asked a federal judge to set aside Hegseth's recent moves\u00a0and block the enforcement of any punishment against him.",
      "The Arizona Democratic senator alleged that he was punished for protected speech and said administration officials retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment. Kelly also argued that his criticisms of Hegseth are at the core of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which provides immunity to lawmakers from criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits that stem from legislative acts.",
      "\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" Kelly's legal team wrote in the complaint. \"Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.\"",
      "They said Kelly's public statements and legislative acts in response to the Trump administration's actions regarding the military are \"significant matters of public concern\" that fit within the First Amendment's protections and his oversight responsibilities as a senator. The senator's lawyers added that they believe there is no legal basis to take action against him based on \"post-retirement political speech.\"",
      "Kelly said in a statement that Hegseth's efforts to punish him leave military veterans at risk of seeing their rank and pay downgraded years after they retire for making comments that he or other defense secretaries dislike.",
      "\"His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn't like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted,\" Kelly said.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a Pentagon official said, \"We are aware of the litigation. However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"",
      "Hegseth, meanwhile, accused the senator of being \"worried and cranky.\"",
      "\"'Captain' Kelly knows exactly what he did, and that he will be held to account,\" he\u00a0wrote Tuesday on social media.",
      "Kelly and his colleagues came under fierce criticism by the Trump administration after they posted the video in November. The video was published amid the military buildup around Venezuela and strikes against alleged drug boats, and featured five other Democratic lawmakers who served in the U.S. military or in the intelligence community. They have not faced any adverse action from the Defense Department as they do not draw retirement pay from the U.S. military.",
      "President Trump and Hegseth lambasted the lawmakers for the comments, claiming that their statements amounted to \"sedition\" and \"treason.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed Kelly's statements \"undermined the chain of command\" and constituted \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" The Pentagon\u00a0announced it was conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Kelly to determine whether he should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.",
      "The Defense Department said in December it was \"escalating\" its review into a command investigation.",
      "Hegseth announced\u00a0last week that the Pentagon had \"initiated retirement grade determination proceedings\" that could result in a \"reduction in his retired grade\" and \"a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\" Hegseth also said he issued a formal letter to censure Kelly, citing his \"reckless misconduct.\"",
      "\"This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file,\" Hegseth added.",
      "Under federal law, retired U.S. military members can receive non-judicial punishments or even be charged, court-martialed and punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the system of rules and regulations established by Congress governing the military.",

      "Nearly one year after the mass pardon of more than 1,500 Trump-supporting Capitol riot defendants, members of a House committee are investigating whether any of the pardoned rioters are now working for President Trump's administration in the fast-growing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.",
      "In a three-page letter sent Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi and obtained by CBS News, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee has requested all \"records, documents, memos, and internal communications regarding the solicitation and hiring of anyone charged or investigated for actions in connection to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\"",
      "The committee's Democrats also said it remains unclear how many January 6 defendants \"have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security agents and officers.\"",
      "It's also not clear if ICE has hired any Jan. 6 defendants. But the agency is engaging in a rapid hiring spree, funded by a $75 billion funding boost passed by Congress last year that could allow ICE to add thousands of agents.",
      "And the Democrats' letter noted that other pardoned riot defendants or members of the crowd on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 have already joined the administration.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and the judiciary panel's ranking member, said it is possible riot defendants would go unrecognized while serving as immigration agents.",
      "\"Unique among all law enforcement agencies and all branches of the armed services, ICE agents conceal their identities, wearing masks and removing names from their uniforms,\" wrote Raskin, who previously served on the House's Jan. 6 select committee.",
      "Raskin's inquiry said, \"Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6th and were convicted of their offenses?\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin called the letter \"reckless, disgusting, and unhinged.\"",
      "\"ICE officers wear face coverings for one reason: to protect themselves and their families from real-world threats fueled by thug activist intimidation campaigns,\" McLaughlin said. \"Instead of condemning this violence and intimidation, Rep. Raskin is choosing to side with the mob, recycle false smears, and chase headlines.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters have triggered an outcry among victims of the Capitol insurrection and Democratic members of Congress, who argue Mr. Trump has incentivized violence in his name by giving clemency to supporters who committed violence.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended the pardons, claiming many of the defendants were \"absolutely innocent,\" were guilty of \"minor\" infractions or were given unfairly harsh sentences.",
      "In testimony at a congressional hearing last week, Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who also served on the House's Jan. 6 committee, said the mass clemency has emboldened the rioters.",
      "\"The greatest threat to democracy comes from those in positions of power who are willing to subvert the rule of law. That is exactly what this Administration is trying to engineer,\" he said.",
      "The inquiry into ICE hiring comes amid a roiling controversy over the deployment of federal agents into U.S. communities and confrontations between agents and protesters.",
      "Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who helped repel the rioting mob at the Capitol, told CBS News: \"Given the pardons and appointments of people into this administration, lawlessness is not frowned upon but rewarded.\"",
      "At least one Capitol riot defendant has secured a high-ranking post in the Justice Department: Jared Wise, who is serving as an agency adviser.",
      "Raskin's letter to the Justice Department alleged that Wise now has contributed to the administration's efforts \"to fire, demote, and harass the dedicated career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support personnel who did their professional and civic duty holding to account the persons who committed crimes on January 6th.\"",
      "Wise, a former FBI employee, was pardoned on charges of civil disorder and assaulting or resisting law enforcement. The Justice Department alleged in 2023 that Wise told D.C. police officers, \"You guys are disgusting. I'm former\u2014I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it.\"",
      "Wise's trial was underway when Mr. Trump issued the January 20, 2025 pardons. His case was dismissed hours later.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, will file a motion to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit brought by President Trump over a 2024 documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech together, according to a document filed with the court on Monday. The BBC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Mr. Trump's attorneys are wrong to claim he suffered damages due to the documentary.",
      "The suit, filed last month by Mr. Trump's legal team in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team is seeking $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion, court filings reviewed by CBS News show.",
      "The 33-page complaint filed by Mr. Trump's attorneys in December accuses the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a documentary for the BBC's \"Panorama\" program, which was broadcast in the U.K. a week before the 2024 U.S. election.",
      "One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in the same address. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "In the latest court documents released Monday, the BBC's legal team said it will argue that the Florida court should dismiss the suit because the \"defamation case arises out of a documentary that Defendants the British Broadcasting Corporation (\"the BBC\"), BBC Studios Distribution Ltd., and BBC Studios Productions Ltd. did not create in Florida, produce in Florida, or air in Florida.\"",
      "Attorneys for the BBC will also argue that the case did not cause damage to or defame Mr. Trump, noting the fact that he was re-elected after the documentary was broadcast in Britain, and that Mr. Trump won the state of Florida decisively.",
      "The BBC's legal team also argues that a claim made in Mr. Trump's suit, alleging that the documentary was made available in the U.S. via a streaming service, is inaccurate.",
      "\"Plaintiff alleges that the Documentary was available in the U.S. on the streaming service BritBox. But simply clicking on the link that Plaintiff cites for this point shows it is not on BritBox. Nor was it ever available on BritBox,\" according to the filing submitted by law firm Ballard Spahr, which is representing the BBC.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team has not provided evidence that the documentary was created \"with actual malice,\" Ballard Spahr said Monday.",

No amount of attempted legal maneuvers can change that fact. President Trump will continue to hold accountable the BBC and all those who traffic in fake news.\"",
      "The BBC formally apologized to Mr. Trump in November, saying in a statement that the edited soundbite in the Panorama documentary had given, \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams violate the Constitution and Title IX.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to consider whether states can forbid transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams, stepping into a high-stakes fight that has been simmering for years.",
      "Twenty-seven states have enacted laws that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Trump signed an executive order in February that directed his administration to strip federal funding from programs that allow transgender girls and women to compete on athletic teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of that directive, the NCAA updated its participation policy for transgender student-athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to only athletes assigned female at birth. Then, last July, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee effectively barred transgender women from competing on women's teams.",
      "The Supreme Court is now poised to wade into the debate over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports when it convenes Tuesday to hear arguments in two cases involving restrictions from Idaho and West Virginia. The justices are confronted with whether the measures violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark 50-year-old law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.",
      "Two transgender athletes who challenged their states' laws, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson, argue the bans discriminate against them on the basis of sex and transgender status. The laws, they say, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, since they're barred from joining the teams that match their gender identity and cannot compete on boys' or men's teams because it would be inconsistent with their gender identity.",
      "\"I play for my school for the same reason other kids on my track team do \u2014 to make friends, have fun, and challenge myself through practice and teamwork,\" Pepper-Jackson said in a video statement. \"And all I've ever wanted was the same opportunities as my peers.\"",
      "But the states argue that their laws do not discriminate based on transgender status, and instead draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. West Virginia and Idaho officials say their bans' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "\"Every time a male athlete runs as a female, a roster spot is lost to a female. It means it's given to a male. And that's unfair,\" Madison Kenyon, who ran collegiate track and cross-country and competed against a transgender woman, told CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford.",
      "Kenyon continued: \"Those opportunities to compete, to have a scholarship, to gain an education for women, were almost unheard of 50 years ago. Title IX was created to give women equal opportunity, equal spots in sports as men. And when men compete as women, it defeats the purpose of that. It gets rid of our equal opportunity and takes away our ability to get a scholarship and to compete and to get an education. And I experienced that.\"",
      "Idaho's first-in-the-nation law",
      "Idaho was the first state to enact a law banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law. She argued the measure was unconstitutional and violated Title IX. Hecox, who receives hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Defending the law are Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, who competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University. They\u00a0placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"Stepping on the line, standing next to a male when we're about to race \u2014 it's unfair,\" Marshall told Crawford. \"I don't know how much \u2014 they don't have to put in as much work as I do because of the clear advantages that they have.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye blocked enforcement of the ban in 2020, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to Idaho's law, as well as West Virginia's. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot.",
      "Citing \"significant challenges that have affected her both personally and academically,\" as well as \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters\" because of the lawsuit, Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing that she decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to discuss at oral arguments whether to dismiss her case.",
      "West Virginia's law",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted the state's ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that \"athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The legal battle over transgender athletes",
      "Schools have had sex-separated school sports teams for decades, but Republican-led states began enacting their recent restrictions as a growing number of instances of transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sporting events came to light.",
      "One openly transgender U.S. athlete competed at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz, who uses they/them pronouns and was assigned female at birth. NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate panel in December 2024 that he was aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes who were among the 510,000 student-athletes governed by the association.",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say.",
      "But dozens of female athletes competing at the high school and collegiate level told the Supreme Court in filings about their experiences competing against transgender athletes on basketball and volleyball courts, at track meets and in swimming pools.",
      "\"There's quite an unfair advantage that males have on females. And when they compete against women, it ruins the integrity of our sports,\" Kenyon said. \"Running is a mental sport. And when you step on the line and you're racing a male athlete, the race hasn't even started, but it feels like the outcome has already been decided.\"",
      "And Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports in West Virginia has had reverberations, state officials say. They estimate that she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season, and she placed third in discus and eighth in shot put at a May state championship meet.",
      "\"In an athletic regime where women are supposed to have the ability to compete fairly against other females, when you put a male in that mix, it's not fair,\" said Jonathan Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative judicial group that is co-counsel to the states. \"That's why we have girls' sports. And you can't erase those physical differences, even with puberty blockers.\"",
      "In defending the bans, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Idaho officials argue in filings that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say the sports-participation laws are motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "\"While these cases are simply about upholding these 27 state laws, it's really about restoring common sense, fairness and safety in sports and beyond based on biological reality,\" Bursch told CBS News.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials said the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Sex affects athletic performance; gender identity does not,\" West Virginia lawyers wrote. \"If the court below were right, then Title IX's role in preserving girls' sports opportunities would end.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. Lawyers for the two athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics. Hecox and Pepper-Jackson have no athletic advantage over competitors because of the medical treatments they've received, they say.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In West Virginia's case, Pepper-Jackson's legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "\"The question before the court is straightforward: Does the law permit West Virginia to categorically exclude transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity? And the answer is no,\" Sasha Buchert, director of the Transgender & Nonbinary Rights Project at Lambda Legal, told reporters. \"These young people deserve the same opportunities, the same dignity and the same chance to grow through sports that we afford to all students.\"",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and are not eliminated by medical interventions like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",
      "Transgender rights at the Supreme Court",
      "The pair of disputes over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports are the latest involving LGBTQ rights that have landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the justices divided 6-3 to expand protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the court's reasoning in that case should extend to Title IX, which uses similar language.",
      "\"Just as discriminating against a transgender person in employment is sex discrimination under Title VII, it's also sex discrimination under Title IX, and when Becky is prevented from being on teams with other girls like her, she is subjected to discrimination that effectively excludes her from participating in the school's educational programs,\" Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project, told reporters. Block will be arguing on behalf of Pepper-Jackson before the Supreme Court.",
      "But Bursch, of the Alliance Defending Freedom, said that under Title VII, sex isn't supposed to be a factor in whether a person is hired, fired, promoted or disciplined. In the context of Title IX, though, sex has to be considered, otherwise there wouldn't be male and female sports teams, he said.",
      "\"When you're talking about a statute that requires consideration of sex, then all of a sudden, sex discrimination means something very different than it does in Title VII,\" he said. \"And if the court were to adopt the Bostock reasoning in Title IX, it would completely destroy male and female sports teams.\"",
      "Most recently, in its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",
      "The Supreme Court has also allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily enforce policies banning transgender people from serving in the military and requiring passports to reflect the holder's biological sex at birth. Both cases landed before the high court in their early stages, and the Supreme Court has not yet been asked to decide the legal merits.",
      "Supreme Court seems likely to uphold state transgender athlete bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court says Trump can't deploy National Guard to Chicago for now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court weighs campaign finance limits in GOP-backed challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court seems open to allowing Trump to fire some officials without cause\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to hear major test of presidential power in case over FTC firing",

    "story": [

      "\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will start using Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok. The word comes days after Grok drew global outcry for generating highly sexualized deepfake images.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tina-peters-jared-polis-clemency-decision-cbs-evening-news/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:23:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Gov. Polis said he will make a clemency decision based on the facts of Tina Peters' election interference case, \"and there's some that work in her favor, some that work against her.\"",
    "story": [
      "During his last year in office, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis will make his final decisions on which prisoners in the state he will grant clemency. Among those under consideration is\u00a0Tina Peters, who was convicted of multiple felonies stemming from unauthorized accessing of voting machines, and who President Trump has repeatedly demanded be set free.",
      "Peters, a former county clerk of Mesa County in western Colorado and former candidate for Colorado secretary of state, was sentenced in October 2024 to nine years in prison after being convicted on seven of 10 state charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation.",
      "Polis previously refused to move Peters to federal custody, but has also said recently that he would be looking into her case in his final year. Mr. Trump said in December he was granting a pardon to Peters, even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes, and she was charged in state court.",
      "\"You can't give the president the headspace on this,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"You look at every case on clemency on the merits. You have somebody who is nonviolent, a first-time offender, elderly. On the other hand, does she take full accountability for her crime? We don't look at this in isolation.\"",
      "Peters insisted, even during her sentencing, that she did nothing wrong and was trying to prevent and discover voter fraud. There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, contrary to Mr. Trump's repeated claims.",
      "\"I have dozens of these requests that we look at regularly, and I want to make sure that we don't look at this one in any different way,\" Polis said, but noted he has not made a decision.",
      "Polis said he will only make his decision based on the facts of the case, \"and there's some that work in her favor, some that work against her.\"",
      "Polis said he has a harder time with cases where people have committed violent crimes.",
      "\"To let somebody out at some point \u2014 have they made restitution? \u2014 is a tough decision, but it's one that I'm never afraid to shy away from,\" he said.",

    "summary": "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights,\" Polis said. \"When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere.\"",
    "story": [
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat finishing out his final term who has at times found himself at odds with his party on key national issues, says the best way to understand his politics is that he is \"pro-freedom.\"",
      "That extends to more benign issues like allowing kids to operate lemonade stands without a permit, to larger concerns like legalizing so-called \"magic mushrooms,\"\u00a0which Polis supported, and vaccine mandates, which Polis opposes.",
      "\"I'm pro-vax, me and my family are vaxxed,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"I don't think the government should force you to get vaxxed. ... So, pro-freedom.\"",
      "Asked Monday about the recent changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance on childhood vaccines, recommending fewer immunizations than were previously suggested, Polis said, \"Those are recommendations, obviously.\"",
      "\"We [Colorado] use some of the national recommendations, that, you know, again, it's up to each parent to make that decision for their kids,\" Polis said. \"It's good to put the best possible information in front of people. In most cases, getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your health and your kid's health.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has called the CDC's changes dangerous and said it would continue giving its own guidance.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back voters who chose to support President Trump because of his campaign promises to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a major role in his administration, Polis told CBS News, \"I think Democrats should be the party of health.\"",
      "He said a main component of that is making health care more affordable, but he lamented that Democrats have not been as vocal about issues like \"the dangers of highly processed foods,\" healthy school meals, and insecticides, as some Republicans have been.",
      "\"Remember, it's nobody's goal to have to have health care. It's your goal to just stay healthy, and a lot of that comes down to diet, nutrition and exercise,\" Polis said. \"And it shouldn't he a partisan message. Colorado has the lowest obesity rate of any state. We're proud of that. We have a great outdoor lifestyle. That's something that we should really take across the country.\"",
      "Asked how far his \"pro-freedom\" stance goes, Polis said, \"I'm not an anarchist.\"",
      "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights. ... When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere,\" he said. \"When you start interfering with your neighbors and those around you, there's a very appropriate role of government to step in and say, 'They deserve their freedom too.'\"",
      "Polis' interview comes amid the Trump administration's attempts to deny Colorado and some other Democratic-led states billions of dollars in social service funding over allegations of fraud \u2014 allegations that have, in part, led to the surge of federal agents in Minneapolis, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last week.",
      "\"We welcome any way to look at fraud and defeat it. I mean, we see the federal government as a partner in that,\" Polis said. \"Freezing it [the funding] before they found any fraud, that's really inappropriate.\"",
      "\"We have one of the lower fraud rates of any state,\" Polis said. \"Every state's going to have some misuse of funds. We have one of the lower ones.\"",
      "Polis said that, during his time in office, national politics have become \"more vitriolic.\"",
      "\"To step down to the level of personal attacks and undermine the motives of others is really what's dangerous in today's society,\" he said. \"What bothers me the most is the huge gap in perceptions of what Democrats think Republicans believe and what Republicans think Democrats believe. Most Americans are good, honest, hardworking Americans who want to make their country a better place. And we need to celebrate that commonality.\"",
      "Polis said he believes the two parties often work better at the state level than at the national level, and noted that about half of all Coloradans don't even belong to a political party. He touted the success of direct democracy, such as ballot initiatives that led to the legalization of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms in the state, as well as measures such as ranked choice voting, which Denver and Boulder both use for their mayoral elections.",
      "\"I think a multi-party system would be healthier in many ways,\" he said of America's de facto two-party political system.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is expected to testify publicly in front of the House Judiciary Committee later this month.",
      "GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's chairman, announced on X Monday that Smith it set to testify on Jan. 22.",
      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Jordan initially\u00a0told Politico\u00a0on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",
      "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of Smith's public testimony.",
      "\"After Republicans forced Jack Smith into a backroom interrogation and rejected our calls for an open public hearing, now they decide they want a public hearing with Jack Smith after all,\" Raskin said in a statement last week. \"Their backroom strategy backfired in historic fashion.\"",
      "He added: \"This upcoming hearing is a win for truth-seeking Americans and yet another looming humiliation for Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, who depend on a daily diet of lies to keep their Administration afloat.\"",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Jordan, the House panel's chairman, issued a subpoena for Smith's initial testimony to be private.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Trump don't agree on much, but Warren suggests they might be able to work together on capping credit card interest rates and potentially addressing other cost-of-living issues.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to cap credit card rates, something that Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, has long supported. Late Friday, Mr. Trump proposed capping rates at 10% for one year. After Warren delivered a speech Monday morning criticizing Mr. Trump's record on affordability issues and saying he should pick up the phone to do something about capping credit card interest, Warren said the president called her.",
      "\"After my speech, the president called me, and I delivered this same message on affordability to him directly,\" Warren said in a statement. \"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"",
      "Speaking to CBS News Monday afternoon, Warren noted that she has long supported such a plan.",
      "\"I had said at the time when he announced this a year ago, I said, great \u2014 I had been proposing that for years. Let's do it! And what's Donald Trump done since then? Nothing,\" she said.",
      "Warren said she and the president also discussed housing costs.",
      "\"While I had a chance to talk to him, I raised the question of how we reduce housing costs. We've got a bill that has passed the Senate unanimously to expand the supply of housing, but Republicans over in the House have hung it up.

      "Banks and other credit card issuers are strongly opposed to the idea, arguing a limit on interest rates could force banks to cut off access for millions of people, especially higher-risk borrowers.

    "summary": "Video from the scene, along with statements from witnesses and local officials, disputes the accounts of federal officials regarding the circumstances that led up to the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.",
      "The shooting comes as the Trump administration\u00a0has deployed\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the\u00a0state's fraud scandal\u00a0and immigration.",
      "Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.",
      "Woman who was shot, Renee Nicole Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen",
      "The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.",
      "Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.",
      "The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her wife and 6-year-old son.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Ganger, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.",
      "He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.",
      "CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.",
      "Feds say she was shot during \"targeted operations\" by ICE",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting \"targeted operations.\"",
      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",
      "Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents \"stay out of our schools.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

      "\"This is the International Space Station. We've had continuous human habitation for 25 years. It's a wonder of engineering, a wonder of science and a wonder of diplomacy. We're from all over the planet, and we're working together. It's a great symbol of what human beings can do.\"",
      "Fincke thanked each crewmate for their performance during the shortened mission, telling Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, \"you are a rock star, superstar, awesome star.\"",
      "\"It's been a pleasure serving with you, watching you see Earth for the first time, riding on the rocket, and now it's coming to an end where we get to go home,\" he said. \"It's bittersweet.\"",
      "All four Crew 11 fliers looked healthy and in good spirits on a  space-to-ground television broadcast of the change of command ceremony with no indication of which astronaut may have experienced the undisclosed medical issue that triggered Crew 11's early departure.",
      "Fincke then presented Kud-Sverchkov with a symbolic key to the space station.",

      "The photo, Fincke added, \"was taken as we prepared our space suits for return - a normal, methodical step in getting ready to come home, and a reminder that this decision was made calmly and carefully, with people at the center.\"",
      "Crew 11's early return marks the first time in NASA history that a crew has been told to cut its mission short because of a medical issue.",
      "James Polk, NASA's chief medical officer, said Friday that according to statistical analyses, \"we should have had a medical evacuation approximately every three years ... and we've not one to date.\"",
      "\"Even in this case, we're erring on the side of caution,\" he said. \"Again, it's not an emergent evacuation, but we are erring on the side of caution for the crew member and in their best interest.\"",
      "Fincke plans to turn over command of the station to cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov during a brief ceremony Monday afternoon.",
      "\"What stands out most to me is how clearly NASA cares about its people,\" Fincke wrote. \"Flight surgeons, engineers, managers and support teams came together quickly and professionally to chart the best path forward.",
      "\"The ground teams - across mission control centers and partner organizations around the world - have been extraordinary. We're proud of the joint work we've done and the camaraderie we've shared, including some great songs and more than a few dad jokes.\"",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Kud-Sverchkov and his Soyuz MS-28 crewmates \u2014 Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams \u2014 will have the station to themselves until Crew 11's replacements arrive.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev remain officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. But NASA is working to move that target up a few days if possible.",
      "\"We're leaving the ISS in great hands,\" Fincke said. \"The three crewmates who arrived in November will continue the mission, and they'll be joined by Crew-12 in just a few weeks.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

      "Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Musk's children, is one of the alleged victims. She said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Tuesday that Grok allowed users to generate and publish sexual deepfake images of her to X without permission, including manipulating photos of her as a minor.",
      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",
      "The mother of two, who has a 1-year-old son with Musk, said she asked Grok to take the photos down.",
      "\"Grok said, 'I confirm that you don't consent. I will no longer produce these images.' And then it continued to produce more and more images, and more and more explicit images,\" she said.",
      "St. Clair said she filed a report directly with Musk's company xAI, which operates Grok. Some of the images were then removed.",
      "\"This can be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" St. Clair said.",
      "St. Clair said her issue is with the Chatbot, not Musk \u2013 who recently said he plans to file for sole custody of their child over allegations that St. Clair \"might\" transition their son. A source close to St. Clair said that is \"absurd and unequivocally false.\"",
      "\"If they want to say my bone to pick is \u2026 the chatbot undressing minors and myself and stripping me nude, yes. You're right. I have a bone to pick with that and I don't care who's doing it. So Elon's not special about me speaking out on this,\" St. Clair said.",
      "CBS News reached out to Musk and has not received a response yet. Earlier this month, xAI said it \"takes action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "\"Make it stop\"",
      "A recent study by AI Forensics, a nonprofit that investigates the algorithms of major platforms, found 53% of the Grok images they reviewed contained individuals in minimal attire, with 81% of them being women.",
      "St. Clair said she wants the U.S. government to solve the issue and \"make it stop.\"",
      "\"The need to regulate it,\" she said. \"AI should not be allowed to generate and undress children and women. That's what needs to happen.\"",
      "She believes the key is enforcing already existing laws, saying, \"who's ever responsible for enforcing them. Not me.\"",
      "St. Clair said her ability to earn money on X has been revoked since she has spoken out and when asked if she plans to take legal action, she said she's \"considering all options available.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:12:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will start using Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok. The word comes days after Grok drew global outcry for generating highly sexualized deepfake images.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "summary": "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as its new president and vice chairman.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.",
      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Mr. Trump's orbit.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:04:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge David Novak had given Lindsey Halligan a week to explain why she is using the title of U.S. attorney after another federal judge found her appointment to the position invalid.",
    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department officials defended Lindsey Halligan's attempts to remain in her position as a U.S. attorney in court filings Tuesday, responding to a federal judge who demanded to know why she was continuing to do so after another judge had found that her appointment was invalid.",
      "The filing, signed by Halligan, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, accused a Trump-appointed judge of \"gross abuse of power,\" and attempting to \"coerce the Executive Branch into conformity.\"",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits on the federal bench in Richmond, ordered Halligan to provide the basis for her repeated use of the title of U.S. attorney and explain why it \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\"",
      "Novak\u00a0gave Halligan\u00a0seven days to respond to his order and brief on why he \"should not strike Ms. Halligan's identification as United States attorney\" after she listed herself on an indictment returned in the Eastern District of Virginia in December as a \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie had ruled in November that Halligan's\u00a0appointment as interim U.S. attorney\u00a0was invalid and violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, and she dismissed the cases Halligan had brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. After that, the interim U.S. attorney may be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "Currie found that the 120-day clock began when Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert was initially appointed in January 2025. Currie concluded that when that timeframe expired, Bondi's authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney expired along with it.",
      "The judge ruled that Halligan had been serving unlawfully since Sept. 22 and concluded that \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment\" had to be set aside. That included the Comey and James indictments.",
      "In their response, Bondi, Blanche and Halligan called Novak's move an \"inquisition,\" \"insult,\" and a \"cudgel\" against the executive branch. The Justice Department argued that Currie's ruling in November applied only to the Comey and James cases and did not bar Halligan from calling herself U.S. attorney in other cases that she oversees.",
      "\"Adding insult to error, [Novak's order] posits that the United States' continued assertion of its legal position that Ms. Halligan properly serves as the United States Attorney amounts to a factual misrepresentation that could trigger attorney discipline. The Court's thinly veiled threat to use attorney discipline to cudgel the Executive Branch into conforming its legal position in all criminal prosecutions to the views of a single district judge is a gross abuse of power and an affront to the separation of powers,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "In his earlier order, Novak said that Currie's decision \"remains binding precedent in this district and is not subject to being ignored.\"",
      "The Justice Department called Currie's ruling \"erroneous\": and said that Halligan is entitled to maintain her position \"notwithstanding a single district judge's contrary view.\"",
      "On Monday, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Robert McBride, was fired after he refused to help lead the\u00a0Justice Department's prosecution\u00a0of Comey, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News. McBride is a former longtime federal prosecutor in Kentucky's Eastern District and had only been on the job as first assistant U.S. attorney for a few months after joining the office in the fall.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team, and joined Mr. Trump's White House staff after he won a second term in 2024. In September, Halligan was selected to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after her predecessor abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Just days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and pursued several arguments to have their respective indictments dismissed, including the validity of Halligan's appointment, and claims of vindictive prosecution.",

      "A Department of Homeland Security official said the Trump administration had decided to terminate Somalia's Temporary Protected Status program, which allows beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation.",
      "Nationals of Somalia enrolled in the TPS program are now set to lose their legal status and work permits on March 17. The DHS official said roughly 2,500 Somali immigrants with TPS or pending applications are expected to be affected by the termination. A notice by the federal government said 1,082 Somalis were enrolled in TPS as of Dec. 8 and another 1,383 had applied for the program.",
      "The Trump administration has urged TPS holders whose status will lapse to self-deport, warning that they will be found, arrested and deported if they fail to do so.",
      "\"Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. \"Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.\"",
      "The move had been previewed last year by Mr. Trump, who has focused intensely on members of the Somali community, often describing them in derogatory terms. In a Cabinet meeting in December, Mr. Trump referred to people from Somalia as \"garbage,\" claiming they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",

      "But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature. It has also argued conditions in some of the affected countries have improved or that it's not in the national interest to renew protections for their nationals, criticizing TPS as a magnet for illegal immigration.",

    "summary": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration's tariffs caused a \"few-billion-dollar impact,\" but also praised them for \"leveling the playing field.\"",
    "story": [
      "As General Motors settles into its new Detroit headquarters, the automotive industry is facing challenging times as it contends with rising costs, shifting tariff policies and a fledgling electric vehicle market. GM CEO Mary Barra tells CBS News that, despite those challenges, \"I think we're on a good path\" and she is optimistic about the future of her company and the U.S. economy.",
      "The market for electric vehicles hasn't quite taken off in the U.S. just yet. Barra told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil Tuesday that GM is \"still committed\" to EVs, but thinks a major issue is that the industry was \"getting a little ahead of the consumer.\"",
      "\"A vehicle is such a big purchase for a consumer,\" she said. \"For many of them, it's the most expensive thing that they buy.\"",
      "\"I think we're on a good path. I think as there's more charging infrastructure, as we continue to get the cost of batteries down, I think consumers will pick an electric vehicle, because they're better,\" Barra predicted.",
      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-today-inflation-december-2025-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:23:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

    "story": [
      "Timothy Busfield turned himself into police on Tuesday after authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant for the director and Emmy Award-winning actor accused of child sex abuse.",
      "A spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department confirmed to CBS News that Busfield had surrendered. He was booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Bernalillo County   on a child sex abuse charge. The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge was for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department on Friday filed a criminal complaint that alleged a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "In a video provided to TMZ, Busfield said the allegations \"are all lies.\"",
      "\"I did not do anything to those little boys,\" the 68-year-old actor said in the video appearing to show him in Albuquerque. He said he arrived in the city after driving 2,000 miles.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, Busfield's attorney, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said his client \"is innocent and is determined to clear his name,\" adding that \"the claims\" against Busfield are \"completely false.\"",
      "The criminal complaint states the boy reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him three or four times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him, the complaint said.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "When interviewed by authorities, Busfield suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. He also said he likely would have picked up and tickled the boys, saying the set was a playful environment.",
      "The mother of the twins \u2014 who are identified only by their initials in court records \u2014 reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It was produced by Warner Bros., which, according to the complaint, conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991. He is married to actor\u00a0Melissa Gilbert, who deactivated her Instagram account amid the allegations.",
      "Gilbert indicated through a publicist that she won't speak publicly at the request of attorneys for Busfield while the legal process unfolds.",
      "\"Her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.\"",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, one of the boys has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Tony.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --I actually want to start overseas with Iran. Americans woke up this morning, and they saw that you said, \"Help is on the way.\"",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: What do you mean by that?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lot of help on the way and in different forms, including economic help from our standpoint, and we're not gonna help Iran very much. And, you know, we put Iran out of business with their nuclear capacity, and now, depending on what's actually happening--nobody's been able to give us accurate numbers about how many people they've killed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, on that point, Mr. President.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it looks like it could be a pretty substantial number, and that's gonna be a lot of problems for them.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: A lot of problems. On that point, you-- you did say the U.S. would get involved if Iran started killing protesters--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: They have.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: By the many thousands, according to reports.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we'll see what that is. I've heard two numbers, but we'll see what that is.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, now we're hearing that they're gonna start hanging protesters tomorrow, so it comes back to the question, have they crossed your red line, or has the line moved?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I haven't heard about the hanging. If they hang 'em, you're gonna see some things that-- I don't know what you're-- where you come from and what your thought process is, but you'll perhaps be very happy.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: What do you mean by that?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will take very strong action. If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: And this strong action you're talking about, what's the endgame?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The endgame is to win. I like winning. And we're winning.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: How do you define that in Iran?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with Soleimani, and let's define it in Iran, where- wiped out the Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration, as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it and they said, you know, Trump was right. So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people. And now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that works out for them. It's not going to work out good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: There's so much going on overseas. Understandably, a lot of your focus has been on other countries. But when I talk to Americans, when I talk to your own voters, they want your focus to be on them, and they feel like it may be drifting. What do you have to say to them?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Tony, we have the strongest economy maybe in the history of our country. If you went around this plant, like I have, they just announced they're going to 24 hours. This is a Ford plant, but GM's the same, Stellantis is the same. They're going 24 hours all around the clock. They're enlarging every plant in this country. We're building more plants in the country than we've ever built. There's no inflation. You saw the inflation numbers have-- inflation's very low.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It seemed bad on groceries--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. Our growth numbers are through the roof. Our job numbers are tremendous. We have the highest stock market we've ever had. Today we hit-- every day for the last, I think, 48 times out of 11 months, 48 days out of 11 months, we've had the number one stock market in the history of our country. So my big focus is here. But you-- you can't be forgetting about bad threats. You can't be forgetting about an Iran with a nuclear weapon. You can't forget that there's tremendous wealth in the Middle East, and a lot of that wealth is coming over here to build plants. Saudi Arabia's giving us $2 trillion. Qatar is giving us $2 trillion. UAE is giving us $2 trillion. All of that is for the good of this country. So my focus is very much on this country, and-- but you can't lose sight of the fact that we need peace all over the world.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've ended eight wars. If we had those eight wars raging, it would be very bad for this country.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, you mentioned the market there. I've got a question that might affect the markets. It's the Jerome Powell situation. He's the Fed chair. I know you've said you had nothing to do with the investigation, the criminal probe into him. But you have been criticizing him for mo--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, he's terrible. No, I think he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --for most of the last year. And-- and even some prominent conservatives say it-- it looks like political retribution.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And some prominent conservatives also love it, so, you know, you gotta mention them too--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, what do you say to that accusation?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As you grow older in this position, you have to mention the other side. More people like it than not. He's been a lousy Fed chairman. He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes. He's been too high on interest rates, and I call him 'too late.' He's too late to reduce. He should have reduced 'em by more. Despite that, we fought through that. In addition, he heads up a construction situation on a rebuilding of a little building, two little buildings in-- called the Fed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know where they are. You've seen 'em a million times--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I could have done that job. I could have fixed 'em up for $25 million. He's into billions and billions of dollars, and it looks like they won't open for a long time. And he's either corrupt or incompetent.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: So on the question of corrupt or incompetent - you're right, some prominent conservatives are criticizing this. I'll take your word that others are not.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't have to take my word. What you should do is go out and interview some people, and you'll find out.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: But on this direct question about political retribution, what it looks like, sir, what's your response?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't help what it looks like. Look, I've created the greatest economy maybe in history, and you're seeing that now. Plants are being built all over the country. We've never had anything like it. They're leaving Canada, they're leaving Mexico, they're leaving Japan and all over Europe, Germany, all over Europe. They're coming in. Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah I just saw him.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He just told me that he's never seen anything like what's happened. I also freed up some of the environmental nonsense which made it impo-- virtually impossible to build a car and certainly to build a car for the right cost.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they're doing better than they've ever done. AI, we're leading China by a lot. We're leading China by a tremendous amount. We're leading everybody at everything. And then we had a big victory. I would say that even you would say that. We had a big victory with Venezuela. We had a big victory with Iran. We have a lot of victories. We don't have any defeats, and I want to keep it that way.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I've got an important question about the situation in Minnesota. The death of Renee Nicole Good. I've been speaking to her father, who is a big supporter of yours--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --like many Americans are. But he's heartbroken right now.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can understand that, yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's heartbroken because his daughter is dead, that's obvious.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she's a domestic terrorist. What do you wanna say to her father right now?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I wanna say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side. As you say, he might be on my side, he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He is on your side.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think that's great. And-- and I do, I think it's great. And I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But, you know, her actions were pretty tough. And I've seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms. But the bottom line is, look, we have hundreds of thousands of murderers in our countries, killers. ICE is trying to get them out. They were let in through an open border policy of sleepy Joe Biden. ICE is working very hard to get them out. Their job is being made very, very difficult. And, you know, when you look at that tape, it-- it can be viewed two ways, I guess. But when you look at the way that was-- that car was pulled away-- there were a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I wanna talk about the economy while we have you here. The inflation numbers came out. Overall not bad, but grocery prices--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, overall very good. Good for us, good for our country. Joe Biden had the highest inflation numbers in history, correct?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: The direction--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have 'em down to a level that they haven't seen in about nine years.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Then Mr. President, help me understand. When I travel the country, and I go all over the place, and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don't feel it, because grocery prices are up-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they might not, but they're going to now. I've only been here for 11 months, okay? And, you know, the first few months were really rough if you look at 'em, because I inherited a mess. I inherited a mess of crime. I inherited a mess of inflation. I inherited a mess of places closing up and going to other countries. And now we have the hottest country in the world. Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Might be what?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's how bad- might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, I'm just trying to be fair here, I'm just trying to do my job, and I wanna talk about this assembly line here. (UNINTEL)--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To me it's vibrant. Listen to the sound.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It's incredible, right?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I love the sound of an assembly line.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It's incredible. But they've got one not far from here, they just idled the electric vehicle plant.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I'm-- you-- you didn't give me a chance. I'm coming there--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --I'm coming around.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I agree. I said, \"I want electric, and I want gasoline, and I want hybrids, I want everything.\" But you were gonna be forced under the mandate to buy an electric car in a very short period of time. I didn't want that. And I ended that. Now people can have electric. They can have gasoline. They can have hybrid.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: But are they gonna have people to build these cars? The CEO of Ford--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --said not long ago he's got 5,000 open mechanic jobs. He can't find people willing and able--",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --to fill them. What's going on?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --thing, Tony. That means it's vibrant. You could also have things where you have so many people and they can't get jobs. It's true, we are doing so well. It's hard. Now, what's gonna happen is people are being trained rapidly, and you're gonna have a thing called robots. And robots are gonna be a big factor. I predict--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah, let's talk about that.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that robots are gonna be a big factor in the future, and it's gonna help out. But you have--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, I--I-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you have a situation now where our economy is doing so well that it's not that easy to get people. We're training people. They're training people. Companies are training people. And they're doing well.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Why do you think--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, that's a positive question you asked me. I don't think you asked it in that way, but we are doing so well right now that we're training people to take those jobs. One other thing, we terminated many federal jobs. Those federal-- because that's a good thing. Because they wanna go private. The way you make our country great is you can't have too many federal workers, all right? Those workers are being trained to go into the private sector at a much higher salary.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Let's talk about robotics for a second, because that's a concern of a lotta people working.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not only here, but all over the country. What is the future for jobs like these? One guy told me on the way in, he thinks it's a critical threat to his industry.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, in one light you're telling me that, you know, you can't get workers.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, that's what the CEO said.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm-- well, you said that. And then you said the opposite in front of me. You can't have it both ways. Look, we're gonna need help, because we're expanding so rapidly that we need-- people are gonna make a lotta money. A skilled worker, a person with talent, education in what they do, not education in nuclear physics, education in what they do, they're gonna make a lotta money. Federal workers, they're leaving the federal government where you had ten people for every job. And they're going out and they're going into the private sector at two and three times the salary. And you see that all over. So I only say this: I think that robotics are gonna be great because this country won't have enough people if we don't have it.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our people are gonna be trained and they're gonna make more money than they've ever made before.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question, I think you'll be in- I was very interested in a comment you made recently about nothing being able to limit your action overseas except for your own morality and your own mind. I'd like to take that same question and apply it here in the U.S. Is there anything that limits your power, your movement, your action here other than your own morality?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I talk about morality. I'm a moral person. I don't like seeing death. I don't like seeing our people hurt. I don't like seeing the other side hurt either. You know, when we went into Venezuela we lost nobody, but a lot of people on the other side were-- were killed. I don't like that. Somebody else would say, \"Oh, that's wonderful.\" I don't like that. So yeah, it's limited by my morality. And I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it's limited.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not the Constitution, not the courts? That's what I thought you were gonna say.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the Constitution of course. That goes without saying. But you're asking me what really can stop-- we'll never get to the courts, we'll never get to the Constitution, because I don't-- I wanna see what's good for our country. And you know what? The courts wanna see that too.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Mr. President, thank you very much.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, but at a lesser salary. Thank you very much.",

      "The costs of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building have swelled to $2.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion.

    "story": [
      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's office \u2014 including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson \u2014 have resigned as the office continues to face pressure to treat the investigation of the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE officer as an assault on a federal officer case.",
      "Thompson also previously served as the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota; he was appointed by President Trump in June and served in the position until October. He resigned from the attorney's office along with Harry Jacobs, Melinda Williams, Thomas Calhoun-Lopez, Ruth Schneider and Tom Hollenhurst.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News the resignations stemmed from concern over a request to probe Good's widow \u2014 who was with her when they encountered the ICE agents \u2014 as well as the way that the case is being treated as an assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case.",
      "Thompson was the lead prosecutor in the Feeding Our Future case, a COVID-era $250 million scheme which targeted programs that were meant to feed schoolchildren. Since then he's charged defendants for allegedly defrauding housing and autism service programs, claiming that fraud in Minnesota has topped $9 billion, a figure which Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has pushed back on.",
      "The New York Times reported Tuesday that a number of people familiar with Thompson's decision said he also objected to federal investigators refusing to cooperate with Minnesota state agencies in investigating Good's killing.",
      "Doug Kelley, a former assistant U.S. attorney for Minnesota, says the move is a major blow to the credibility of the office moving forward.",
      "\"I've been practicing federal criminal law in this state for 51 years and this is the darkest day in 51 years as far as I can see for the rule of law in Minnesota,\" Kelley said. \"If they feel the need to resign because of orders they have gotten that will violate their consciouses, to me it's a great statement on their part that this is not tolerable by them.\"",
      "Since the massive fraud scandal, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Minnesota's large Somali-American community, as many of the Feeding Our Future defendants are of Somali descent. His administration cited the fraud scandal as impetus for deploying thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area.",
      "Walz called Thompson's resignation a \"huge loss for our state.\"",
      "\"It's also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants,\" Walz said on X.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar said on X that \"these career public servants have served our state through multiple tragedies and critical investigations. We cannot allow prosecutors to be driven by politics. The family and loved ones of Renee Good deserve justice, not political attacks.\"",
      "Thompson also\u00a0filed charges against Vance Boelter, the man accused of killing former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who survived.",

      "She said she was with three classmates at the time, \"sitting in the section that was allowed for colored people,\" when a White woman boarded and moved to the back of the bus, hoping to take a seat. At that time, as Colvin explained, a Black person and a White person could not sit in the same row.",
      "\"I refused because this wasn't an elderly White lady. This was a young White lady,\" Colvin told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview in 2021.",

      "Colvin was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace, breaking segregation law and assaulting a police officer. Two of the charges were dropped, but the charge for assaulting a police officer had stayed with her for more than 60 years.",

      "The top job for 2026: cardiac medical technician. The number of listings for the role on Indeed's website has surged 34% since 2022, while wages have grown by the same amount. Cardiac medical techs earn a median salary of nearly $134,000. Nurse practitioner ranks No. 3, with a median salary of $143,183.",

    "title": "What Trump's 10% credit card rate cap would mean for consumers",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-interest-rate-cap-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:19:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save consumers billions of dollars, but potentially hurt lower-income Americans, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year could save consumers billions of dollars but hurt Americans with lower credit scores, according to financial experts.",
      "The idea, which drew rare support on Monday from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would prevent Americans from being \"ripped off\" by card issuers, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0last week in calling for the rate ceiling. By contrast, the cap has drawn pushback from the banking industry.",
      "After JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would punish consumers and dent the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The average interest rate on credit cards is now nearly 24%, according LendingTree. People with poor credit scores, meanwhile, can pay rates of up to 36%.",
      "Here's how experts say a 10% cap could affect consumers.",
      "Potential tradeoffs",
      "A September 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0from researchers at Vanderbilt University found that a 10% cap on credit card rates would save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments.",
      "With rates at 10%, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance would pay about $42 per month in interest. At the current average rate of 24%, they would owe about $100 per month.",
      "Some credit card analysts, along with the banking industry, contend that a 10% cap on credit card rates could lead to banks cutting off access to credit for low-income consumers and for those with low credit scores.",
      "\"They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.",
      "That could take a toll on the broader economy because subprime consumers would likely pare their spending or turn to pricier types of credit. Credit card spending accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5%, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "For overall economic growth, that would effectively cancel out any increase in consumer spending stemming from lower credit card rates, the investment bank notes.",
      "The American Bankers Association also said in a statement\u00a0that a 10% rate cap \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" such as payday\u00a0or \"buy now pay later\" loans.",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, a site that helps consumers maximize their credit card rewards, said such programs could be diminished if the cap is implemented.",
      "\"Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Yet Shearer disputes claims that capping rates would cause card companies to cut off some consumers, forcing them to turn to riskier types of loans. Rather, credit card issuers are more likely to continue serving such consumers, but could sharply reduce the value of the rewards they offer them, he said.",
      "\"The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,\" he said, noting that credit card issuers have a range of revenue streams.",
      "Issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also make money by charging annual fees and on so-called interchange fees merchants pay to accept credit cards, which wouldn't be affected by the proposed rate cap.",
      "\"Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,\" Shearer said.",
      "Why are credit card rates so high?",
      "Annual percentage rates (APR on credit cards are far higher than auto loan or mortgage rates because the debt is unsecured, Rossman explained.",
      "\"There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,\" he told CBS News. \"The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back,\" he added, explaining the rationale behind double-digit interest rates.",
      "Card companies are also reluctant to reduce rates because that would mean smaller profits.",
      "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how much card issuers can increase rates, but does not put a cap on rates, while also reducing late payment and other fees.",
      "Can Trump really do this?",
      "Some experts think Trump may not have the authority to unilaterally impose a cap on credit card rates. Congress would also face challenges implementing such a cap, according to TD Cowan analyst Jaret Seiberg, although he thinks lawmakers could get behind a higher cap.",
      "\"This is where the risk rises as Democrats have sought to extend the 36% military lending cap to all consumers. It is why that could pass. Enacting a 25% cap would be harder as it could affect first-time credit card holders and subprime applicants,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Shearer said that a bipartisan\u00a0bill, the \"Percent Credit Card Interest Rate Cap Act,\" introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025 could pass if Mr. Trump's allies rallied behind it.",
      "\"It's not going to happen through executive action,\" Shearer said of a cap on interest rates. \"But if he can get the Senate majority leader and speaker to put it up for a vote, it's quite possible the bill would pass.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "At least six prosecutors, most of whom are supervisors in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, will be leaving their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Several career prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division announced they are leaving the department, shortly after they learned there would be no civil rights probe into the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by a federal immigration agent, according to six sources briefed on the matter.",
      "At least six prosecutors, most of whom are supervisors in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, will be leaving their jobs. Their decision to depart was announced in a meeting to staff on Monday, the sources told CBS News.",
      "The announcement came after CBS News reported on Friday that career prosecutors in the section had offered to drop all of their work to help investigate the Minneapolis shooting, but they were told there would be no criminal civil rights investigation. The ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good has been identified as Jonathan Ross, who a DHS source told CBS News last week was previously dragged by a car when trying to arrest a man in Bloomington, Minnesota, six months ago.",
      "Although the Justice Department contemplated treating the investigation as a \"color of law\" civil rights investigation into the excessive use of force, it later changed course, two different sources briefed on the matter told CBS.",
      "Now, the investigation is being treated as an assault on a federal officer, in which Ross, as opposed to Good, is seen as the victim of a crime, the sources added.",
      "CBS could not immediately determine who made that decision.",
      "At least six career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota have also resigned from their jobs, CBS also reported on Tuesday.",
      "Their resignations come as the office faces pressure from senior department leadership to treat the investigation as an assault on a federal officer, rather than a civil rights investigation.",
      "\"There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CBS in a statement.",
      "A Justice Department official confirmed to CBS that leadership in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section gave notice they were going to depart under an early retirement program, and said they sought to participate \"well before the events in Minnesota.\"",
      "\"Any suggestion to the contrary is false,\" the official added.",
      "Several sources told CBS that while most of those departing in the Civil Rights Division criminal section are taking the early retirement option, the timing of the events in Minneapolis factored into their decision to make the announcement this week.",
      "Video footage shows the officer, identified in court records from the prior incident as Ross, fired three rounds at the car as Good started to drive away.",
      "The video also appeared to depict the officers did not take immediate steps to ensure that Good received emergency medical care after the shooting took place. A separate video from the scene showed officers stopping a man who claimed to be a doctor from moving toward Good.",
      "Senior officials in the Trump administration, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have publicly sought to cast blame on Good, alleging she was trying to assault Ross with her car.",
      "But some legal experts say the video evidence shows that the car was turning away from Ross and that is sufficient to justify investigating the case as a civil rights one.",
      "\"Just looking at the totality of the evidence that I see, which is limited, there is enough there to make a criminal inquiry to determine whether there was deprivation of Ms. Good's rights under color of law,\" Julius Nam, a former federal civil rights prosecutor in Los Angeles, told CBS in an interview last week.",
      "The Civil Rights Division has already faced a mass exodus in its ranks since last year, after political leadership drastically altered its mission of historically protecting the country's most vulnerable populations.",
      "Until now, the criminal section had lost fewer attorneys compared with the division's other sections, which collectively lost approximately 75% of their staff in 2025.",
      "The departures, which include that of the section's chief, were not solely driven by Minneapolis, but also by frustrations at how political leaders in the division were handling other cases and sidelining prosecutors, two of the sources said.",
      "Last year, for example, political leadership in the division intervened in a pending sentencing of a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights and assigned a new prosecutor to the case who then asked a federal judge to sentence him to serve just one day in prison.",
      "The judge ultimately sentenced him to serve 33 months.",
      "Then in November, the division abruptly filed a motion to dismiss a case that was just about to go to trial against two officials in a local sheriff's office in the Middle District of Tennessee who were facing charges for using excessive force and trying to hide their alleged misconduct.",
      "Officials in the section were recently offered a chance to retire early,\u00a0 and several of them decided to take it, several of the sources said. The lack of an investigation in Minneapolis was a breaking point for some of them and helped factor into their decision to announce it in a staff meeting, several of the sources added.",
      "The Civil Rights Division's criminal section is responsible for prosecuting hate crimes, as well as cases against law enforcement such as excessive use of force, sexual misconduct, making false arrests or showing deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.",
      "In a statement, NAACP President Derrick Johnson said that if incidents that are visible like the Minneapolis shooting \"are not subjected to full, impartial investigations that genuinely seek accountability, we must wonder how many other cases go unreported, undocumented, or purposefully obscured by an administration that is no longer attempting to conceal its intent to intimidate and silence all who do not conform to its agenda.\"",
      "Although U.S. Attorney's offices can also conduct their own investigations into excessive force by a law enforcement officer, the incident in Minneapolis would likely be deemed to be a case of national significance under Justice Department guidelines because it resulted in death.",
      "In cases of national significance, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division is supposed to coordinate with the local U.S. Attorney's office, the Justice Manual says.",
      "One of the most high-profile civil rights prosecutions by the section in recent years took place in Minneapolis, after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in May 2020.",
      "Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, Floyd's constitutional rights, as well as the rights of a 14-year-old boy in an unrelated case from 2021.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:54:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard two cases involving laws from Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to uphold state laws that\u00a0ban transgender athletes\u00a0from participating in girls' and women's sports, wading for the first time into the contentious issue.",
      "The justices heard more than three hours of arguments in a pair of cases challenging laws from West Virginia and Idaho that require public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated based on biological sex at birth and restrict transgender girls and women from competing on teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "Across the arguments, the justices debated the level of scientific evidence behind whether transgender athletes who have received gender-transition treatments hold any athletic advantage over female competitors, as well as whether the laws discriminate based on sex and transgender status, as two transgender athletes who challenged their states' measures argue.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court could have ramifications for more than half the country: Idaho and West Virginia are among the 27 states that have enacted laws in recent years that forbid participation by transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The two transgender athletes who brought the cases, Lindsay Hecox of Idaho and Becky Pepper-Jackson of West Virginia, filed lawsuits challenging the laws in their respective states several years ago, arguing that they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs. The bans, the athletes said, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, and treat them worse than their peers. Lower courts ruled in favor of Hecox and Pepper-Jackson.",
      "But Idaho and West Virginia officials asserted that their bans do not discriminate based on transgender status and draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. They said that the laws' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the growth of girls' and women's sports since Title IX was enacted 50 years ago is one of the \"successes in America,\" and he warned that allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's sports teams threatened to \"undermine or reverse\" that success. He said sports are typically a \"zero-sum game,\" and transgender athletes can displace girls and women if they are selected for a team or take their place on a podium.",
      "\"For the individual girl who does not make the team or doesn't get on the stand for the medal or doesn't make all-league, there's a harm there, and I think we can't sweep that aside,\" Kavanaugh said. He later sought to clarify that a ruling from the Supreme Court on Title IX grounds would be specific to sports and unlikely to open the door to policies that separate males and females in the classroom or other activities.",
      "Kavanaugh also said that when Congress enacted Title IX decades ago, it understood \"sex\" to mean biological sex at birth, and it would be up to lawmakers today to adjust the definition in the law.",
      "Some of the justices sought to test the lines of when it would be permissible under Title IX for girls and boys to be treated differently. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed the hypothetical scenario of boys having separate high school remedial programs, while Justices Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett raised examples of proficiency in chess or calculus.",
      "Barrett and Justice Clarence Thomas also questioned whether boys who are less athletically skilled than their male peers could try out for girls' teams if the laws were wiped away.",
      "But some of the liberal justices said that Pepper-Jackson and Hecox, as well as other transgender athletes like them, are seeking an exception to the state bans. Lawyers for the athletes told the court they received medical interventions that do not give them an unfair edge over girls and women competing against them.",
      "\"I would think the state would just have to make exceptions where people can demonstrate that the justification that makes the state's conduct constitutional doesn't apply to them,\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.",
      "Joshua Block, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued on behalf of Pepper-Jackson, told the justices that she and Hecox are categorically excluded from all sports, and said some states are using the definition of \"sex\" to deny athletic opportunity. He urged the Supreme Court not to issue a broad ruling, but to instead allow the district court to evaluate the facts and evidence related to athletic advantage.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",
      "Little v. Hecox",
      "Idaho was the first state in the nation to enact a law barring transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" Under the law, athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law and argued it is unconstitutional and a violation of Title IX. Hecox, who takes hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Madison Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, are defending the law. Kenyon and Marshall competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University and placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"If women don't have their own competitions, they won't be able to compete,\" Alan Hurst, Idaho's solicitor general, told the high court. \"Gender identity does not matter in sports, and that's why Idaho's law does not classify on the basis of gender identity. It treats all males equally and all females equally, regardless of identity.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye ruled in favor of Hecox in 2020, and blocked enforcement of the ban, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to the Idaho and West Virginia laws. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot. She decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "West Virginia v. B.P.J.",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted its ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" The law states that athletic teams or sports designated for females \"shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The debate over transgender athletes",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say, and they argue that neither she nor Hecox have any athletic advantage over their female competitors because they've received gender-transition treatments.",
      "But West Virginia officials argue that as a result of Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports, she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season.",
      "West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials warned that the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Maintaining separate boys and girls sports teams ensures that girls can safely and fairly compete in school sports. The question today is whether this enduring structure can continue,\" Williams told the justices. \"It can. Title IX permits sex-separated teams. It does so because biological sex matters in athletics in ways both obvious and undeniable.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Idaho officials assert that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say their law is motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes, because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and not eliminated by medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",
      "On the other side, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. But the legal teams for both transgender athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In Pepper-Jackson's challenge to West Virginia's law, her legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "The legal battles over the state bans for transgender athletes are the latest involving LGBTQ rights to land before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the court divided 6-3 in finding that protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII extend to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts joined Gorsuch and the three liberal justices in the majority, though he suggested when debating the sports-participation bans that the reasoning in that earlier case may not extend to these legal battles.",
      "\"The question here is whether or not a sex-based classification is necessarily a transgender classification,\" he said.",
      "In its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-trump-mortgage-rates-home-prices/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:25:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:48:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona filed a civil lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay, which he claims amounts to unconstitutional retaliation against him.",
      "In a 46-page complaint, Kelly, a retired Navy captain, argued that he is the target of \"extreme rhetoric and punitive retribution\" by the Trump administration over a video in which he and other lawmakers urged members of the military to \"refuse illegal orders.\" Kelly asked a federal judge to set aside Hegseth's recent moves\u00a0and block the enforcement of any punishment against him.",
      "The Arizona Democratic senator alleged that he was punished for protected speech and said administration officials retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment. Kelly also argued that his criticisms of Hegseth are at the core of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which provides immunity to lawmakers from criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits that stem from legislative acts.",
      "\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" Kelly's legal team wrote in the complaint. \"Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.\"",
      "They said Kelly's public statements and legislative acts in response to the Trump administration's actions regarding the military are \"significant matters of public concern\" that fit within the First Amendment's protections and his oversight responsibilities as a senator. The senator's lawyers added that they believe there is no legal basis to take action against him based on \"post-retirement political speech.\"",
      "Kelly said in a statement that Hegseth's efforts to punish him leave military veterans at risk of seeing their rank and pay downgraded years after they retire for making comments that he or other defense secretaries dislike.",
      "\"His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn't like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted,\" Kelly said.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a Pentagon official said, \"We are aware of the litigation. However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"",
      "Hegseth, meanwhile, accused the senator of being \"worried and cranky.\"",
      "\"'Captain' Kelly knows exactly what he did, and that he will be held to account,\" he\u00a0wrote Tuesday on social media.",
      "Kelly and his colleagues came under fierce criticism by the Trump administration after they posted the video in November. The video was published amid the military buildup around Venezuela and strikes against alleged drug boats, and featured five other Democratic lawmakers who served in the U.S. military or in the intelligence community. They have not faced any adverse action from the Defense Department as they do not draw retirement pay from the U.S. military.",
      "President Trump and Hegseth lambasted the lawmakers for the comments, claiming that their statements amounted to \"sedition\" and \"treason.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed Kelly's statements \"undermined the chain of command\" and constituted \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" The Pentagon\u00a0announced it was conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Kelly to determine whether he should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.",
      "The Defense Department said in December it was \"escalating\" its review into a command investigation.",
      "Hegseth announced\u00a0last week that the Pentagon had \"initiated retirement grade determination proceedings\" that could result in a \"reduction in his retired grade\" and \"a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\" Hegseth also said he issued a formal letter to censure Kelly, citing his \"reckless misconduct.\"",
      "\"This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file,\" Hegseth added.",
      "Under federal law, retired U.S. military members can receive non-judicial punishments or even be charged, court-martialed and punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the system of rules and regulations established by Congress governing the military.",

    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

      "On Dec. 16, 2021, Darci Bass was standing in her local convenience store when the man who stood accused of the shooting death of her 19-year-old daughter Livye Lewis strolled in. \"When he came in the door ... I just went \u2014 started \u2014 started throwing whatever at him and went for him,\" Bass told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant in an interview for \"The Blackout Murder of Livye Lewis.\"",
      "An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, Jan. 17 at 9/8c on CBS and and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "It all began in the early morning hours of Halloween 2020, when Lewis was discovered on the side of a road in the tiny town of Hemphill, Texas. She was draped over the steering wheel of her car, dead from a rifle shot to the neck.",
      "Bass says she was not notified by police of her daughter's death. Instead, she heard from a friend that Lewis was in trouble and showed up at the crime scene demanding answers. \"I just needed to know is she alive or is she dead,\" Bass told Van Sant. Her anguished cries for answers were caught on police bodycam video. \"I wanna see my child,\" she shouted. \"Livye Lewis! Where is she?\"",
      "Sabine County Sheriff's Investigator J.P. MacDonough says that the minute he saw Lewis' body, he knew that Lewis' killer was no stranger to her. \"She was just sitting there with her legs crossed,\" he tells Van Sant. \"Well, it indicates to me she was not afraid ... She was actually, to some degree, comfortable with who she was speaking with.\"",
      "MacDonough says he didn't have to look very far for a suspect. Also discovered at the crime scene was Lewis' boyfriend, 23-year-old Matthew Edgar. \"He was found in the fetal position behind the vehicle that Lewis was found in,\" says MacDonough. Beside Edgar was his rifle.",
      "Edgar was rushed from the scene of the crime in an ambulance. Bloodied but not injured, he is seen on police bodycam footage lying in a hospital bed, being interviewed by MacDonough.",
      "\"When was the last time you saw Livye?\" MacDonough asks Edgar. \"Tonight,\" he answers, and then claims to have no memory of how he ended up at the crime scene. \"You don't know how you ended up on the ground behind the car ... With the dead girl in it,\" says MacDonough. \"No, sir,\" Edgar replies. \"I have no clue.\"",
      "But for Edgar's defense attorney Rob Hughes, it was not an open-and-shut case. \"We got all the DNA results back and ... there were some holes in the case,\" Hughes tells Van Sant. \"There were no fingerprints taken or DNA lifted off the gun.\"",
      "Shaun Dunn, who calls himself a close friend of Edgar's, tells \"48 Hours\" that he believes Edgar when he says he can't recall how he ended up at the crime scene. Dunn thinks that, like Lewis, Edgar was a victim and that someone else pulled the trigger. \"I believe it was someone that was ... close to Matthew,\" he says. \"Someone that was involved in events of that evening.\"",
      "But where Dunn sees a victim, MacDonough saw a suspect and arrested Edgar while he was lying in that hospital bed. Then, months later, Bass says that while she was praying for justice, Edgar was released. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the courts and with no grand juries being convened, Texas law required that a still-unindicted Edgar be allowed out on bail.",
      "It was months after Edgar's release when he walked into that convenience store in Bass' neighborhood. \"And I just remember saying, 'You killed my daughter ... you killed my daughter.'\" According to MacDonough, Bass chased Edgar into the parking lot, where she grabbed a chain in the bed of his truck and started slinging it across his windshield. Bass says she just wanted some answers: \"She loved you and she was good to you and your kids and to your family. What made you think that this was the answer to anything that was going on?\"",
      "Edgar called the sheriff's office and filed a complaint against Bass, who was then charged with assault caused by bodily injury, retaliation and criminal mischief. An arrest warrant was issued and Bass turned herself in. The charges were eventually dropped.",
      "On March 16, 2021, four-and-a-half months after his arrest, a grand jury heard the evidence against Edgar and indicted him for the murder of Lewis. But Edgar, who was still out on bail during his trial, was not done breaking the law. On the fourth day of trial, Edgar let the battery on his ankle monitor die and went on the run. His trial went on without him, and the jury found him guilty. But it took authorities 11 months to capture Edgar, so he could be sentenced to 99 years, with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",

      "About two hours before Lewis was found in her car, she was at a friend's pre-Halloween party. Edgar, her ex-boyfriend, and his ex-wife, Montana Bockel, were also there. Lewis had broken up with Edgar a few weeks before, and according to the party's host, Bobby Ozan, Lewis and Bockel were enjoying the night while ignoring Edgar.",
      "By 2:30 a.m., most people had already left the party except Lewis and Bockel. According to Bockel's first interview with investigators, Edgar suddenly returned to Ozan's house and overheard that Lewis was going to spend the night with Ozan.",
      "This made Edgar so furious that he started attacking Bockel, feeling she could have stopped Lewis. He was also kicking Bockel's car.",
      "Ozan tried to restrain Edgar, giving Bockel and Lewis a chance to escape. Bockel headed to Edgar's grandparents' home seeking refuge, but it is unclear where Lewis was headed.",
      "Once inside Edgar's grandparents' home, Bockel began texting Edgar. Those texts would become key evidence in the case.",

      "Bass' interaction with officers at the scene was captured on bodycam footage. She asked at least 23 times where Lewis was, but authorities seemed reluctant to tell her. Finally, once they said Lewis was sitting in her car, Bass dropped to the ground, realizing her daughter had been killed.",
      "7:28 a.m. | Hospital interview with Matthew Edgar",
      "While the scene investigation continued,. MacDonough met with Edgar at the hospital. He captured the entire encounter on bodycam.",
      "A bloodied Edgar claimed he did not remember how he ended up on the ground on the side of the road. After admitting he drank an entire bottle of whiskey the night before, Edgar says the last thing he remembers is falling asleep on his porch and then waking up in the ambulance.",
      "MacDonough informed Edgar that Lewis was found dead in her car. Edgar appears to cry but MacDonough wasn't buying his story. MacDonough arrested Matthew Edgar for Livye Lewis' murder while he was still on that hospital bed.",
      "Around 8:15 a.m. | DNA evidence",
      "While at the hospital MacDonough also gathered Edgar's clothing as evidence. DNA testing revealed a tiny drop of Lewis' blood on Edgar's pants that later became key evidence for prosecutors.",
      "But Edgar's defense attorney, Rob Hughes, argued it was impossible to tell how long the blood had been there.",

      "Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Musk's children, is one of the alleged victims. She said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Tuesday that Grok allowed users to generate and publish sexual deepfake images of her to X without permission, including manipulating photos of her as a minor.",
      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",
      "The mother of two, who has a 1-year-old son with Musk, said she asked Grok to take the photos down.",
      "\"Grok said, 'I confirm that you don't consent. I will no longer produce these images.' And then it continued to produce more and more images, and more and more explicit images,\" she said.",

      "\"This can be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" St. Clair said.",
      "St. Clair said her issue is with the Chatbot, not Musk \u2013 who recently said he plans to file for sole custody of their child over allegations that St. Clair \"might\" transition their son. A source close to St. Clair said that is \"absurd and unequivocally false.\"",
      "\"If they want to say my bone to pick is \u2026 the chatbot undressing minors and myself and stripping me nude, yes. You're right. I have a bone to pick with that and I don't care who's doing it. So Elon's not special about me speaking out on this,\" St. Clair said.",
      "CBS News reached out to Musk and has not received a response yet.

    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, a 2023 Urban Institute\u00a0study\u00a0found.",

      "Washington \u2014 Bill and Hillary Clinton refused to appear before the House Oversight Committee to testify as part of its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, setting up a legal confrontation as the Republican-led panel threatens to hold them in contempt of Congress.",
      "Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the committee's chairman, said the panel will move next week on holding former President Bill Clinton in contempt. Similar action is expected for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "If the committee votes to hold them in contempt, it would advance to the full House for a vote on whether to recommend the matter to the Justice Department for prosecution.",
      "The panel subpoenaed the former president and former secretary of state in August as part of the investigation. The committee had requested that Bill Clinton appear on Tuesday and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.",
      "In a separate eight-page letter to Comer, the Clintons' attorneys made it clear they would not appear for the closed-door questioning.",
      "\"President and Secretary Clinton have already provided the limited information they possess about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the Committee,\" the Clintons' attorneys said in the letter dated Jan. 12, which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They did so proactively and voluntarily, and despite the fact that the Subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers,\" the letter said.",
      "In a separate letter to Comer on Tuesday that was signed by the Clintons, they noted that several other former officials were subpoenaed as part of the investigation and not forced to testify. In August, the committee also subpoenaed former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller.",
      "\"We are confident that any reasonable person in or out of Congress will see, based on everything we release, that what you are doing is trying to punish those who you see as your enemies and to protect those you think are your friends,\" the Clintons wrote.",
      "\"Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,\" they said. \"For us, now is that time.\"",
      "The Clintons' attorneys called the effort \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass\" President Trump's political rivals. Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0called on the Justice Department to release any Epstein-related materials that name Democrats to \"embarrass them.\"",
      "Bill Clinton has appeared in photos with Epstein and took a handful of trips with him decades ago, but has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The materials also contain references to Mr. Trump, who also has not been accused of any misconduct.",
      "\"No one's accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,\" Comer told reporters Tuesday after the former president failed to show up.",
      "The Clintons' legal team and the committee have been going back and forth for months over the requested depositions. The committee initially requested they appear in October, but then delayed the date until December. Both Clintons declined the December dates, citing the need to attend a funeral.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees.",
      "The Clintons' lawyers called on Comer to \"engage in good faith to de-escalate this dispute.\"",
      "\"Oversight Democrats have always said that the Committee is willing to talk to any person who has information about Jeffrey Epstein,\" Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for Democrats on the committee, said in a statement. \"Cooperating with Congress is important and the Committee should continue working with President Clinton's team to obtain any information that might be relevant to our investigation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights,\" Polis said. \"When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere.\"",
    "story": [
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat finishing out his final term who has at times found himself at odds with his party on key national issues, says the best way to understand his politics is that he is \"pro-freedom.\"",
      "That extends to more benign issues like allowing kids to operate lemonade stands without a permit, to larger concerns like legalizing so-called \"magic mushrooms,\"\u00a0which Polis supported, and vaccine mandates, which Polis opposes.",
      "\"I'm pro-vax, me and my family are vaxxed,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"I don't think the government should force you to get vaxxed. ... So, pro-freedom.\"",
      "Asked Monday about the recent changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance on childhood vaccines, recommending fewer immunizations than were previously suggested, Polis said, \"Those are recommendations, obviously.\"",
      "\"We [Colorado] use some of the national recommendations, that, you know, again, it's up to each parent to make that decision for their kids,\" Polis said. \"It's good to put the best possible information in front of people. In most cases, getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your health and your kid's health.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has called the CDC's changes dangerous and said it would continue giving its own guidance.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back voters who chose to support President Trump because of his campaign promises to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a major role in his administration, Polis told CBS News, \"I think Democrats should be the party of health.\"",
      "He said a main component of that is making health care more affordable, but he lamented that Democrats have not been as vocal about issues like \"the dangers of highly processed foods,\" healthy school meals, and insecticides, as some Republicans have been.",
      "\"Remember, it's nobody's goal to have to have health care. It's your goal to just stay healthy, and a lot of that comes down to diet, nutrition and exercise,\" Polis said. \"And it shouldn't he a partisan message. Colorado has the lowest obesity rate of any state. We're proud of that. We have a great outdoor lifestyle. That's something that we should really take across the country.\"",
      "Asked how far his \"pro-freedom\" stance goes, Polis said, \"I'm not an anarchist.\"",
      "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights. ... When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere,\" he said. \"When you start interfering with your neighbors and those around you, there's a very appropriate role of government to step in and say, 'They deserve their freedom too.'\"",
      "Polis' interview comes amid the Trump administration's attempts to deny Colorado and some other Democratic-led states billions of dollars in social service funding over allegations of fraud \u2014 allegations that have, in part, led to the surge of federal agents in Minneapolis, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last week.",
      "\"We welcome any way to look at fraud and defeat it. I mean, we see the federal government as a partner in that,\" Polis said. \"Freezing it [the funding] before they found any fraud, that's really inappropriate.\"",
      "\"We have one of the lower fraud rates of any state,\" Polis said. \"Every state's going to have some misuse of funds. We have one of the lower ones.\"",
      "Polis said that, during his time in office, national politics have become \"more vitriolic.\"",
      "\"To step down to the level of personal attacks and undermine the motives of others is really what's dangerous in today's society,\" he said. \"What bothers me the most is the huge gap in perceptions of what Democrats think Republicans believe and what Republicans think Democrats believe. Most Americans are good, honest, hardworking Americans who want to make their country a better place. And we need to celebrate that commonality.\"",
      "Polis said he believes the two parties often work better at the state level than at the national level, and noted that about half of all Coloradans don't even belong to a political party. He touted the success of direct democracy, such as ballot initiatives that led to the legalization of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms in the state, as well as measures such as ranked choice voting, which Denver and Boulder both use for their mayoral elections.",
      "\"I think a multi-party system would be healthier in many ways,\" he said of America's de facto two-party political system.",

      "The death of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday, has sparked national outcry.",
      "Her father, Timothy Ganger, tells \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil that she was the kind of person who always cared deeply about other people. He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, and had three children of her own \u2014 two from her first marriage and a 6-year-old from her second. Her father said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her husband.",
      "Good, who was a U.S. citizen, was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and was not a target for arrest by ICE agents, city leaders said.",
      "\"Renee Nicole Good was a wife, mother, poet, singer, member of the LGBTQI+ community, and United States citizen,\" the\u00a012 co-chairs of the Congressional Equality Caucus\u00a0said in a joint statement released Saturday. The Openly-LGBTQI+ U.S. Representatives called for a full, transparent and open investigation into the shooting.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports she had just dropped her 6-year-old off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "Good's father said the orphaned child has a loving extended family and will be \"well taken care of.\"",
      "Here's more about what we know so far about Good and the fatal shooting.",
      "A \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who recently moved to Minneapolis",
      "Renee Good described herself in the bio of her Instagram profile as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who was currently \"experiencing Minneapolis.\"",
      "Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning. Ganger told the newspaper that her daughter wasn't part of a protest and said her daughter \"was probably terrified.\"",
      "\"Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,\" Ganger told the Tribune. \"She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"",
      "After working briefly in banking in Colorado, her father said she moved east, got a degree from Old Dominion University in Virginia, becoming a poet and English teacher. She was working as a substitute teacher in Minneapolis, he said.",
      "Her first husband told the AP that Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union before spending some time as a stay-at-home mother in recent years.",
      "Good was widowed when her husband, Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., died in 2023 at age 36, the Tribune reported. He was the father of her 6-year-old son; AP reported that Good's two older children are a 12-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter.",
      "In a statement released to Minnesota Public Radio, her wife, Becca Good, who was in the car during the shooting, thanked people from all over the country who reached out to show their support.",
      "\"if you ever encountered my wife, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, you know that above all else, she was kind. In fact, kindness radiated out of her,\" she wrote.",
      "\"Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world and we need to do everything we can to find it where it resides and nurture it where it needs to grow. Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion in December 2020 and received a poetry prize from the university, the English department announced in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0that year. The post said Good studied creative writing and hosted a podcast.",
      "\"It is with great sadness that Old Dominion University mourns the loss of one of our own, Renee (Macklin) Good,\" said Brian Hemphill, the university's president, in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0Hemphill described her death as a \"tragic killing\" and \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.\"",
      "AP also reports it appears she was never charged with anything involving law enforcement beyond a traffic ticket.",
      "\"Devastated for that whole family\"",
      "Joan Rose, who was Good's former neighbor in Kansas City, Missouri, told CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0that Good's family had lived across the street from her until December 2024. Rose said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\" Good had lived in the Waldo neighborhood with her partner, young son and dogs, and Rose said the two older children routinely visited them.",
      "Rose said she thought Good's family had planned to move to Canada when they left Missouri last year.",
      "\"I heard they were moving to Canada because of the politics here,\" she told KCTV. \"I had thought about them sometimes, you know, passing by their house thinking, 'Oh, I hope they're OK in Canada, you know, I hope that they're living, you know, a good life and that they're, they're worry free.' And this is just the opposite of that. So, I'm just devastated for that whole family.\"",
      "A GoFundMe campaign established in the wake of the shooting is asking the public to \"support the wife and son of Renee Good as they grapple with the devastating loss of their wife and mother.\"",
      "\"Renee was pure sunshine, pure, love,\" reads the fundraiser's description. \"She will be desperately missed.\"",
      "The campaign has raised nearly $500,000 as of Thursday morning.",
      "A community vigil held for Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday night drew a large crowd of attendees, many of whom shared emotional and frustrated remarks about the latest ICE operations that have recently ramped up across the region,\u00a0CBS Minnesota\u00a0reported. Protests also took place in other cities around the U.S.",
      "The agent involved in the shooting was part of a surge of roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers\u00a0the Trump administration recently deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a response to both immigration and Minnesota's\u00a0fraud scandal.",
      "Shooting captured on video",
      "Police responded to a call reporting the shooting, which happened in a neighborhood in south Minneapolis, at about 9:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to the city. When officers arrived, they found that a woman, later identified as Good, had been shot in the head. She was rushed by firefighters to a Minneapolis hospital, where she later died, the city said.",
      "Federal officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, characterized the shooting as an act of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent who fired the weapon when the driver \"attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\" However, numerous witnesses and local leaders are questioning that account.",
      "Multiple videos have circulated online of the incident, which show the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV on a residential street when an ICE agent approached and addressed her through the window of her vehicle. Several other agents stood nearby.",
      "In one of the videos, an officer can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" before reaching for the Honda's door handle. At that point, the Honda is seen backing up as another agent steps in front of the car. The Honda then begins to drive away, and the agent in front of it fires his weapon into the car. Whether the agent was hit by the car, as federal officials have said, is not clear based on the videos. They show the agent move to the side of the SUV as he fires several more shots, and the car moves forward down the street before crashing into another car.",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was originally assigned to investigate Good's death jointly with FBI, but the state agency has since withdrawn from the case and alleged federal authorities restricted its access to evidence, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "The BCA said the U.S. Attorney's Office \"reversed course\" and informed the agency that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI.\"",

      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",
      "Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents \"stay out of our schools.\"",

      "Greenland's prime minister said \"we choose Denmark\" over the U.S., on the eve of\u00a0Wednesday's meeting\u00a0between the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump administration officials.",
      "\"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,\" Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference Tuesday in Copenhagen. \"We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.\"",
      "Nielsen appeared with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said \"there are many indications that the most challenging part is ahead of us,\" according to AFP.",
      "Vance, who visited Greenland last year, will be hosting Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers \u2014 along with Rubio \u2014 at the White House, a source familiar with the planning confirmed to CBS News.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons.",
      "\"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" he added. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "But leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is\u00a0considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"One thing must be clear to everyone: Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States. Greenland does not want to be part of the United States,\" Nielsen said Tuesday.",
      "Denmark has been one of the U.S.' staunchest NATO allies for more than 75 years. Frederiksen said of the U.S. there's been \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Senate Democrats and a few Republicans have expressed opposition to military action against Greenland. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that any military action in Greenland would be \"disastrous.\" He added that he believes \"Congress will stop him, both Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that he would \"do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\" But Paul did not object to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "The Constitution says only Congress can declare war, and the Senate last week advanced a war powers resolution to limit the Trump administration's ability to conduct further strikes Venezuela. Five Republicans joined all the Democrats in advancing the resolution, indicating a lack of support for any military action in Greenland. Democratic Sen. Reuben Gallego said last week that he expected to introduce a measure \"to block Trump from invading Greenland.\"",
      "A bipartisan group of House members introduced legislation on Monday to prevent military action against NATO members, according to Politico.",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, one of the sponsors of the legislation, said last week that he thought any action in Greenland is wrong.",
      "\"These are our allies,\" he continued. \"You don't treat your allies this way. I mean it's embarrassing. And by the way, most Greenlanders want to be Greenland. They don't want to be American. They want to be our allies, though, and it's creating a lot of anger and hurt with our friends in Europe.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as \"Havana Syndrome,\" which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of \"Havana Syndrome,\" a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",

      "A new arrest has been made in connection to the notorious 2023 gold heist in which millions of dollars' worth of gold bars were stolen at Toronto Pearson Airport, Canadian police said Monday.",
      "Officers arrested and charged 43-year-old Arsalan Chaudhary when he arrived at the Toronto airport Monday on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, police said in a news release.",
      "Chaudhary is charged with theft, two counts of possession of property obtained by crime, and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. He was held for a bail hearing in Brampton, in the greater Toronto area, police said.",
      "On April 17, 2023, a flight from Zurich, Switzerland, landed at the Toronto airport carrying a cargo shipment that included approximately 400 kilograms (about 880 pounds) of .9999 pure gold bars, worth more than $20 million Canadian (about $14.4 million in U.S. dollars), and $2.5 million Canadian in foreign currency.",
      "The shipment was reported missing the following day from the Air Canada warehouse.",
      "The police soon found that a suspect who arrived at the warehouse with a truck and a fake airway bill had loaded the gold shipment onto the truck and stolen it.",
      "The Peel Regional Police, who are responsible for the airport area, launched an investigation they dubbed \"Project 24K.\"",
      "\"This investigation demonstrates the dedication and expertise of Peel Regional Police in tackling complex, high-stakes crime,\" Peel Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said in a statement. \"Project 24K is a clear example of how our officers, working alongside national and international partners, can disrupt sophisticated criminal activity and hold those responsible accountable. Let it be known: no matter where you try to run or hide, we will find you.\"",
      "According to police, it was the largest gold heist in Canadian history.",
      "To date, 10 people have been charged or are wanted, and two individuals remain outstanding, including one subject to an extradition request who is believed to be in India.",
      "One of the suspects, Durante King-Mclean, was arrested in Pennsylvania in 2023, accused of driving the truck.",
      "The police have recovered only a small portion of the gold and some cash so far.",
      "\"We can confirm that investigators have recovered approximately one kilogram of .9999% pure gold, which had been crudely fashioned into bangles,\" police said in a statement. \"In addition, we seized approximately $450,000 CAD, which we believe represents a portion of the profits generated through this illicit activity.\"",
      "They said the investigation indicates the gold was sent overseas from Canada \"to markets in India and/or Dubai, where it was melted down and reintroduced into the market for profit.\"",
      "An investigation by CBS News's Canadian partner, CBC News's Fifth Estate, said that based on documents, authorities believe the heist was planned and executed by a highly organised group that mainly relied on an insider.",
      "Police told CBC News's investigation that Chaudhary was \"the most involved in the planning the theft,\" described as the \"Top Dog.\"",

    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for more than\u00a0two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with demonstrations in at least 185 cities around the country. An internet blackout impeded communications and made it difficult to know the scope of the protests \u2014 or the crackdown that appeared to be escalating.",
      "Estimates of the death toll jumped sharply on Jan. 13. Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in Parliament that the U.K. government believed there \"may have been 2,000 people killed, there have been more. My fear is that the number may prove to be significantly higher.\"",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, told\u00a0CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed. Activist groups were working to compile a full death toll based on reports from medical officials across the country. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the massive death toll indicated by the source inside Iran.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "Protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA, and the death toll rose as protests entered their third week.",
      "CBS News has verified that video posted online shows the bodies of at least 366 and likely more than 400 people killed amid the protest piled up at a morgue in a Tehran suburb. The video appears to show forensic personnel documenting gruesome injuries on the bodies, and crowds of people seemingly trying to identify the dead.",
      "The injuries visible are extensive and include gunshot wounds, \"birdshot\" shotgun wounds, gashes and other severe injuries.",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press \u2014 a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access beginning Jan. 8\u00a0across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued into Jan. 11, writing on social media that \"national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels.\"",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order a U.S. intervention if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!,\" the president wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 10.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Jan. 11 that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi \u2014 whose father, the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power \u2014 has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

    "summary": "British public broadcaster BBC wants a Florida court to throw out Trump's lawsuit, with lawyers arguing a lack of jurisdiction.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, will file a motion to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit brought by President Trump over a 2024 documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech together, according to a document filed with the court on Monday. The BBC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Mr. Trump's attorneys are wrong to claim he suffered damages due to the documentary.",
      "The suit, filed last month by Mr. Trump's legal team in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team is seeking $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion, court filings reviewed by CBS News show.",
      "The 33-page complaint filed by Mr. Trump's attorneys in December accuses the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a documentary for the BBC's \"Panorama\" program, which was broadcast in the U.K. a week before the 2024 U.S. election.",
      "One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in the same address. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "In the latest court documents released Monday, the BBC's legal team said it will argue that the Florida court should dismiss the suit because the \"defamation case arises out of a documentary that Defendants the British Broadcasting Corporation (\"the BBC\"), BBC Studios Distribution Ltd., and BBC Studios Productions Ltd. did not create in Florida, produce in Florida, or air in Florida.\"",
      "Attorneys for the BBC will also argue that the case did not cause damage to or defame Mr. Trump, noting the fact that he was re-elected after the documentary was broadcast in Britain, and that Mr. Trump won the state of Florida decisively.",
      "The BBC's legal team also argues that a claim made in Mr. Trump's suit, alleging that the documentary was made available in the U.S. via a streaming service, is inaccurate.",
      "\"Plaintiff alleges that the Documentary was available in the U.S. on the streaming service BritBox. But simply clicking on the link that Plaintiff cites for this point shows it is not on BritBox. Nor was it ever available on BritBox,\" according to the filing submitted by law firm Ballard Spahr, which is representing the BBC.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team has not provided evidence that the documentary was created \"with actual malice,\" Ballard Spahr said Monday.",
      "\"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings,\" a BBC spokesperson told CBS News on Tuesday when asked about the organization's move to have the suit dismissed.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement: \"The BBC is liable to President Trump for intentionally and maliciously defaming him by distorting and manipulating his speech. No amount of attempted legal maneuvers can change that fact. President Trump will continue to hold accountable the BBC and all those who traffic in fake news.\"",
      "The BBC formally apologized to Mr. Trump in November, saying in a statement that the edited soundbite in the Panorama documentary had given, \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the BBC's legal team said at the time, adding that it had \"no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",

To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him,\" the statement said.",
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department on Friday stemming from an\u00a0investigation into its chair\u00a0over the cost of building renovations, Powell said in a video statement shared on Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, during which he spoke about a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings, according to Powell.",
      "He said in his video statement that the move by the Department of Justice should, however, be \"seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" said Powell. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",
      "Multiple former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries\u00a0have also condemned the Trump administration's probe, as have members of Congress from both parties.",

      "More than 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine were seized from clandestine laboratories in Mexico, authorities announced on Monday, days after President Trump threatened possible military action to curb cartels in the country.",
      "In separate operations, authorities found the secret labs along with more than 700 kilograms (1,543 pounds) of meth, as well as various chemical precursors, in the states of Durango, Sinaloa and Michoac\u00e1n, the Mexican navy said in a news release.",
      "During a land patrol in the town of Carricitos, Durango, a hidden laboratory was found with 1,150 liters and 695 kilograms of chemical precursors and material used for the production of synthetic drugs.",
      "\"The laboratory had extensive operating areas, materials and accessories for the production of synthetic drugs, which were completely disabled in order to prevent their reuse,\" the navy said.",
      "The second operation took place in Sinaloa, which is home to the notorious cartel of the same name. In the town of Los Cedros, authorities uncovered a lab where about 750 kilograms of finished meth were seized, as well as 1,150 liters and 695 kilograms of chemical precursors.",
      "Finally, in the violence-wracked western state of Michoac\u00e1n, in the town of La Escondida, another lab was discovered. Authorities seized 9,700 liters and 500 kilograms of chemical precursors, as well as laboratory equipment and tools.",
      "The navy said it destroyed the labs, and\u00a0released video and photos of the operation on social media.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 04:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the Earth warms, new shipping routes from one side of the globe to the other are opening around Greenland, making the vast island a strategic priority for superpowers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants the United States to control Greenland, refusing to take military action off the table and declaring that he will make the semi-autonomous Danish territory part of the U.S. \"one way or the other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs to control the vast, largely frozen island that sits mostly inside the Arctic Circle for security reasons, accusing China and Russia of trying to take it over instead.",
      "Greenland's own democratically elected leaders have rejected any U.S. takeover, with the island's government calling it something they \"cannot accept under any circumstance.\"",
      "There are a number of reasons why Greenland is of such intense interest to the Trump administration, including its natural resources \u2014\u00a0 reserves of oil, natural gas and rare earth minerals. But the physical location of the island on the map \u2014 and the sea ice melting around its borders \u2014 is also of vital importance.",
      "New routes around the globe",
      "Melting Arctic sea ice has created more opportunity to use northern shipping routes \u2014 allowing logistics companies to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking much shorter paths between Asia and Western Europe and the United States.\u00a0 Northern routes were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable, the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which follows Russia's roughly 15,000-mile northern border. That path doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China have agreed to develop the route together, and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the NSR in the winter in February 2021, proving it was possible.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes much closer to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely the path the Trump administration is concerned with.",
      "The other, longstanding way to get goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia is to go south. But that course, through Egypt's Suez Canal, is about 3,000 miles longer.",
      "According to the Arctic Institute, compared to the Suez Canal route, the Northern Sea Route can save shippers as much as 50% in costs, considering fuel and other expenses, by reducing the distance from Japan to Europe, for instance, to only about 10 days compared to the roughly 22 it would take to sail around the southern tip of Africa and then through the Suez Canal.",
      "A 2024 analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies also said the northern route would shave about 10 days of a similar journey from Shanghai, China, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.",
      "As sea temperatures continue warming and winter ice cover shrinks, shipping traffic via the north is likely to increase, so control over that passage \u2014 and the long Greenlandic coastline that it skirts \u2014 will be of greater importance.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shared graphs in 2022 predicting the new routes that would become available to regular tankers around Greenland over the coming decades.",
      "NOAA's modeling shows a dramatic increase in viable journeys for both polar-class vessels fortified to forge through sea ice, and normal open water-faring ships. The agency even predicts that by 2059, it will likely be possible for a polar-class vessel to sail the most direct route, right across the North Pole, as the formation of sea ice reduces further.",

      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell on Monday, Pahlavi said, \"We need action to be taken.\"",
      "\"The best way to ensure that there will be less people killed in Iran is to intervene sooner, so this regime finally collapses and puts an end to all the problems that we are facing,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi has lived in exile since his father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power.",
      "He said he has communicated with the Trump administration, but did not disclose details from their conversations.",
      "He also said the Islamic Republic's recent outreach to the administration is a ploy to try to extinguish the nationwide protests that threaten the rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday night that he spoke with Iranian leaders on Saturday, saying that they \"called to negotiate\" as he threatens military action against the regime.

      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that all options remain on the table, including airstrikes.",
      "Pahlavi said Mr. Trump's red lines have already been crossed by the regime, which is now \"trying to trick\" the world into thinking it's ready to negotiate a way out of the unrest.",
      "\"The game-changer would be for this regime to know that they cannot rely anymore on a continued campaign of repression without the world reacting to it,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether he was pushing Mr. Trump to initiate regime change, Pahlavi said that the president stands in solidarity with the Iranian people, which means \"ultimately supporting them in their ask.\"",

      "When asked whether it's responsible to send Iranians to their deaths by encouraging them to take to the streets as the regime wages a violent crackdown, Pahlavi didn't answer directly, but said: \"This is a war and war has casualties.\"",
      "\"In order to preserve and protect and minimize the death toll, minimize innocent victims yet again be killed by this regime, action is needed,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi, who has tried to position himself as a transitional leader of Iran, characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world. He has claimed that chants of his name during the protests demonstrate the legitimacy of the role he could play, though it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi hasn't set foot in Iran in nearly 50 years. But asked if he was willing to die for the cause, he said yes, and pointed to the fearlessness of those on the front lines of the protests.",
      "\"How could I not possibly be prepared to die for them? To die for liberty, to die for saving our nation? I'm prepared to do that,\" he said.",

      "Pahlavi also spoke about how the current protests, which were sparked last month by the collapse of the country's currency, are different from past uprisings.",
      "\"Today, the ask is not just for reform, or for that matter, an economic demand. It is now putting an end to this regime. This is really the revolution in its true sense of the world,\" he said.",
      "Another factor is Mr. Trump being in the White House, he said. (Mr. Trump was also president during protests in Iran in 2018 and 2019, which did not result in regime change.)",

    "summary": "Mexico has become a key fuel supplier to Cuba since Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture by the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Despite President Trump's social media pronouncement Sunday that \"there will be no more oil or money going to Cuba \u2014 zero,\" the current U.S. policy is to allow Mexico to continue to provide oil to the island, according to Energy Secretary Chris Wright and another U.S. official.",
      "Cuba desperately needs the oil, since Venezuela is no longer supplying it, after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's ouster just over a week ago.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Monday morning. The White House and Mexican government have not yet said whether Mexico's oil supply to Cuba was discussed.",
      "Mexico, which was providing some oil to Cuba before Maduro's capture by the U.S., has become an especially key fuel supplier to the island since the Venezuelan leader's arrest, which was accompanied by the U.S. interception of vessels carrying oil to Cuba. Sheinbaum has referred to oil as \"humanitarian aid.\"",
      "The U.S. does not seek to trigger a collapse of the Cuban government, but rather seeks to negotiate with Havana to transition away from its authoritarian communist system, according to a U.S. official. Mr. Trump's post Sunday morning threatened Cuba, advising the island to make a deal \"before it is too late.\" It was not immediately clear what kind of deal Mr. Trump is seeking from Cuba or who would lead them. A little later, he reshared a post predicting Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be the next president of Cuba. \"Sounds good to me,\" Mr. Trump commented.",
      "The Cuban regime had a series of defiant responses to Mr. Trump's social media threats.",
      "\"As history demonstrates, relations between the U.S. and Cuba, in order to advance, must be based on International Law rather than on hostility, threats, and economic coercion,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez said on X Monday.",
      "He also denied any current talks were underway.",
      "\"There are no conversations with the U.S. government, except for technical contacts in the migration field,\" D\u00edaz-Canel said in another X post.",
      "The U.S. assesses that a total cutoff or embargo of Cuba would be a shock to Havana's already overtaxed and decrepit electrical grid, which has been suffering from rolling blackouts. Cuba's economic condition is dire \u2014 a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the regime has been so cash strapped that its leaders were reselling some Venezuelan oil to China, the New York Times first reported. This was exacerbating the ongoing energy shortage on the island even before Maduro's arrest.",
      "That economic strain on Havana intensified, now that it has lost virtually all its patrons, and Russia has been tied up in Ukraine.",
      "The regime was intricately tied to Venezuela: It recently acknowledged the deaths of at least 32 Cubans who were protecting Maduro and were killed in the U.S. raid to capture him. Until now, Cuban officials have denied that its intel and security forces provided personal protection to Maduro, even protecting him from his own people as part of the oil-for-security arrangement between the two governments.",
      "The regime in Havana is under intense strain but has had tremendous staying power to date. That appears to be behind the CIA's mixed assessment of its stability.",
      "In October, the U.S. offered humanitarian aid to Cuba, which would be delivered by local partners, rather than through the government. Cuban and U.S. officials told CBS News it still has not yet arrived.",

      "Iran's theocratic rulers are under the most intense pressure they've felt in years, as President Trump leaves the option of a U.S. military intervention on the table in the face of a fast-mounting death toll amid more than two weeks of anti-government protests across the Islamic Republic.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that Iranian officials had called him looking \"to negotiate\" after his repeated threats to intervene if authorities kill protesters. In an unusual move, meanwhile, Iran's state-controlled media aired video on Sunday showing mass casualties in and outside a morgue in a Tehran suburb.",
      "The video shared widely online shows dozens of bodies outside the morgue, which CBS News has geolocated to the southern Tehran suburb of Kahrizak. The bodies were wrapped in black bags, and people can be seen grieving and searching for their loved ones at the site.",
      "The state TV reporter says in the clip that some of those seen dead may have been involved in violence, but that \"the majority of them are ordinary people, and their families are ordinary people as well.\"",
      "Video posted by social media users on Sunday showed scenes from the same morgue, and people could be heard wailing in the background as others appeared to be looking for loved ones amid the bodies.",
      "It is unclear why Iranian authorities might have chosen to show the mass casualties, but it could be an attempt to show sympathy with the protesters and to bolster their narrative that it is more radical actors, inspired by Mr. Trump's messages of support, behind the violence, not the government.",
      "President Trump and Iranian officials have escalated their warnings over the past week, with both sides insisting they're ready for, but not seeking a military confrontation.",

      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Sunday that the president had been briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran, after Mr. Trump warned that if the regime started \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",

      "Iran did not confirm any direct outreach to the Trump administration, but speaking on Monday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested the regime had brought the protests under control - repeating the government's claim that the U.S. was to blame for the violence.",
      "The \"situation is now under total control,\" Araghchi said, according to the Reuters news agency, as Iranian state TV aired video of massive pro-government demonstrations around the country.",
      "Government-controlled broadcaster IRIB called one demonstration and funeral march an \"Iranian uprising against American-Zionist terrorism.\"",
      "In the face of Mr. Trump's repeated threats, Araghchi said Iran was \"ready for war, but also for dialogue\" with the U.S. at any time.",
      "In another indication that the regime may believe it is weathering the storm, the foreign minister said internet service would be resumed in coordination with Iran's security services, though he offered no specific timeline.",
      "Rights groups say death toll from protests could be in the thousands",
      "According to human rights groups based outside the country, which rely on contacts inside Iran, the death toll has already climbed into the hundreds.",
      "The Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said that, as of Sunday, the 15th day of protests, at least 544 people had been killed, including 483 protesters and 47 members of the security forces. HRANA said the unrest had manifested in 186 cities across all of Iran's 31 provinces.",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",

      "Chief medical officer for Dry January USA Dr. Michael Caldwell discusses the health benefits of abstaining from alcohol on \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019",
      "After a season of binging and drinking, your body may feel like it needs a break from the party.",
      "Dry January, a modern trend that challenges people to abstain from drinking for the first month of the year, has become a popular way to \"detox\" from the holidays and start the new year on a healthy note.",
      "Research has linked alcohol to a variety of health conditions, ranging from hangovers to higher cancer risk.",
      "5 POPULAR HANGOVER MYTHS THAT DON'T WORK AFTER HOLIDAY DRINKING, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "In a recent podcast episode of \"The Dr. Mark Hyman Show,\" Dr. Mark Hyman, chief medical officer of Function Health, shared how 30 days of not drinking alcohol can transform health.",
      "Hyman, based in Massachusetts, called Dry January a \"powerful way to see in real time how alcohol affects nearly every system of your body and how quickly those systems can recover.\"",
      "Dry January has become a popular way to \"detox\" from the holidays and start the new year on a healthy note. (iStock)",
      "Alcohol\u2019s toll on the brain and body",
      "Hyman acknowledged that most people drink to feel happier and more comfortable in social situations. This effect is caused by the main ingredient in alcohol, called ethanol, which can also have toxic effects.",
      "Instead of stimulating the brain, alcohol slows it down and loosens inhibitions.",
      "\"You feel more relaxed, more social, more confident, maybe you feel a little euphoric,\" Hyman said.",
      "Alcohol\u2019s effect on the brain can also lead to poorer decisions and slower reflexes, the doctor cautioned.",
      "Drinking alcohol can cause cognitive decline and brain fog, experts warn. (iStock)",
      "Drinking also impacts the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which Hyman described as \"the adult in the room,\" responsible for judgment, planning and restraint.",
      "\"It goes offline early in drinking, which explains why people feel freer or act impulsively when they drink,\" he said.",
      "Even moderate drinking can cause metabolic stress, inflammation, impaired detoxification and hormonal shifts, Hyman said, which can affect nearly every organ system in the body.",
      "POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS COULD TAKE THE EDGE OFF YOUR ALCOHOL BUZZ, STUDY FINDS",
      "Alcohol consumption has also been linked to an increased risk of cancer, metabolic dysfunction, gut microbiome disturbances and mitochondrial toxins.",
      "It can also prevent the body from falling into REM sleep, which is the deep rest recovery period when the immune system cleans out the day\u2019s toxins, according to Hyman.",
      "Alcohol can impact deep rest and mental health, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Memory loss, cognitive decline, anxiety, sleep disruption, dementia and cardiovascular disease are all known risks of long-term alcohol use, as well as liver complications like fatty liver disease.",
      "\"Bottom line, alcohol taxes every major system in your body, especially your liver, your brain, your gut, your hormones,\" Hyman said.",
      "The effects of 30 days with no alcohol",
      "The first week after your last drink, the body begins to detoxify and reset, according to Hyman. Blood sugar and cortisol stress hormones level out, and the liver begins to process a \"backlog of toxins.\" The body also re-hydrates and reenergizes.",
      "The first 30 days with no alcohol allows the body to balance itself out. (iStock)",
      "The second week, the gut and brain will begin to rebalance as hormones like serotonin and dopamine stabilize, gut inflammation drops and the microbiome begins to heal. Cravings for sugar and alcohol will wane and mental clarity returns, the doctor said.",
      "Week three is marked by further decreases in inflammation, fatty liver and blood pressure. This can be noticeable in the skin, as puffiness and redness are reduced. Mood also begins to stabilize, with lower anxiety levels.",
      "DOCTORS REVEAL WHY ALCOHOL CAUSES 'BOOZE BUTT' AND HOW TO PREVENT IT ON NEW YEAR'S",
      "In week four, the body experiences additional metabolic and immune benefits, Hyman shared, including more insulin sensitivity, which makes it easier to lose weight.",
      "\"You have a stronger immune response. You're not getting sick as much. You have better deep sleep, balanced hormones, especially cortisol and testosterone,\" he said. \"And you see a big change in energy, confidence and focus.\"",
      "Abstaining from alcohol can help restore energy, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Pinchieh Chiang, a clinician at Circle Medical in San Francisco, said Dry January isn't a \"detox,\" but it provides \"feedback\" from the body.",
      "\"It gives the body time to show people how it feels without alcohol. For many, that insight alone changes their relationship with drinking,\" she said. \"The biggest surprise isn\u2019t what people give up, it\u2019s how much better they feel.\"",
      "HIGHER STROKE RISK LINKED TO CONSUMING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, STUDY FINDS",
      "The doctor confirmed that the first few days of not drinking may feel harder than expected, sometimes causing restlessness, cravings or disrupted sleep, but Dry January can ultimately change drinking habits for the remainder of the year.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "After a full year without alcohol, Chiang noted that health improvements are more profound.",
      "\"We see sustained improvements in blood pressure, liver function and inflammation,\" she said. \"Those changes directly affect long-term heart disease and stroke risk.\"",
      "The risks of \u2018all or nothing\u2019",

      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians.",
      "One of the most noteworthy shifts in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 announced by HHS officials during a Jan. 7 press conference at the White House \u2014 is a greater emphasis on \"high-quality proteins,\" including red meat and eggs, as well as full-fat dairy.",
      "The new guidelines focus on \"real, whole, nutrient-dense foods,\" and a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods, added sugars, refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats.",
      "HEALTH EXPERTS REACT AS ANDREW HUBERMAN BACKS TRUMP ADMIN\u2019S NEW FOOD PYRAMID",
      "\"Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the press conference. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"",
      "Nick Norwitz, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained researcher known for his work in metabolic health, shared his reaction to the new guidelines.",
      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians. (realfood.gov)",
      "Despite how the new pyramid is presented, he noted, the actual guidelines for saturated fat consumption haven't changed, as they still state that, \"in general, saturated fat consumption should not exceed 10% of total daily calories.\"",
      "The intake of unprocessed whole foods rich in saturated fat, especially dairy fat, tends to be associated with improved health outcomes, according to Norwitz.",
      "RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There are, of course, nuances \u2014 but \u2018ending the war\u2019 on saturated fat seems reasonable.\"",
      "Risks vary, experts say",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol, which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
      "\"The recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10% of total calories is based on the research showing that higher rates increase LDL cholesterol and associated risks for cardiovascular disease,\" Sherry Coleman Collins, a food allergy dietitian and expert from the Atlanta metropolitan area, told Fox News Digital.",
      "One of the most noteworthy shifts in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is a greater emphasis on \"high-quality proteins\" \u2014 including red meat and eggs \u2014 as well as full-fat dairy. (iStock)",
      "Nutrition should be personalized and is dependent on multiple factors, she said, including age, gender, activity level and genetic risk factors.",
      "\"The total saturated fat an individual might safely consume is influenced by their size and total calorie needs, as well as potentially genetic differences,\" Coleman Collins said.",
      "Norwitz agreed, adding that \"the specific food source and interaction with the unique host and their broader dietary context should take the spotlight.\"",
      "Dr. Pooja Gidwani, a double board-certified doctor of internal medicine and obesity medicine in Los Angeles, pointed out that not everyone has the same \"tolerance\" for saturated fats.",
      "\"If increasing saturated fat leads to a meaningful rise in LDL cholesterol or ApoB (Apolipoprotein B, a protein found on the surface of certain cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood), that intake level is excessive for that individual, regardless of improvements in weight or glucose metrics,\" she said.",
      "TRUMP ADMIN'S NEW NUTRITION GUIDELINES TARGET ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS, EASE UP ON RED MEAT AND SATURATED FATS",
      "\"This personalized approach becomes increasingly important in midlife and beyond, when cardiovascular disease becomes the dominant driver of morbidity and mortality and when tolerance for cumulative atherogenic (artery-clogging) exposure is lower.\"",
      "For those who need to reduce LDL cholesterol or have a higher cardiovascular risk, the American Heart Association recommends an even lower amount of saturated fats \u2014 less than 6% of total daily calories.",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol. (iStock)",
      "Gidwani also cautioned that diets emphasizing saturated fat could crowd out fiber and unsaturated fats, \"both of which play independent roles in cholesterol clearance, insulin sensitivity, gut health and inflammation.\"",
      "\"Saturated fat-heavy patterns are also calorie-dense, which can quietly undermine long-term weight management if intake is not carefully regulated,\" she added.",
      "Not all saturated fats are equal, experts say",
      "The effects of saturated fat depend on what specific foods are being consumed, according to experts.",
      "\"I would recommend choosing minimally processed or unprocessed forms of foods,\" said Tanya Freirich, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"For example, in place of a hot dog \u2014 which has additives, nitrites, sodium and fillers \u2014 consuming a chicken thigh would be a much better choice.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Gidwani reiterated that the amount of processing plays a big role.",
      "\"Processed meats are consistently associated with worse cardiometabolic outcomes and represent the clearest category to limit,\" she said. \"The risk here is not only saturated fat, but also sodium load, preservatives and the broader dietary pattern they tend to accompany.\"",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" an expert told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "Unprocessed red meat, the doctor said, can fit into an overall healthy diet in smaller amounts, particularly when consumed alongside fiber-rich plants and minimally processed foods.",
      "\"However, from a longevity perspective, it should be viewed as optional rather than foundational, especially for individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk,\" she added.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "When it comes to dairy, Gidwani noted that fermented options are \"metabolically more favorable\" than butter or cream.",
      "\"However, saturated fat from dairy is still not necessary to prioritize for metabolic health or longevity,\" she said. \"Excessive reliance on dairy fat can displace healthier fat sources without offering clear long-term benefit.\"",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Overall, the doctor recommends unsaturated fat sources, including extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado and omega-3-rich fish, as primary dietary fats.",
      "\"These consistently support lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity and vascular health,\" Gidwani said. \"Saturated fat can exist within a balanced diet, but it should remain secondary rather than emphasized.\"",
      "Why the big picture matters",
      "Saturated fat is just one piece of a much wider nutrition puzzle, the experts agreed.",
      "Unprocessed red meat can fit into an overall healthy diet in smaller amounts, particularly when consumed alongside fiber-rich plants and minimally processed foods, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"Our heart health is not determined by one type of fat or one type of cholesterol, but the sum of many parts \u2014 our entire diet, our exercise habits, our stress and so much more,\" Freirich said.",
      "She recommends consulting a registered dietitian for guidance on unique dietary needs based on age, gender, activity level and medical history.",
      "\"Our heart health is not determined by one type of fat or one type of cholesterol, but the sum of many parts \u2014 our entire diet, our exercise habits, our stress and so much more,\" said an expert.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "New Jersey-based dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade, author of \"2-Day Diabetes Diet,\" added that the message should be to focus more on overall patterns.",
      "That means \"plenty of fiber-rich plants, lean protein at every meal (including those that also contain fiber, such as nuts and seeds) and a reduction in overall intake of added sugars.\"",

    "story": [
      "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: Fox News' Nate Foy and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla.,\u00a0 discuss a surge in teenage suicides related to online 'sextortion', identify the terror groups culpable and share advice for parents to keep their children safe.",
      "At first glance, the job posts look completely harmless. They promise fast money, flexible hours and paid training. No experience required. Payment comes in crypto. But these are not tutoring gigs or customer service roles. They are recruiting ads for ransomware operations.",
      "And many of the people responding are middle and high school students. Some posts openly say they prefer inexperienced workers. Others quietly prioritize young women. All of them promise big payouts for \"successful calls.\"",
      "What they leave out is the risk. Federal charges. Prison time. Permanent records. This underground ecosystem goes by a familiar name. Insiders often refer to it as \"The Com,\" short for \"The Community.\"",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Fake job ads promising fast cash and flexible hours are quietly recruiting teens into ransomware and extortion schemes, often paying in cryptocurrency to hide criminal activity. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How The Com operates behind the scenes",
      "The Com is not a single organized gang. It functions as a loose network of groups that regularly change names and members. Well-known offshoots tied to this ecosystem include Scattered Spider, Lapsus$,\u00a0ShinyHunters and related splinter crews. Some groups focus on data theft. Others specialize in\u00a0phishing or\u00a0extortion. Collaboration happens when it benefits the operation.",
      "Since 2022, these networks have targeted more than 100 major companies in the U.S. and UK. Victims include well-known brands across retail, telecom, finance, fashion and media, including companies such as T-Mobile, Nike and Instacart. The combined market value of affected companies exceeds one trillion dollars.",
      "Teenagers often take on the riskiest roles within these schemes. Phone calls, access testing and social engineering scripts typically fall to younger participants. More experienced criminals remain in the background, limiting their exposure.",
      "That structure mirrors what identity and fraud experts are seeing across the industry. Ricardo Amper, founder and CEO of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, says fake job ads are effective because they borrow trust from a familiar social contract.",
      "\"A job post feels structured, normal and safe, even when the actual behavior being requested is anything but,\" Amper said.\u00a0\"A job posting implies a real process - a role, a manager, training and a paycheck. That's exactly why it works. It lowers skepticism and makes risky requests feel like normal onboarding.\"",
      "Amper notes that what's changed is not just the scale of recruitment, but how criminals package it.\u00a0\"Serious crime is now being sold as 'work.'\"",
      "Why teens excel at social engineering attacks",
      "Teenagers bring a unique mix of skills that make them highly convincing. Fluent English and comfort with modern workplace technology help them sound legitimate. Familiarity with tools like Slack, ticketing systems and cloud platforms makes impersonation easier.",
      "According to Amper, teens don't need technical expertise to get pulled in.\u00a0\"The on-ramp is usually social, a Discord server, a DM, a 'quick gig,'\" he said.\u00a0\"It can feel like trolling culture, but the targets are real companies and the consequences are real people.\"",
      "Risk awareness is often lower. Conversations frequently take place in public chats, where tactics and mistakes are shared quickly. That visibility accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of detection and arrest.",
      "Gaming culture feeds the pipeline",
      "For many teens, it starts small. Pranks in online games turn into account takeovers. Username theft becomes crypto theft. Skills escalate. So do the stakes.",
      "Recruitment often begins in gaming spaces where fast learning and confidence are rewarded. Grooming is common. Sextortion sometimes appears. By the time real money enters the picture, legal consequences feel distant.",
      "Amper compares the progression to gaming itself.\u00a0\"These crews package crime as a ladder,\" he said.\u00a0\"Join the group, do small tasks, level up, get paid, get status.\"",
      "Why young women are being targeted",
      "Cybercrime remains male-dominated, but recruiters adapt. Young women are increasingly recruited for phone-based attacks. Some use AI tools to alter accents or tone. Others rely on stereotypes. Distress lowers suspicion faster than authority. Researchers say women often succeed because they are underestimated. That same dynamic puts them at risk inside these groups. Leadership remains overwhelmingly male. Girls often perform low-level work. Training stays minimal. Exploitation is frequent.",
      "Red flags that signal fake job scams and ransomware recruitment",
      "These warning signs show up repeatedly in cases involving teen hackers, social engineering crews and ransomware groups.",
      "Legitimate employers do not pay workers exclusively in cryptocurrency. Crypto-only pay makes transactions hard to trace and protects criminals, not workers.",
      "Promises of hundreds of dollars for a single call or quick task often point to illegal activity. Real jobs pay hourly or a salary with documentation.",
      "Criminal groups rely on private messaging apps to avoid oversight. Established companies do not recruit employees through gaming chats or encrypted DMs.",
      "Being \"trained from scratch\" by unnamed individuals is common in ransomware pipelines. These mentors disappear when arrests happen.",
      "Any job that asks teens to hide work from parents or employees to hide tasks from employers is crossing a line. Secrecy protects the recruiter, not the recruit.",
      "Amper offers a simple rule of thumb:\u00a0\"If a 'job' asks you to pretend to be someone else, obtain access, move money, or share sensitive identifiers before you've verified the employer, you're not in a hiring process. You're in a crime pipeline.\"",
      "He adds that legitimate employers collect sensitive information only after a real offer, through verified HR systems.\u00a0\"The scam version flips the order,\" he said.\u00a0\"It asks for the most sensitive details first, before anything is independently verifiable.\"",
      "Rushing decisions or creating fear lowers judgment. Social engineering depends on speed and emotional reactions.",
      "If you see more than one of these signs, pause immediately. Walking away early can prevent serious legal consequences later.",

      "Cybercrime recruiters are targeting middle and high school students for risky roles like social engineering calls, exposing them to federal charges and prison time. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Law enforcement is cracking down on teen cybercrime",
      "Since 2024, government indictments and international arrests have shown cybercriminal groups tied to The Com and Scattered Spider are under increasing scrutiny from law enforcement. In Sept. 2025, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a Department of Justice complaint\u00a0against 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, accusing him of orchestrating at least 120 ransomware and extortion attacks that brought in over $115 million in ransom payments from 47 U.S. companies and organizations, including federal court networks. Prosecutors charged Jubair with computer fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.",
      "Across the Atlantic, British authorities charged Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers for their alleged roles in a Transport for London cyberattack in 2024 that compromised travel card data and disrupted live commuter information. Both appeared in court under the U.K.'s Computer Misuse Act. Earlier law enforcement action in the U.S. included criminal charges against five Scattered Spider suspects for mass phishing campaigns that stole login credentials and millions in cryptocurrency, laying out how members of this collective staged coordinated extortion and data theft.",
      "Federal agencies are also issuing advisories about the group's social engineering techniques, noting how attackers impersonate help desks, abuse multi-factor authentication and harvest credentials to access corporate networks.",
      "Parents often learn the truth late. In many cases, the first warning comes when federal agents arrive at the door. Teens can move from online pranks to serious federal crimes without realizing where the legal line lies.",
      "How parents and teens can avoid ransomware recruitment traps",
      "This type of cybercrime thrives on silence and speed. Slowing things down protects families and futures.",
      "Parents play a critical role in spotting early warning signs, especially when online \"work\" starts happening behind closed doors or moves too fast to explain.",
      "1) Pay attention to how online \"jobs\" are communicated",
      "Ask which platforms your child uses for work conversations and who they talk to. Legitimate employers do not recruit through Telegram or Discord DMs.",
      "2) Question sudden income with no clear employer",
      "Money appearing quickly, especially in crypto, deserves scrutiny. Real jobs provide paperwork, supervisors and pay records.",
      "3) Treat secrecy as a serious warning sign",
      "If a teen is told to keep work private from parents or teachers, that is not independence. It is manipulation.",
      "4) Talk early about legal consequences online",
      "Many teens do not realize that cybercrime can lead to federal charges. Honest conversations now prevent life-changing outcomes later. Also, monitoring may feel uncomfortable. However, silence creates more risk.",
      "Teenagers with tech skills have real opportunities ahead, but knowing how to spot fake offers can mean the difference between building a career and facing serious legal trouble.",
      "1) Be skeptical of private messages offering fast money",
      "Real companies do not cold-recruit through private chats or gaming servers.",
      "2) Avoid crypto-only payment offers",
      "Being paid only in cryptocurrency is a common tactic used to hide criminal activity.",
      "3) Choose legal paths to build skills and reputation",
      "Bug bounty programs, cybersecurity clubs and internships offer real experience without risking your future. Talent opens doors. Prison closes them.",

      "What makes this trend so unsettling is how ordinary it all looks. The job ads sound harmless. The chats feel friendly. The crypto payouts seem exciting. But underneath that surface is a pipeline pulling teenagers into serious crimes with real consequences. Many kids do not realize how far they have gone until it is too late. What starts as a quick call or a side hustle can turn into federal charges and years of fallout. Cybercrime moves fast. Accountability usually shows up much later.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "Touch something hot, and your hand snaps back before you even think. That split second matters.",
      "Sensory nerves in your skin send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors. Even tiny delays can lead to broken parts or dangerous interactions.",
      "As robots move into homes, hospitals and workplaces, that lag becomes a real problem.",
      "A robotic skin designed to mimic the human nervous system",
      "Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.",

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",
      "ROBOTS LEARN 1,000 TASKS IN ONE DAY FROM A SINGLE DEMO",
      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "You'll see them on big retail sites, in influencer videos, and even recommended by friends who swear they've cut the cord for good. And to be fair, they look irresistible on paper, offering thousands of channels for a one-time payment. But security researchers are warning that some of these boxes may come with a hidden cost.",
      "In several cases, devices sold as simple media streamers appear to quietly turn your home internet connection into part of larger networks used for shady online activity. And many buyers have no idea it's happening.",

      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",

      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",

      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything.

      "Streaming boxes like SuperBox thrive on frustration. As subscriptions pile up, people look for shortcuts. But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection. Before plugging in that \"too good to be true\" box, it's worth slowing down and looking a little closer.",

    "summary": "Email scams are targeting seniors at alarming rates, threatening life savings with a single click. Discover how families can add digital guardrails today.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Email scams have become one of the fastest ways scammers steal money from older adults. A single click can expose bank accounts, personal data and retirement savings built over a lifetime. That growing risk is what prompted Bob to write to us with a question many families are now facing:",
      "\"My friend's father is 95 and absolutely lives through his phone/laptop. He refuses to give up either and often clicks on email links. A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",
      "Here is a practical plan families can actually use.",
      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",
      "Email is the number one entry point for scams targeting seniors. Strong filtering matters. Use an email provider with advanced spam protection, such as Gmail or Outlook.com. In the email settings:",
      "Turn off automatic image loadingDisable link previewsBlock or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown sendersAutomatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",

      "Disable link previews",
      "Block or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown senders",
      "Automatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",
      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "7) Set clear rules around scams and payments",
      "Technology helps, but expectations matter. Have one calm conversation and agree on simple rules:",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or textsNo sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrencyAlways call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or texts",
      "No sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrency",
      "Always call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "Post these rules near the computer or phone. Visual reminders reduce panic decisions. Also, before setting rules, choose one primary trusted contact. Multiple helpers can slow response during urgent scams and create confusion when fast decisions matter. That person should be the default call for anything urgent involving money, account access, or unexpected requests.",
      "Adult children increasingly step in to help parents spot red flags before a simple mistake turns into a financial loss. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",

      "That's exactly what happened with Andover, Massachusetts-based Covenant Health. The Catholic healthcare provider has confirmed a cyberattack discovered last May may have affected nearly 500,000 patients, a sharp increase from the fewer than 8,000 people it initially reported earlier this year.",
      "A ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the incident, though Covenant Health has not publicly confirmed the use of ransomware.

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",

The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",

For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",

      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

      "January feels like a reset. A new calendar. New goals. New habits. While you clean out your inbox, organize paperwork or set resolutions, however, scammers also hit reset, and they start with your personal data.",
      "That is because January is one of the most important months for online privacy. This is when data brokers refresh profiles and scammers rebuild their target lists.",
      "As a result, the longer your information stays online, the more complete and valuable your profile becomes. To help address this, institutions like the U.S. Department of the Treasury have released advisories urging people to stay vigilant and avoid data-related scams.",
      "For that reason, taking action early in the year can significantly reduce scam attempts, lower identity theft risks, and limit unwanted exposure for the rest of the year.",

      "Each year adds another layer. A new address. A changed phone number. A family connection. A retirement milestone. On its own, one data point doesn't mean much. But together, they create a detailed identity profile that scammers can use to convincingly impersonate you. That's why waiting makes things worse, not better.",
      "Why scammers 'rebuild' targets at the start of the year",
      "Scammers don't randomly target people. They work from lists. At the beginning of the year, those lists get refreshed.",
      "Data brokers update and resell profiles after year-end records closeNew public filings from the previous year become searchableMarketing databases reset campaigns and audience segmentsScam networks repackage data into \"fresh\" target lists.",

      "Removing your data early isn't just about stopping scams today; it's about cutting off the supply chain that fuels them. When your information is removed from data broker databases:",
      "It's harder for scammers to find accurate contact detailsPhishing messages become less convincingImpersonation attempts fail more oftenYour identity becomes less valuable to resell.",

      "This has a compounding benefit in the opposite direction. The fewer lists you appear on in January, the fewer times your data gets reused, resold, and recycled throughout the year. That's why I consistently recommend addressing data exposure before problems start, not after.",
      "Why retirees and families feel the impact first",

      "Deleting cookies",
      "Unsubscribing from emails",
      "Changing passwords",
      "Signing up for credit monitoring.",
      "Those steps help, but they don't remove your data from broker databases. Credit monitoring services alert you after something goes wrong. Password changes don't affect public profiles. And unsubscribing doesn't stop data resale. If your personal information is still sitting in hundreds of databases, scammers can find you.",
      "The January privacy reset that actually works",
      "If you want fewer scam attempts for the rest of the year, the most effective step is removing your personal data at the source.",
      "You can do this in one of two ways. You can submit removal requests yourself, or you can use a professional data removal service to handle the process for you.",
      "Manually removing your data means identifying dozens or even hundreds of data broker websites, finding their opt-out forms and submitting removal requests one by one. You also need to verify your identity, track responses and repeat the process whenever your information reappears.",
      "This approach works, but it requires time, organization, and ongoing follow-up.",
      "A data removal service handles this process on your behalf. These services typically:",

      "Because these services handle sensitive personal information, it is important to choose one that follows strict security standards and uses verified removal methods.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Scammers don't wait for mistakes. They wait for exposed data. January is when profiles are refreshed, lists are rebuilt, and targets are chosen for the year ahead. The longer your personal information stays online, the more complete-and dangerous-your digital profile becomes. The good news? You can stop the cycle. Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.",

      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",

      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls.

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/hackers-abuse-google-cloud-send-trusted-phishing-emails",
    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:40:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Cybercriminals allegedly sent 9,000+ phishing emails using Google Cloud tools, targeting 3,200 organizations by exploiting legitimate automation features.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if attackers steal your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) can stop them from accessing your account. Use app-based authentication or hardware keys when possible, especially for work email, cloud storage, and Microsoft accounts.",
      "If something feels off, report it. Flag suspicious Google or Microsoft alerts to your IT or security team so they can warn others. Early reporting can stop a phishing campaign before it spreads further inside an organization.",
      "Google phishing emails looked like routine workplace alerts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.",

      "When police in Michigan arrested Jessica Plichta live on air as she finished a TV news interview supporting Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, she became an instant protest hero, seen as a victim of the heavy hand of law enforcement.",
      "The 22-year-old from Grand Rapids was widely described in media reports as a \"preschool teacher,\" an \"anti-war activist\" and protest \"organizer.\" And while those descriptions are not wrong, they were hardly comprehensive. A Fox News Digital investigation reveals they are part of a pattern in the media in which the radical ties of leftist agitators are ignored, depriving readers of a deeper and more accurate picture of their sinister goals.",
      "A booking photo of Jessica Plichta, 22, who police arrested during a protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (Kent County Sheriff's Office)",
      "\"Preschool Teacher, 22, Arrested on TV After Condemning Trump,\" blared a headline in The Daily Beast, above an article that noted cynically, \"Welcome to America.\" The UK-based Guardian published an article framing her as a progressive \"anti-war\" activist. And Democracy Now, an anti-Trump platform, lamented, \"Grand Rapids Police Arrest Protest Antiwar Organizer After She Condemns Trump.\"",
      "Few outlets reported that Plichta is a dedicated revolutionary in the radical Freedom Road Socialist Organization, a self-described Marxist-Leninist \"organization of revolutionaries fighting for socialism in the United States.\" The FBI in 2010 investigated the group for alleged ties to terrorist groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It is part of a sprawling network of Marxist-Leninist groups funded by a China-backed billionaire and committed to sowing chaos on American streets, using issues from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Elon Musk and President Donald Trump to fan the flames of discord.",

      "The Freedom Road Socialist Organization and Plichta didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Plichta\u2019s case is one in a series in which the media glosses over \u2013 essentially red-washing \u2013 the radical ideologies of far-left people and organizations involved in protests and agitation against the Trump administration. Similarly, the media has largely described anti-ICE protester Renee Nicole Good, killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week, as a \"37-year-old mother of three\" and \"an amazing human being,\" with little scrutiny of her participation in a militant anti-ICE group called \"Minnesota ICE Watch,\" which trains members to aggressively obstruct the work of ICE officers.",
      "For the far-left, sanitizing protesters accomplishes an organizing strategy that its consultants recommend in information warfare: \"lead with sympathetic characters.\" The goal is often to disguise coordinated revolutionary activity as grassroots activism.",
      "\"It seems there is a widespread practice in the media of identifying conservatives by their political or group affiliations,\" said Walter Kirn, a veteran journalist and editor-at-large at\u00a0County Highway, a pioneering media publication. \"They're \u2018MAGA.\u2019 They're \u2018Trump supporters.\u2019 They're \u2018far right.\u2019",
      "\"Meanwhile, on the left,\" Kirn said, \"people are described sympathetically by their roles. They're \u2018moms.\u2019 They're \u2018protesters.\u2019 It's an obvious double standard that should be corrected, particularly when membership in specific activist groups is involved.\" Kirn also edits a Substack newsletter,\u00a0\"Unbound.\"",
      "In most cases, the activist groups are transparent about their work and proud of their objectives. The stated goal of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which planted its red \"FRSO\" flag on the street where Good was killed, is to subvert the U.S. The Freedom Road Socialist Organization receives 501(c)(3) nonprofit benefits through the Lucy Parsons Institute for Social Research, a small Chicago nonprofit which last reported $264,004 in revenues.",
      "Plichta\u2019s arrest on Jan. 3 came soon after she led the pro-Maduro protest through the streets of Grand Rapids, blocking intersections. Despite multiple warnings from police, the group refused to move to the sidewalk.",

Her mouth fell open, and she slowly put her hands above her head, saying, \"I am not resisting arrest. I am going peacefully.\"",
      "Local media immediately reported the story, describing Plichta simply as a \"preschool teacher\" and protester. On Monday, she complained in an interview that police put her in their cruiser \"without buckling my seatbelt.\" The interview was staged with her comrades behind her, including one carrying a signed branded \"Freedom Road Socialist Organization.\" There was no mention of Plichta's radical ideological orientation in the story.",

But to her self-described \"comrades,\" she and Freedom Road Socialist Organization were new stars in a sprawling movement, all under the International People\u2019s Assembly, an umbrella group for about 200 communist, socialist and Marxist-Leninist groups worldwide. That group has more on its agenda than stopping the Trump administration from arresting illegal immigrants or even toppling South American dictators.",

      "In recent days, these groups have been actively mobilizing socialist, communist and Marxist-Leninist members nationwide to protest U.S. \"imperialist\" policies against immigrants, Venezuela, Palestinians and a host of other issues. Even there, major news outlets are largely ignoring the role of far-left groups in organizing the protests and describing them instead with sweeping statements framed as national consensus. CNN called the protests a \"nationwide outcry,\" while the New York Times described the demonstrations as a \"mounting outrage. Neither CNN nor the New York Times described the demonstrations' openly socialist organizers, even though the New York Times published two photos of the trademark black-and-white signs of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, its name in bold letters across the signs, and it even published one photo with \"FRSO\" and \"Freedom Road Socialist Organization\" across the bottom.",
      "In its investigation of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, according to internal documents made public, the FBI launched its query in 2010 to see whether U.S. activists associated with the organization provided material support to foreign groups designated by the State Department as terrorist organizations.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \"always misread\" the prior executive order \"as a cost-cutting directive.\" In trying to \"cut his way to growth\" through the UN80 initiative, Dugan said Guterres \"meat-cleavered budgets, hitting bone and flesh as much as fat, but at base it was business as usual: no focus on the U.N.'s pitiful return on investment. Instead of only cutting the bottom line, also he should have grown the top line by working smarter for new efficiencies.\"",

      "\"For the first time in the 47 years of struggle by the Iranian people against the Islamic Republic, the idea of returning to the period before January 1979 became the sole demand and the central point of unity among the people,\" he said. \"As a result, we witnessed the most widespread presence of people from all cities and villages of Iran in the streets, on a scale unprecedented in any previous protests.\"",
      "Ghadimi claimed the chants on the streets reflected that shift. Instead of demanding economic relief or changes to dress codes, protesters openly called for the fall of the Islamic Republic and the return of the Pahlavi dynasty.",

      "Former Trump State Department deputy special envoy Ellie Cohanim explains why this moment in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term could be historic amid Iranian civil unrest on \u2018Fox Report.\u2019",
      "As Iran faces escalating nationwide protests and rising verbal threats from the Trump administration, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered a pointed warning to the United States this week from an unusual platform \u2014 his Russian-language account on X \u2014 a move analysts say underscores Tehran\u2019s alignment with Moscow as pressure mounts on the regime.",
      "In a post dated Jan. 11, Khamenei wrote in Russian, \"The United States today is miscalculating in its approach toward Iran.\" Hours later, he followed with a second message, also in Russian, warning that Americans had suffered defeat before because of \"miscalculations\" and would do so again because of \"erroneous planning.\"",
      "Ksenia Svetlova, executive director of the Regional Organization for Peace, Economy and Security (ROPES) and an associate fellow at Chatham House, said the language choice was telling, even if the execution was clumsy.",
      "PROTESTS SPREAD ACROSS IRAN AS REGIME THREATENS US FORCES AS 'LEGITIMATE TARGETS' AFTER TRUMP WARNING",
      "\"This is bad Russian,\" Svetlova told Fox News Digital. \"It seems that it\u2019s translated by Google Translate, not by a human being.\" Still, she said the use of Khamenei\u2019s Russian-language account was no surprise given how closely Iran and Russia have aligned in recent years.",
      "Khamenei\u2019s warning came as Iran\u2019s internal crisis continued to deepen. According to HRANA, a human rights organization tracking the unrest, at least 544 people have been killed in nationwide protests, with dozens of additional cases still under review. Opposition group NCRI has claimed the death toll is far higher \u2014 more than 3,000 \u2014 though exact figures remain difficult to verify amid widespread internet blackouts imposed by Iranian authorities.",
      "President Donald Trump has led U.S. criticism in response to the rising death toll. In response to a question about whether Iran had crossed a red line, Trump responded by saying, \"They're starting to, it looks like. And they seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed. These are violent. If you call them leaders, I don't know if they're leaders, or just they rule through violence. But we're looking at it very seriously,\" he said on Sunday aboard Air Force One.",

      "Iranian leaders have pushed back, accusing Washington of interference and warning that any U.S. military action would trigger retaliation against American forces and allies in the region.",

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said Monday that communication between Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff remains active.

      "Despite those overtures, analysts say Khamenei\u2019s Russian-language message reflects where Iran sees its most reliable strategic partner.",
      "Russia has become a critical lifeline for Tehran, particularly as Moscow relies on Iranian-supplied drones and other military equipment for its war in Ukraine. That dependence, Svetlova said, means Iran\u2019s internal instability could carry serious consequences for the Kremlin.",
      "\"I think that could be a dramatic effect, because they do depend on Iran \u2014 specifically military production, the drones and ballistic missiles,\" she said. \"They need them to continue their war against Ukraine.\"",
      "Yet the partnership has also fueled resentment inside Iran. Svetlova pointed to criticism following the 12-day war with Israel, when many Iranians accused Moscow of failing to come to Tehran\u2019s aid.",
      "\"There was a lot of criticism in Iran against Russia that it did not come to help,\" she said. \"It didn\u2019t reach out. It didn\u2019t do anything, basically.\"",
      "Still, she said Russia has few alternatives as its global position narrows. With longtime allies weakened or toppled, such as Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, Moscow is increasingly reliant on Tehran \u2014 even as it remains largely silent about the protests rocking Iran.",

      "His sharp-edged remarks ricocheted around social media, giving voice to the frustration and anger many around the country were feeling about the violence.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "In the days since, Frey, the 44-year-old three-term mayor, has continued to respond frequently, bluntly and often emotionally to the shooting and the Trump administration's surge of immigration agents to Minnesota through a series of TV interviews, newspaper op-eds and news conferences.",
      "It has thrust him again into the center of a contentious national debate \u2014 a position he was in more than five years ago when another Minneapolis resident, George Floyd, died at the hands of law enforcement blocks away from where Good was shot.",
      "Longtime Democratic Minneapolis lawmakers, operatives and community members have lauded Frey's leadership following the shooting, with many singling out his emotionally charged approach.",
      "\u201cJacob has really stepped up, and he\u2019s really been a leader of the city. I think he\u2019s been the emotional voice for Minneapolis since this tragedy we\u2019ve needed,\u201d said Corey Day, the former executive director of the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party. \u201cHe understands the power of his voice. He understands where the city is and he is vocalizing how we feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cLeadership is not stagnant. It\u2019s forged under pressure, and from my vantage point, I\u2019ve watched Mayor Frey grow in real time during some of the most painful chapters our city has ever faced. He has not been perfect, but I\u2019ve watched his growth, and I\u2019m proud of that growth,\u201d added PJ Hill, a Democratic businessman who owns several buildings near where Floyd was killed in 2020.",
      "Hill, who has worked with Frey on several initiatives, specifically praised him for \u201chaving compassion for the movement without endorsing chaos\u201d in the wake of Good's shooting and \u201cdemanding accountability without dehumanizing any of the ICE agents.\u201d",
      "Linea Palmisano, a Minneapolis City Council member, said her initial reaction upon hearing the mayor\u2019s choice of words following the ICE shooting was, \u201cWhoa, I wish he hadn\u2019t said that. \u2026 That was pretty forward.\u201d",
      "But Palmisano, a friend of Frey who entered the City Council with him back in 2014, also saw the merit in the approach.",
      "\u201cHis way to jump into that moment was to try to leap ahead of it, and by saying something that maybe to some people, seemed outrageous, that was his way to be able to grab a big enough microphone to push back on Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Frey has faced a series of tragedies that have grabbed national headlines since taking office in 2018. Most prominent among those events was the May 2020 murder of Floyd by Minneapolis police, an event that triggered nationwide protests.",
      "Last summer, there was the assassination of Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park, a suburb northwest of Minneapolis. Weeks later, two children were killed  and 15 others injured, as well as three adult parishioners, in a shooting at Annunciation Catholic School.",
      "The Floyd murder in particular threw Frey into the perils of crisis leadership. Many said he struggled to regain control of Minneapolis as it plunged into chaos and rioting. And he faced criticism from progressives for his refusal to commit to defunding the police.",
      "But this time around, those who\u2019ve closely watched his mayoralty see growth.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a maturity of his leadership \u2014 unfortunately, forged by fire \u2014 that we\u2019ve seen through all these tragedies, with Minneapolis being a focal point of so many of these different incidents over the years,\u201d Day said.",
      "Even some Republicans have begrudgingly given Frey credit for the way he has confronted a lengthy list of challenges.",
      "\u201cI can empathize with an elected leader being in a position of having to react to crisis. People can react in a lot of different ways. He doesn\u2019t seem to have gone crazy or anything. He\u2019s had to deal with these crises. It\u2019s seemingly one after the other, and I don\u2019t envy him for that,\u201d said Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash.",
      "Frey, a native of the Washington, D.C., suburbs and a former college and professional runner, moved to Minneapolis to practice law in 2009 after finishing law school in Philadelphia. Four years later, he won a seat on the City Council, serving just one term before being elected the city's second-youngest mayor.",
      "He's advocated for affordability measures, reproductive health care and police accountability, while drawing backlash from some on the left for vetoing a number of progressive measures passed by the City Council.",
      "Voters re-elected Frey last November over a crowded field of competitors that included state Sen. Omar Fateh, a democratic socialist. Frey has said he will not run for a fourth term, prompting some speculation that he will seek a higher office in blue-leaning Minnesota in the near future.",
      "But for the time being, he's a prominent voice in a broader debate over federal-versus-local authority amid Trump's mass deportation push.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of Good's death, Frey began demanding that ICE leave the city. After federal authorities quickly froze state and local officials out of the nascent investigation, Frey and other Minnesota Democrats called for the federal government to allow state agencies to help.",
      "In an interview Sunday with NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Frey cited a \u201cdeep mistrust\u201d of federal agencies in Minnesota \u201cbecause so many of the things that we are hearing are not true.\u201d",
      "The reaction to the shooting has largely fallen along partisan lines. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the administration say Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, was acting in self-defense, arguing she was intending to ram her vehicle into him.",
      "Local officials, including Frey, have said that Good wasn't trying to harm the ICE officer and was just attempting to leave the scene.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take my word for it. You don\u2019t need to take their word for it. Watch the video,\u201d Frey said Sunday.",
      "Some Republicans have slammed Frey for fanning the flames of a volatile situation instead of helping bring down tensions and avoid the kind of fallout that came after the Floyd murder.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson slammed Frey as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and accused him of having \u201crushed\u201d to judgment after watching the videos of the shooting.",
      "\u201cImmediately after an ICE officer was attacked, he rushed to publicly lie and incite more violence against law enforcement,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must stop smearing law enforcement and apologize for his lies.\u201d",
      "Former Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., urged Frey to \u201cbring the community together to heal.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than a mayor and a governor bringing the community together, you have them continuing to light the fuse,\u201d Coleman said during an online town hall last week after the shooting. \u201cThey\u2019re feeding the flames \u2026 it\u2019s not the way I think reasonable people should be acting in times of great difficulty.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Frey and Gov. Tim Walz are not cooperating with the administration's immigration efforts, leading to her decision to send hundreds of more federal agents to Minnesota. State officials have also sued the federal government in an effort to stop the deployment.",
      "Frey has long said the city would not cooperate with Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement efforts since they fall under federal, not local, jurisdiction. He also said the way the administration is conducting such efforts is \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t come into a city and discriminate solely on the basis of: \u201cAre you Latino? Or are you Somali?\u201d he said on \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "Frey also said that \u201cof course\u201d he bears responsibility in bringing down the temperature, while pointing out that protests in Minneapolis in response to the shooting had been peaceful.",
      "But he cast most of the blame for the ongoing tensions on federal officials.",
      "\u201cTo those that are offended, I\u2019m sorry I offended their delicate ears. But as far as who inflamed the situation, you know, I dropped an f-bomb and they killed somebody. I think the killing somebody is the inflammatory element here, not the f-bomb,\u201d he said.",
      "In another interview with NBC News on Monday, Frey pointed out that for for weeks, after ICE agents first came to Minneapolis, that \u201cwithout dropping anything close to a cuss word, we warned repeatedly, both privately and publicly, that this would happen to and it would either be a resident, a police officer or an ICE agent getting tragically hurt or killed.\u201d",
      "And he vowed to continue his approach.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening, very much feels like an invasion,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to do everything possible to stand with and up for my city.\u201d"

      "Joe Rogan compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \u201cthe Gestapo\u201d in the latest episode of his popular podcast Tuesday, openly breaking with President Donald Trump on his administration\u2019s immigration enforcement tactics.",
      "Rogan, one of the biggest podcasters in the world, had endorsed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election just days after holding a three-hour interview with him on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d The show, which has consistently retained its No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts, has more than 20.6 million subscribers on YouTube.",
      "But on Tuesday, Rogan, who has been increasingly critical of Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda in recent months, expressed concern over ICE\u2019s activities in an episode featuring Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. He said that \u201cmost people\u201d believe law enforcement should arrest criminals, but that many of the same people also believe ICE is \u201coperating illegally.\u201d",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cI can also see the point of view of the people that say, \u2018Yeah, but you don\u2019t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around snatching people up, many of which turn out to actually be U.S. citizens that just don\u2019t have their papers on them,\u2019\u201d Rogan said. \u201cAre we really going to be the Gestapo? \u2018Where\u2019s your papers?\u2019 Is that what we\u2019ve come to?\u201d",
      "Viral videos of ICE agents behaving aggressively while detaining people on streets, in public spaces and at immigration hearings have flooded social media over the past year, stoking outrage and fear in cities across the country. Reports of agents arresting legal residents and U.S. citizens, as well as of alleged abuse at detention centers, have further eroded public trust and tolerance as protests break out in areas with ICE activity.",
      "Rogan also criticized last week\u2019s fatal shooting of a woman, Renee Nicole Good, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have alleged that Good was trying to run the agent over with her car, with Noem calling it \u201can act of domestic terrorism.\u201d Those claims,  however, were thrown into question by videos and eyewitnesses.",
      "Rogan said it was \u201cvery ugly to watch someone shoot a U.S. citizen, especially a woman, in the face.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just looked horrific to me,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cI mean, when people are saying it\u2019s justifiable because the car hit him, it seemed like she was kind of turning the car away.\u201d",
      "The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Rogan is part of a circle of comedian podcasters \u2014 many of whom are not overtly political but have mass appeal with conservative-leaning audiences \u2014 that Trump courted to boost his visibility and appeal during his 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Last year, focus groups of 18-to-29-year-old Trump voters \u2014 observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago \u2014 found that a handful of voters said podcasters like Rogan helped to persuade them to vote for Trump.",
      "But in recent months, many podcasters in that circle have expressed open discontent with the administration they helped propel into office.",
      "Rogan has called ICE\u2019s deportations \u201cf---ing crazy,\u201d saying in one podcast episode that he \u201creally thought they were just going to go after the criminals.\u201d",
      "Andrew Schulz, host of the \u201cFlagrant\u201d podcast, has similarly turned on the president, saying he felt duped. Schulz, who interviewed Trump on his show ahead of the 2024 election, expressed regret for his vote within six months of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cEverything he campaigned on, I believed he wanted to do,\u201d Schulz said in a July episode. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s doing the exact opposite thing of every single f-----g thing. \u2026 I voted for none of this. He\u2019s doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.\u201d",
      "And \u201cThis Past Weekend\u201d host Theo Von, who also interviewed Trump in 2024, had declared his support for the president while attending Trump\u2019s inauguration last year. But when the official DHS X account used a clip of him to promote ICE arrests in September, Von stated that he didn\u2019t consent to be featured in the now-deleted DHS video.",
      "\u201cI know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your \u2018banger\u2019 deportation videos,\u201d Von wrote on X. \u201cWhen it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are a lot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is looking for unlikely allies as he rolls out a new agenda to try to address Americans' concerns about affordability and position Republicans for the midterm elections: progressives.",
      "On Monday, he called Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., after she delivered a speech excoriating her own party for being too cozy with its wealthy donors, according to Warren and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"I delivered this same message on affordability to him directly,\" Warren said. \"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it. I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs.\"",
      "In recent days, Trump has renewed a campaign promise to cap credit card interest rates at 10% after having failed to push it in the first year of his term, vowed to ban large investors from buying up housing, and directed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to invest $200 billion in mortgage bonds.",
      "Trump has also raised eyebrows among traditional economic conservatives by having the government take ownership stakes in some private companies, threatening to punish others for not complying with his demands and pressuring Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates \u2014 in conjunction with the investigation launched by the Justice Department into the central bank.",
      "\"These are not limited-government, free-market policies, and it's also creating a precedent for the next time a Democrat's in the White House,\" said Marc Short, who was director of White House legislative affairs and chief of staff to then-Vice President Mike Pence in Trump's first term. \"For all the Republicans and conservatives to stay quiet, how are they going to object when the next Democrat wants to exert the same power and influence over the private sector?\"",
      "For most of the first year of his second term, Trump has pursued economic policies that progressives detest: dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cutting taxes for high earners in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and allowing Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. His plan to offer homebuyers 50-year mortgages landed like a lead balloon and has been abandoned.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., expressed skepticism about Trump's embrace of some progressive policies, saying it wasn't in line with what he has done thus far.",
      "\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders posted on social media last week.",
      "Warren also said Monday that so far, Trump \"has done nothing but raise costs for families,\" and he needed to \"use his leverage and pick up the phone\" if he actually wanted to advance some of these economic policies.",
      "Trump's shift toward cost-control policies coincides with a broader effort to fight Democrats on the electoral battlefield over the issue of affordability, which helped carry them to sizable November victories in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races and the New York City mayoral election.",
      "The details of Trump's plans, some of which would require legislation, still need to be fleshed out. He will start to fill in the fine print in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday, according to a senior White House official. Trump plans to drive his affordability message and outline additional economic ideas, the official said, adding that a more comprehensive housing policy is forthcoming.",
      "The credit card rate cap and the ban on investors' buying housing stock would require Congress to act, and there's little guarantee that will happen. While the latest moves may pick up support from populists in both parties, he would be likely to face stiff opposition from business-friendly Republicans and Democrats.",
      "And yet, it is clear that some of his initiatives have at least a modicum of bipartisan backing.",
      "Trump's plan to stop large investors from buying up single-family homes \u2014 a move, he said, that would make housing more affordable for first-time buyers \u2014 echoes a yearslong push by liberal Democrats in the House and the Senate to lower home prices for consumers by targeting the same practices. Warren, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have all sponsored or co-sponsored such bills.",
      "Trump's call to limit credit card interest rates for a year, a proposal he made on the campaign trail, has sat idle in legislative form since Sanders and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced it last year. Americans have, on average, credit card interest rates of 19.65% to 21.5%, according to the Federal Reserve and other industry sources.",
      "In the case of his directive for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, Trump says the maneuver will bring mortgage rates and monthly payments down, although some industry analysts predict it would have a negligible effect on the housing market.",
      "For many Trump world insiders, his willingness to upend Republican orthodoxy in service of populism is a feature, not a bug, of his policymaking.",
      "\u201cWhile some of this stuff might seem outside of what Republicans would normally advocate for, that\u2019s Trump,\u201d a former Trump adviser said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it wins him any awards with the Chamber of Commerce types, but he absolutely does not care about stuff like that.\u201d",
      "Though many headlines of late have been devoted to Trump's foreign policy \u2014 from capturing Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to threatening hostile takeovers of Colombia, Cuba and Greenland \u2014 public polling has consistently shown that the economy is top of mind for voters heading into this year's midterm elections. Polls have also shown that Americans aren't optimistic about the economy or pleased with Trump's performance on it.",
      "Last month, an AP-NORC poll found just 31% approve of Trump\u2019s \u201chandling of the economy,\u201d a number that was at 40% shortly after he returned to office. At that time, he had just campaigned on a pledge to fix an economy he long blamed then-President Joe Biden for tanking.",
      "But he has been unable to lower stubbornly high prices and the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has also continued to creep up. That could be why he's taking bigger economic policy swings, the former Trump adviser said.",
      "The gap between how Trump views his economy and the way voters view it has led him to travel in recent weeks to states with key congressional races on the ballot \u2014 including Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2014 to talk up his economic agenda.",
      "\u201cThe entire key is getting prices down,\u201d the former Trump adviser said. \u201cIf he can do that, I think it can only help Republicans in 2026.\u201d",
      "Some on the left say Trump can't be for the working class and the wealthy elites he has surrounded himself with \u2014 from Wall Street investors to tech titans \u2014 at the same time.",
      "\"As long as you see him cozying up to those people, you know not to believe anything he says about populist economic policy, because those two things cannot exist in the same world,\" said Josh Orton, president of the progressive group Demand Justice.",
      "And this week, progressives, like many Republicans in Congress, have denounced the Trump administration's decision to investigate the Federal Reserve.",
      "Others aren't convinced that the plans will work politically or practically.",
      "Aaron Klein, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a left-of-center think tank, said Trump's embrace of the political left's policy playbook is like \"George Costanza from 'Seinfeld' logic: If everything I've done is wrong, then the opposite must be right.\"",
      "Klein, who was a Treasury Department official during Barack Obama's presidency and an aide to Democrats on the Senate banking committee, said Trump is putting his own party in the awkward position of potentially having to back policies that many of them have long opposed. Conversely, some Democrats would have to contort themselves ideologically to vote against him.",
      "\"How many members of Congress will be able to be consistent on either side?\" Klein asked.",
      "That's why Trump\u2019s focus concerns some Republicans who think his break from traditional conservative economic policy will hurt the party in the long term.",
      "\u201cFiscal conservative was how the party forged victories in the aftermath of Watergate, how it attracted voters back when the Republican brand popularity was at its lowest,\u201d said a longtime Republican operative who has represented business trade groups. \u201cWhat Trump is doing is anathema of that.\u201d"

      "The Israeli and Arab officials have suggested that President Donald Trump, who is weighing military action in Iran in response to the regime\u2019s deadly crackdown on protesters, hold back on large-scale strikes for now, with some of them preferring to wait until the regime is even more strained, the sources said. They also noted the situation in Iran is rapidly developing, with the stability of the regime potentially changing quickly in one direction or the other.",
      "The conversations, which have involved American political and military leaders, underscore the complex dynamic Trump faces as he weighs possible options for U.S. action in Iran. Trump, who was expected to hold a meeting Tuesday with his national security team to review options, has threatened Iran with U.S. military action if the regime is killing protesters.",
      "White House officials have said Trump is considering a range of possible options as protests enter their third week, including ones that don\u2019t involve military force. Members of Trump's national security team held a meeting Tuesday morning on Iran that he did not attend, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment.",
      "A White House official said in a statement, \u201cAll options are at President Trump\u2019s disposal to address the situation in Iran. The president listens to a host of opinions on any given issue, but ultimately makes the decision he feels is best.\u201d The official added that Trump \u201cmeans what he says,\u201d pointing to military action he ordered against Iran in June and earlier this month to capture the leader of Venezuela.",
      "Trump posted a message to protesters in Iran on social media Tuesday urging them to \u201cKEEP PROTESTING \u2014 TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS\u201d and telling them \u201cHELP IS ON ITS WAY.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said Monday that \u201cairstrikes would be one of the many, many options that are on the table\u201d and \u201cdiplomacy is always the first option for the president.\u201d Iran has signaled a willingness to negotiate with the Trump administration to avert strikes, but Trump posted on social media Tuesday that he\u2019d canceled all meetings with Iranian officials \u201cuntil the senseless killing of protesters STOPS.\u201d The president told reporters on Sunday that a summit between U.S. and Iranian officials was being arranged.",
      "One of the Arab officials said there is a \u201clack of enthusiasm from the neighborhood\u201d for U.S. strikes in Iran right now. Another expressed concern that \u201cany attack or escalation by Israel or the U.S. will unite Iranians\u201d and noted there was a rally-around-the-flag effect in Iran after the American and Israeli attack there in June.",
      "Israeli officials have told the Trump administration that while they fully support regime change in Iran, and U.S. efforts to facilitate it, they are concerned that outside military intervention at this moment might not finish the job that protesters have started, the current U.S. official, the former U.S. official and the person familiar with the Israeli leadership\u2019s thinking said.",
      "They said the Israelis have suggested other types of U.S. action aimed at destabilizing the regime and supporting the protesters could help further weaken the regime to the point where larger strikes could then be decisive.",
      "Those possible actions include boosting communications for Iranians around the country to circumvent the regime\u2019s internet blackout, increasing or strengthening economic sanctions, launching a cyberattack, or even taking very targeted military action against specific Iranian leaders \u2014 that could help facilitate a broader breakdown in the regime, the sources said.",
      "The protests, which were sparked by economic grievances as the rial currency crashed and inflation soared, have now morphed into one of the biggest challenges the Iranian regime has faced in the theocracy\u2019s 47-year history, as thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand the end of the ruling clergy.",
      "The demonstrations began on Dec. 28, with people taking to the streets to protest the regime and the growing economic crisis that has caused inflation and soaring prices in the country. The Iranian government cut internet access and phone service in the country last week, making it more difficult for protesters to organize and for the world outside of Iran to see what is happening there and assess the numbers of dead, wounded and imprisoned.",
      "Reports from inside Iran indicate a rising number of protesters have been killed, with many more injured or arrested, as Iranian security forces continue a bloody crackdown that\u2019s included opening fire on crowds using live ammunition. Iranian authorities have released no official numbers on deaths or injuries.",

      "The changes could be as basic as a few extra minutes of sleep per night, plus a few more vegetables or grains and a few extra minutes of exercise per day.",
      "Scientists at the University of Sydney in Australia analyzed the behaviors of more than 59,000 older adults using the UK Biobank, a massive database that began recruiting participants in 2005 and collects data about health, lifestyle and demographics.",
      "For one week, Biobank participants wore wrist devices that tracked their sleep and movements, in which moderate to vigorous physical activity counted as exercise.",
      "Based on participants\u2019 self-reported eating habits, they were awarded diet quality scores ranging from zero to 100, with a higher score indicating a healthier diet. For example, eating at least three servings of fruit per day earned the maximum 10 points in the fruit category, while refraining from sugary drinks earned the maximum 10 points in the beverage category.",

      "After a median follow-up period of just over eight years, Koemel and his colleagues looked at how many participants had died or developed medical conditions including cancer, dementia, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. They defined healthspan as additional years lived free of those diseases.",

      "\u201cThe message here should not necessarily be that making these small tweaks is a silver bullet,\u201d Koemel said. \u201cIt\u2019s more so about where we take that first step and trying to look at how we can make sustainable opportunities that are more achievable for some people.\u201d",
      "In a similar study also published Tuesday, in the journal The Lancet, researchers found that for most adults, sitting 30 fewer minutes a day was associated with a 7% decrease in deaths over an average follow-up period of eight years.",
      "What\u2019s more, an additional five minutes of moderately to vigorously intense daily exercise was linked to 10% fewer deaths, while an additional 30 minutes of light physical activity was linked to 5% fewer deaths.",
      "The second study, led by scientists at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo, involved more than 135,000 adults in the U.K., the U.S., Norway and Sweden, and it included UK Biobank data. The authors wrote that they hope their work may influence public health policies.",

      "Nearly 37% of U.S. adults don\u2019t get the recommended minimum seven hours of sleep per night, according to 2022 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Lack of sleep can cause short- and long-term mental and physical health problems, from depression and trouble focusing to heart disease and obesity. Impacts to your sleep are cumulative, said Dr. Maha Alattar, medical director of the VCU Health Center for Sleep Medicine in Richmond, Virginia.",
      "\u201cAdding five minutes may not help you that one day, but ... at the end of the month, it will add up to a lot of hours,\u201d said Alattar, who wasn\u2019t involved in either study. \u201cThat can translate to long-term better health because I look at it the other way, and that\u2019s how we look at sleep deprivation.\u201d",
      "Rather than focus on sleeping eight hours a night, Alattar said, she advises patients to add an extra 30 minutes to whatever nightly amount of sleep they\u2019ve been getting. That small change is a manageable way to help get them on the right track.",
      "In the Sydney study, sleeping more than 7.5 hours a night alone wasn\u2019t associated with increased life expectancy.",
      "Move more to live longer",
      "Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the Arizona State University College of Health Solutions, wasn\u2019t surprised by the Sydney study results. He said they back up previous research showing an association between cumulative exercise changes and increased life expectancy.",
      "\u201cThose going from zero to 10 minutes a day of walking will experience more benefit than someone who\u2019s going from 30 to 40,\u201d said Gaesser, who wasn\u2019t involved in either study. \u201cBeyond 40, you get a law of diminishing returns.\u201d",
      "The Sydney study showed that exercise benefits peaked at 50 minutes per day, meaning exercising beyond that wasn\u2019t linked to a longer lifespan.",
      "Fitness habits \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 are hard to change, Gaesser said: \u201cThe best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.\u201d Even so, the science suggests a little change goes a long way.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a mass overhaul of your lifestyle to achieve health benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "Focus on small nutritional improvements",
      "There are notable limitations to the Sydney study. The diet data was self-reported, which is known to be notoriously inaccurate, and the observational research was based on relatively brief recordings of sleep and exercise.",
      "Dr. David D\u2019Alessio, chief of the division of endocrinology, metabolism and nutrition at the Duke University School of Medicine, said, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be that precise when you take a 30,000-foot view.\u201d",
      "Sleep, exercise and diet \u201cwould need to be tested in an interventional way to be able to say little bits really do make a difference, a half a cup of vegetables does make a difference,\u201d said D\u2019Alessio, who wasn\u2019t part of either study.",
      "However, D\u2019Alessio appreciates how hard it is to change health habits. \u201cThe thing I always push is you gotta lose 5 pounds before you lose 10 pounds.\u201d"

    "summary": "What zodiac signs are the cast of The Traitors Season 4? Here's who is an Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.",
    "story": [
      "Some of our favorite reality stars, athletes, actors, and icons have come together to form the cast of Season 4 of \"The Traitors.\"",
      "The Peacock series, hosted by Alan Cumming (an Aquarius), premiered on January 8 and showcases celebrities such as Johnny Weir, Dorinda Medley, and Ron Funches, among others.",
      "Looking at the cast, it\u2019s important to note their zodiac signs to understand how they\u2019ll interact and play together. There are no Leos or Capricorns, but plenty of mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) to stir the pot. With Episodes 1 to 3 already aired, we are seeing major drama unfold.",
      "Read below to find out what zodiac sign is more likely to be a Traitor or Faithful.",
      "Aries",
      "Aries are driven to excel. Being that they are the first sign of the zodiac, they are full of bravado and gusto \u2014 so much so that the warrior sign won\u2019t stop until they peak to great heights. Aries will never allow themselves to be the sacrificial ram, making them a force to be reckoned with. They are born to conquer!",
      "Taurus",
      "Tauruses are great at gathering background information on the contestants, much like Carolyn Stanbury stated in Episode 1 of Season 4. However, that does not mean they\u2019re gossipy. The Bull likes to be in the know because it can manage the environment and be in tune with the energy that surrounds it without breaking a sweat, thereby defeating others.",
      "Gemini",
      "Geminis have a dualistic and duplicitous side to them, making them the perfect person to cause a ruckus on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201c The twin star might spill the tea, twist facts, and slip in some side eye to get their way \u2014 basically, the air sign will do anything to get their hands on the cash prize and the acclaim they crave.",
      "Cancer",
      "Cancers can be secretive at times, as their planetary ruler is the moon. Since their emotions change every few days from the lunar phases, they\u2019re tricky to read. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, which is why anyone who messes with a crab better watch out. Their pincers are no joke!",
      "Virgo",
      "Virgos are going to be methodical and authentic. Their approach to situations is based on what unfolds before their eyes. Then, they can assess and decide how they want to proceed, mindfully and cautiously. The earth sign may appear sweet and innocent, but its shadow side can be competitive and cutthroat \u2014 especially when it comes to money, acclaim and success.",
      "Libra",
      "Libras are fair-minded, meaning they will not veer from the rules unless they have to. While they put on a nice front, Libras can flirt with danger. If they are a Traitor or a Faithful, odds are that they\u2019ll be diplomatic in how they move forward on the show. Throughout the process, they\u2019ll have a smile on their faces.",
      "Scorpio",
      "Scorpio is a zodiac sign that knows how to plot and manipulate to get what they want and use information to their advantage. If anyone stands in their way, Scorpio\u2019s stingers come out. Those who are born under this sign assert their power and control situations with their authoritative and intense presence. One could say they would make the best Traitor!",
      "Sagittarius",
      "The archer is the only constellation that is both a protector and warrior \u2014 anyone who acts against them will have to watch their back. Sagittarius likes to have the last word, which means they aren\u2019t going anywhere without a fight or drama. The other contestants better beware! Lying might be hard, since they are known for their brutal honesty.",
      "Aquarius",
      "The air sign might play aloof, but they have their head in the game. Expect the Aquarian contestants to be low-key messy behind the scenes as they plot their strategy, but be nice to the faces of those who are their adversaries. They\u2019ll use their intellect and mindfulness to secure the bag. Watch out, because you\u2019ll never see them coming!",
      "Pisces",
      "Pisces is an intuitive sign that uses its sixth sense to rise above the rest. These players may have an inkling who their opponents are, but not proof. Plus, Pisces are great at deflecting energy. Their secretive nature allows them to trick others into trusting them, as they won\u2019t reveal any clues. Pisces can win based on a hunch or vibe.",

      "She was announced as the host of the 2026 awards just months after last year\u2019s ceremony.",
      "\u201cHosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,\u201d Glaser said in a statement at the time. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from \u2018The White Lotus,\u2019 who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season 4 as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.\u201d",
      "Glaser has been making people laugh ever since college, where she did stand-up. While pursing a degree in English from the University of Kansas, Glaser appeared on the show \u201cLast Comic Standing,\u201d and made it all the way to the finals before she was eliminated.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about her.",
      "She\u2019s a celebrity roast queen",
      "Glaser made the rounds across celebrity roasts, like for Rob Lowe and Alec Baldwin, before the one that blew up: Netflix\u2019s Tom Brady roast, which aired in 2024.",
      "\u201cThe roast was such a big moment for me, and my life changed overnight in terms of recognizability and people knowing who I am,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "In fact, Glaser did so well at the event that she joked the audience at the 2025 Golden Globes were \u201cscared\u201d of what she was going to say about her in the opening monologue.",
      "\u201cI think, when I first walked out (to do the opening monologue), I knew the energy was like, \u2018We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. We\u2019ve seen her do the Tom Brady roast, most recently.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of where I popped for most people,\u201d Glaser said during a conversation at the Time100 Summit on April 23.",
      "She may be famous for them, but she doesn\u2019t love roasts.",
      "\u201cWhenever I\u2019ve done a Comedy Central Roast. I\u2019ve done three of them and at the end of every single one I tell my friends to never let me do another one,\u201d she told Interview magazine.",
      "\u201cIt ruins my life for the three weeks I have to get ready for them. Not only am I such a b---- during these stints because I have to change the way my mind works in order to think of such cruel jokes, but I also exhaust myself writing and performing.\u201d",
      "What other TV shows and movies has she been in?",

      "I was probably \u2018feeling fat\u2019 that day and was jealous. Also, I\u2019ve had people say the same s--t about me being too skinny before and know how terrible it feels to hear that when you\u2019re struggling,\u201d she said on Instagram.",

      "Becket chimed in and joked, \u201cSo iconic you can\u2019t remember the film?\u201d",
      "Pratt has spoken about his close relationship with his father-in-law before. He revealed during an interview with \u201cNew York Live\u201d in 2021 that Schwarzenegger frequently quotes iconic lines from his movies when he is around his family.",
      "\u201cHe does it all the time, too. He\u2019ll say lines from his movies and stuff. He\u2019ll walk out and be like, \u2018I\u2019ll be back,\u2019\u201d he shared. The interview was part of the promotional run for Pratt\u2019s movie \u201cThe Tomorrow War,\u201d which included a scene where he said a slightly different version of that same Schwarzenegger line.",
      "\u201cI showed it in front of the whole family and I said, \u2018I do have a line. I say, I will be back,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see it just pales in comparison to anytime you\u2019ve ever delivered that iconic line. I\u2019m just saying it like a guy who\u2019s going into the room. There\u2019s nothing iconic about it.\u201d",
      "The respect between the two is mutual as Schwarzenegger proudly gushed about his son-in-law when \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d was released in 2023.",

      "Inside the Islamic Republic, authorities had cut internet access and foreign phone calls, choking off information about the government's bloody response to demonstrations initially sparked by rising prices. Hundreds have been killed in the last few days alone, activists said, with video showing bodies lined up outside a morgue near Tehran, surrounded by their loved ones crying and screaming.",
      "But Tuesday, some Iranians based abroad and The Associated Press news agency said they had received calls from inside the country. The internet remained down, and calls from outside the country were blocked, the AP said.",
      "Those who called the AP described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, with riot officers standing at major intersections, carrying batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, it said.",
      "The presence involved the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s all-volunteer Basij force, as well as plainclothes security officials, the witnesses said. Banks and government offices had been smashed and shops were open, but there was little foot traffic, they added, according to the AP.",

Iran\u2019s economy has been hobbled in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program. The protests have morphed into one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in its 47-year history.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 With the surprise capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, President Donald Trump declared U.S. authority over the entire Western Hemisphere \u2014 and warned China that it\u2019s not welcome in America\u2019s backyard.",
      "Trump administration officials have cited the need to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region as a justification for the attack on Venezuela, which counts the country as its biggest customer for oil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC News this week.",
      "Experts say China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is not likely to be dislodged from Latin America, where it has been investing and cultivating ties for more than 20 years as U.S. attention was focused elsewhere.",
      "Though the Trump administration has reportedly ordered Venezuela to sever economic ties with Beijing, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Thursday that the U.S. was \u201cnot going to cut off China\u201d from Venezuelan oil, and the country would continue to buy it, \u201cjust like the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "China is far from dependent on Venezuela for oil. While Beijing buys the majority of Venezuela\u2019s crude oil exports, they make up only a single-digit percentage of all Chinese oil purchases.",
      "Nonetheless, Beijing has strongly condemned the U.S. strike on Venezuela and its claims to the country\u2019s oil, saying, \u201cThe legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 reckless use of force against Venezuela and its demand that Venezuela dispose of its oil resources under the principle of \u2018America First\u2019 constitute bullying behavior,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s interim leader, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has welcomed the support, saying Thursday that she had met with Chinese Ambassador Lan Hu.",
      "\u201cWe value China\u2019s firm and consistent stance in strongly condemning the serious violation of international law and Venezuelan sovereignty,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a post on Telegram, according to Reuters, referring to the U.S. capture of Maduro.",
      "Though Venezuela is China\u2019s only \u201call-weather\u201d strategic partner in Latin America, the relationship had deteriorated during Maduro\u2019s 12-year rule, with bilateral trade and Chinese investment dropping off as Venezuela fell behind on billions in Chinese loan repayments and faltered on oil production.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "China also has no security commitments to Venezuela, meaning its support was mostly rhetorical as U.S. military forces massed in the months leading up to Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "Despite China\u2019s investment interests, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they would want to be part of a conflict that, from the outside, doesn\u2019t seem to involve them,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Fern\u00e1ndez Melleda, an assistant professor of Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "In the wider region, Beijing\u2019s focus has also been mostly economic, and it overtook the U.S. as South America\u2019s top trading partner in 2010. In its annual report on the Chinese military last month, the Pentagon said Beijing was expanding its influence in Latin America through \u201cinfrastructure and energy development, economic assistance, and trade.\u201d",
      "One of the splashiest projects is the Chancay port, a large deep-water port in Peru that opened in 2024 and \u201chas put South America on the map in a big way,\u201d said Carol Wise, a professor of international politics at the University of Southern California who specializes in Latin America."

    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, a push to take control of Greenland is a \u201cnational security\u201d necessity, critical to reinforcing control of the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China.",
      "For America\u2019s allies and Greenlanders themselves, however, Trump\u2019s threats to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory cut much deeper, and threaten to shatter the decades-old principle of Western defense cooperation.",
      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tightens its hold on the country.",
      "Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro\u2019s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days.",
      "No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro\u2019s capture by the United States military. The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",
      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",
      "These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas.",
      "\u201cFor many years I wished for my country\u2019s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them.",
      "\u201cA dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.\u201d",

On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn\u2019t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",

Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",
      "The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is \u201cin charge\u201d in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,\u201d James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.",

      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

      "The video, shot near Iran's capital, Tehran, shows crowds of men in black winter coats pace and search for information, some speaking urgently into their cellphones. Three women in headscarves are engaged in a heated argument that turns physical, one of them is restrained by the other two as their grief turns to anger. A fourth woman sits slumped against a wall, muttering while listlessly banging her head.",
      "NBC News geolocated the video to Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center, where rows of black body bags can be seen laid inside and outside a large warehouse. Many have been partially opened so the corpses can be identified. Bloody limbs and the faces, mainly of men, are visible.",
      "The video does not appear to have circulated before Sunday but NBC News has not been able to pinpoint when exactly it was taken.",
      "Though the Iranian regime has cut the country\u2019s internet, this vignette showing the aftermath of its deadly crackdown against demonstrators emerged online Sunday.",
      "It was not clear from the video how these people died. But according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a watchdog based in the United States, almost 600 people have been killed in the demonstrations that broke out just over two weeks ago in response to soaring prices for everyday goods. Of these, 496 were identified as protesters and 48 as security forces, HRANA said.",
      "Another human rights monitor, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights group, said on Monday that at least 694 protesters had been killed. Casualty figures vary between rights groups because the internet blackout makes it hard to speak with people in the country.",

But details are getting through, and the government has noted that clips have been sent via Starlink, Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service. Starlink terminals are known to have been smuggled into Iran during the last large round of protests in 2022 and 2023.",
      "London-based doctor Shahram Kordasti said he has been in touch with colleagues in Iran. In recent days, he said, Iranian physicians have witnessed hundreds of dead and wounded people streaming into Tehran\u2019s hospitals, as security forces maintain a constant presence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically a massive number of deaths, injured,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview. Kordasti, who is a hemato-oncologist, meaning he treats people with disorders and cancers related to the blood, also criticized a \u201clack of supply and support at the hospital\u201d and a \u201clack of communication.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of my colleagues on his way to the hospital was shot and himself injured,\u201d he said, adding that doctors he had been in contact with were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from what they had seen \u201cand they can\u2019t even talk properly.\u201d",
      "Some feel they cannot even seek medical treatment for fear of arrest by the regime\u2019s security forces, according to Kayvan Mirhadi, the chief of internal medicine at Clifton Springs Hospital near Rochester, New York.",
      "For years he has offered online medical advice to Iranian protesters among his 1.3 million Instagram followers. At the beginning of the protests, they came to him for advice on how to treat tear gas inhalation, blunt force trauma and pellet wounds, he said in a telephone interview, but that changed on Thursday when the internet went down.",
      "\u201cRather than people reaching out for advice about treating wounds you\u2019re hearing people just telling you that they\u2019re seeing protesters being killed,\u201d Mirhadi said. \u201cIt shifted after that internet blackout. The level of the violence went up.\u201d",
      "He added that he thought that over 1,000 people have been killed in Tehran since Thursday based on the information he has received. He had also heard disturbing messages from colleagues in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second largest city, he said.",
      "\u201cThey were saying 20 dead people just arrived, all were headshots. And I was like, \u2018What is going on? These are protests. Why are they doing headshots?\u2019\u201d Mirhadi said.",
      "\u201cEverybody was saying now they\u2019re using real guns, there\u2019s no more pellets,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s bullets with rifles, pistols, handguns, shotguns. And people are dying on the scene.\u201d"

      "Last year was the third-warmest in modern history, according to Copernicus, the European Union\u2019s climate change monitoring service.",
      "The conclusion came as no surprise: The past 11 years have been the 11 warmest on record, according to Copernicus data.",
      "In 2025, the average global temperature was about 1.47 degrees Celsius (2.65 Fahrenheit) higher than from 1850 to 1900 \u2014 the period scientists use as a reference point, since it precedes the industrial era in which massive amounts of carbon pollution have been pumped into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cAnnual surface air temperatures were above the average across 91% of the globe,\u201d Samantha Burgess, the strategic lead on climate for the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which operates Copernicus, said at a news conference. \u201cThe primary reason for these record temperatures is the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, dominated by the burning of fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "World leaders pledged in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels. But temperatures have neared or exceeded that mark for three consecutive years, leaving that dream all but dead.",
      "\u201cExceeding a three-year average of 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is a milestone that none of us wished to see,\u201d Mauro Facchini, head of Earth observation for the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for\u202fDefence\u202fIndustry and Space, said at the news conference. \u201cThe news is not encouraging, and the urgency of climate action has never been more important.\u201d",
      "U.S. agencies are expected to release their climate measurements for 2025 on Wednesday. NASA issues its report separately from that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, since each uses different methods to compute global annual average temperature, typically resulting in some variation in the results.",
      "However, the trajectory of all those measurements has been clear: The world is warming rapidly, dangerously and perhaps faster than scientists once expected.",
      "The climate data from Europe is grim amid aggressive U.S. efforts to scale back regulations meant to address climate change and step away from international collaboration to curb warming.",
      "The Trump administration announced last week that it would withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will leave the U.S. without a meaningful voice in global climate discussions. The administration also said the U.S. would no longer support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces the world\u2019s best reports on the pace of climate change and its effects.",
      "Later this month, following a yearlong waiting period, the U.S. will officially leave the Paris Agreement.",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and his administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. The administration is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "At the same time, it has taken steps to boost the coal industry and order coal plants to continue operating. (Coal is the fuel that produces the highest level of greenhouse gas pollution.) The administration has also pushed to reverse many of the Biden administration\u2019s climate initiatives, including subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "U.S. climate pollution rose about 2.4% in 2025, according to preliminary results from the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm that tracks U.S. emissions. That\u2019s not necessarily the result of Trump\u2019s policies, however, since many are just beginning to take effect. Rhodium researchers said relatively high natural gas prices, the growth of energy-sucking data centers and a cooler winter in the U.S. drove the increase.",
      "The Rhodium analysts still predict that the U.S. will reduce emissions in the future, largely because renewable energy sources are becoming cheaper than fossil fuels in many places. But the group now expects less of a drop in emissions than it did before Trump took office.",
      "The heat trapped by greenhouse gases is making weather more extreme, increasing the risk of intense rain, heat waves and flooding.",
      "Last year was the third-most expensive for major weather and climate disasters, according to an analysis released last week by the nonprofit organization Climate Central. In 2025, 23 weather and climate events exceeded $1 billion in damage, the report said, causing a total of 276 deaths and $115 billion in damage.",
      "While greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of rising global temperatures, natural variability can play a role. The La Ni\u00f1a pattern, in which cooler-than-average water dominates the central Pacific, tends to dampen global temperatures, while El Ni\u00f1o tends to raise them.",
      "A La Ni\u00f1a pattern took hold in late 2025, but NOAA scientists expect a transition back to neutral conditions early this year."

      "He said that \"the military is looking\" at \"some very strong options.\" And asked about Iran's threat of retaliation, he added, \"If they do that, we will hit them at levels that they\u2019ve never been hit before.\"",

    "summary": "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X over concerns that Grok had been \u201cused to create and share undressed images of people,\u201d including children.",
      "The agency, Ofcom, said it was carrying out an \u201cexpedited assessment\u201d and that X had responded to its requests for information on Friday. If Ofcom finds that X violated U.K. law, it can institute penalties ranging from sanctions of 10% of its global revenue, prohibiting British companies from advertising with X, or directing the country\u2019s internet providers to block the platform.",
      "The U.K. investigation is just one of the actions taken by governments around the world in response to Grok\u2019s deepfake abilities.",
      "Over the weekend, regulators in Indonesia and Malaysia announced they had temporarily blocked X in their countries, citing their laws against deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).",
      "Mary Anne Franks, a George Washington University law professor who studies laws on nonconsensual pornography and has helped both state and federal legislators craft laws on the topic, said she does not expect the U.S. federal government to step in. But threats from other countries with stricter CSAM laws may force X and Musk to rein Grok in, she said.",
      "\u201cIf there is some slowdown, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of the backlash, and then separately, because these other countries have different definitions of what constitutes illegal CSAM,\u201d Franks said.",
      "Last week, after being prompted by users, Grok began creating thousands of sexualized AI-generated images every hour using the faces of real people and posting them on X, according to an analysis conducted by deepfake researcher Genevieve Oh. Many of the deepfakes depicted identifiable women who were placed in bathing suits or revealing poses by artificial intelligence; but Grok also depicted some people, including some children, according to some watchdogs, as fully nude.",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told NBC News that the agency has recently observed Grok generating sexualized images of children.",
      "On Friday, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, a government agency dedicated to online safety, said it had received several reports of Grok creating exploitative images and had asked X to clarify its safeguards, noting that it could issue removal notices to X. Both Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, condemned the images on Saturday.",
      "Musk and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk and X recently posted that they prohibit users from making \u201cillegal content,\u201d but have refrained from publicly indicating that they would substantially change Grok\u2019s ability to manipulate and sexualize images of people. The creation and possession of CSAM are widely illegal around the world, but many countries also have laws restricting or prohibiting the creation of sexualized images of adult people without their consent, known as nonconsensual pornography.",
      "Early Friday, X made the Grok reply bot, which was driving the deepfake trend, a premium feature for paying subscribers, though users could still produce the deepfakes using the Grok stand-alone app in addition to other interfaces where Grok was available. While the number of such images posted to X appears to have slowed, critics like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have said the move is tantamount to making \u201csome of its users pay for the privilege of producing horrific images on the X app.\u201d",
      "Ofcom said its investigation would focus on whether X has been following U.K. law by quickly taking down illegal content as it became aware of it, and whether it was carrying out successful risk assessments before making \u201csignificant changes to their service.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a radio interview that Ofcom \u201chas our full support to take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is disgraceful. It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s not to be tolerated,\u201d he said of the image creation. \u201cX has got to get a grip of this.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MeitY, also reportedly warned X last week that it was potentially violating its laws. MeitY didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "It remains unclear if any U.S. regulators will take on Musk and his companies over the manipulated images. The Federal Trade Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department told NBC News last week that it was committed to holding \u201cindividuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable\u201d accountable but didn\u2019t mention specific companies.",
      "A number of state attorneys general have declined to comment to NBC News on whether they are considering charges over the images.",
      "Musk has broadly pushed for X and his AI company that powers Grok, xAI, to be laxer on content moderation than most of their competitors. On Friday, he posted on X that reports of the U.K.\u2019s Labour Party wanting to potentially block X over the Grok images were evidence that \u201cThey want any excuse for censorship.\u201d",
      "Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday that it has given Musk and X an ultimatum to stop the production of CSAM, but stopped short of mentioning any specific penalties.",
      "\u201cDrawing a parallel between freedom of speech and an AI tool that generates child sexual abuse material is dangerous nonsense, especially when it comes from the owner of a tech company. Frankly speaking I cannot even believe we are speaking about this and engaging with this from the commission\u2019s podium in 2026,\u201d Regnier said.",
      "In December, the European Commission fined X $140 million, saying that the platform broke Europe\u2019s laws against hate speech and misinformation. That prompted criticism from the Trump administration, with both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it an attack on American free speech."

      "On the ground, however, few things are certain, including basic questions around daily security, whether Venezuela\u2019s autocratic government will stay in place, the fate of political prisoners, who will ultimately revitalize its vast and decrepit oil industry, and whether the once rich country will ever prosper again.",
      "On Friday afternoon at an eastern Caracas social club \u2014 one of many private organizations resembling small country clubs \u2014 three mothers watched their children play and discussed whether they should send them to school on Monday when they are due to reopen after the Christmas break.",
      "Two of them said they would and a third that she didn\u2019t dare. The three, as well as other residents NBC News spoke with, asked that their names not be used for fear of reprisals.",
      "As darkness fell, one of them, a 34-year-old publicist, asked if they should get something to eat with the children.",
      "Her friend demurred.",
      "\u201cI live on the other side of the city, I better get going because the situation isn\u2019t safe enough to be out so late,\u201d the 38-year-old lawyer said.",
      "Throughout Caracas, state security forces and colectivos \u2014 groups of armed civilians who support of the Venezuelan regime \u2014 roam the streets checking people\u2019s telephones for signs of anti-government sentiments and support for the U.S. raid that resulted in Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "This is especially true in the working-class areas.",
      "\u201cHere we see a bit of everything,\u201d said a 30-year-old motorcycle taxi driver who lives in the working-class Petare neighborhood. \u201cThere are military, police and colectivos.\u201d",
      "During a Friday-night tour of the capital, powerful and feared Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello declared that the country was at peace because the state still \u201chas the monopoly and full control of weapons.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving possession of the weapons has allowed us to maintain control, so that no group can claim responsibility for acts of violence other than those perpetrated by the United States in the early morning of Jan. 3,\u201d said Cabello, who oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the colectivos.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. State Department issued an updated travel advisory urging Americans to leave Venezuela immediately now that international flights have resumed.",
      "The advisory also warned of armed militia groups setting up roadblocks and looking for evidence of U.S. citizenship or support for the United States.",
      "\u2018Uninvestable\u2019",
      "Once Latin America\u2019s richest country, Venezuela went into economic free fall during the last two decades. Nearly 8 million people have fled, creating one of the world\u2019s worst refugee crises. Some 90% of the population is deemed poor, while 50% live in extreme poverty. All this in a country that sits on the world\u2019s largest known oil reserves.",
      "While he cited a desire to stamp out groups that control Venezuela\u2019s illicit drug trade, which have seeped into the government, Trump has also repeatedly made clear his interest in the country\u2019s oil. On Wednesday he told The New York Times that the U.S. could stay in charge \u201cfor years\u201d to lead the revival of the vast energy sector.",
      "\u201cAmerican companies will have the opportunity to rebuild Venezuela\u2019s rotting energy infrastructure and eventually increase oil production to levels never, ever seen before,\u201d he said Friday at the opening of a meeting with the heads of some of the world\u2019s largest oil companies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in.\u201d",
      "His bid to entice oil majors to begin investing in Venezuela was met with polite skepticism by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods, who said Venezuela was currently \u201cuninvestable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re confident that with this administration and President Trump, working hand in hand with the Venezuelan government, that those changes can be put in place.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that he is in control in Venezuela, and his government is working well with interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was Maduro\u2019s vice president.",
      "\u201cAs you know, we\u2019re getting along very well with the administration that is there right now,\u201d he told The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re giving us everything that we feel is necessary.\u201d",
      "Despite his positive words about the regime, which is practically unchanged save Maduro\u2019s absence, in the last few days Trump has made overtures to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader who was barred from running in Venezuela\u2019s 2024 general election. A candidate who stood in her stead is widely considered to have won the vote, but Maduro claimed victory.",
      "After saying Machado did not have the support necessary to lead the country in the Jan. 3 raid\u2019s immediate aftermath, Trump on Thursday said he looked forward to meeting her next week in Washington.",
      "Venezuela without Maduro",
      "Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government\u2019s public stance on the U.S. remains contradictory.",
      "Officials announced on Friday the start of an \u201cexploratory diplomatic process\u201d with the U.S., aimed at the \u201crestoration of diplomatic missions in both countries\u201d and to address the consequences of the \u201ckidnapping\u201d of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.",
      "State media outlets broadcast programs discussing the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution, as the movement founded by Maduro\u2019s predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez is called. Footage of demonstrations against the U.S. attack and demanding the liberation of Maduro and his wife run frequently.",
      "The president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, said Thursday that the government would be releasing an \u201cimportant number\u201d of political prisoners, an announcement Trump lauded in a post Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has started the process, in a BIG WAY, of releasing their political prisoners. Thank you!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI hope those prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done. I HOPE THEY NEVER FORGET! If they do, it will not be good for them.\u201d",
      "Danieli Hern\u00e1ndez, daughter of political prisoner N\u00e9lida S\u00e1nchez, was overjoyed that her mother could be returning home. But according to human rights organizations, fewer than 15 of the country\u2019s 800 political prisoners have been released. S\u00e1nchez wasn\u2019t one of them.",
      "Now, Hern\u00e1ndez lives in a state of distress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living one day at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope her turn comes soon.\u201d",
      "The Caracas night was unusually silent Friday. During the day, businesses such as supermarkets, pharmacies, bakeries and caf\u00e9s are open, at night many bars and restaurants still keep their doors closed. The businesses that do open close early, around 7 p.m., and many residents prefer to get home before 10 p.m.",
      "This situation is not unique to Caracas.",
      "\u201cWhen I go out, I always leave my phone at home because there is still repression,\u201d says a 56-year-old who used to work for PDVSA, the country\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, and lives in the coastal city of Puerto Cabello in Carabobo state.",
      "\u201cWe have mixed feelings. We are waiting, silently, for the moment when we can celebrate,\u201d he said. \u201cHere where I live, everyone is quiet, no joy in the streets, nothing. Everyone in silence.\u201d"

      "The demonstrations, which started almost two weeks ago with economic grievances as the currency crashed and inflation soared, have now morphed into one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in its 47-year history, with thousands of people hitting the streets in large and small cities across the country to demand the ouster of the ruling clergy.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, drew a hard line in a fiery speech on Friday and said that the Islamic Republic would not back down in the face of internal protests or external pressure, a position that will likely drive the security forces to lash out even more violently against demonstrators, analysts say.",
      "\u201cRight now, we are very concerned that after the internet shutdown, the brutality will increase,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",

      "\u201cThere are still off-ramps for reconciliation for the system to avert a full-on bloody revolution,\u201d Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd we may start seeing indications and signs of that as the protests go into their third, fourth weeks. But we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d"

      "The United States has seized another tanker in its campaign to control the flow of oil to and from Venezuela.",
      "The Olina was seized overnight in the Caribbean Sea, an operation conducted by the Coast Guard and Joint Task Force Southern Spear, two U.S. officials told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. military confirmed the seizure, saying in a post on X that it was \"unwavering in its mission to defend our homeland by ending illicit activity and restoring security in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The Olina was \"another \u201cghost fleet\u201d tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a separate post. The vessel \"had departed Venezuela attempting to evade U.S. forces,\" she added.",
      "The Olina was falsely registered with Timor Leste, according to Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "It's the fifth tanker seized by the U.S. in recent weeks, and comes days after American forces in the North Atlantic took control of the Bella 1, a Russian-flagged tanker that fled the American blockade and led a weekslong chase.",
      "The U.S. also announced the seizure Wednesday of another sanctioned tanker, the Sophia, which it said was \u201cconducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin on Friday thanked Washington, saying the U.S. had agreed to release two of the Bella 1's Russian crew members, while President Donald Trump confirmed that Moscow had sent naval assets to try to protect the ship.",
      "\u201cIn response to our appeal, U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to release two Russian citizens from among the crew of the tanker Marinera, who had previously been detained by the American side during an operation in the North Atlantic,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement on Telegram.",
      "\u201cWe welcome this decision and express our gratitude to the U.S. leadership,\u201d Zakharova said.",
      "There was no immediate response to the statement from the U.S.",
      "The Bella 1 was seized in the North Atlantic on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings. The ship, suspected to be part of the so-called shadow fleet fueling Moscow's war-time economy in circumvention of international sanctions, changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "In an interview with Fox News late Thursday, Trump said that Moscow had sent a submarine and a destroyer to guard the ship, both of which \u201cleft very quickly when we arrived.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey decided not to mess around with us,\u201d Trump added.",
      "He evaded a question about whether Putin had called him following the seizure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade. The Bella 1 was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia.",
      "The Kremlin, a strong supporter of deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accused the U.S. of violating maritime law by seizing the ship."

      "Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with a new hypersonic ballistic missile, only its second use of an advanced weapon it says can travel up to 10 times the speed of sound and is unstoppable by air defenses.",
      "Though capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, the Oreshnik missile can also carry conventional warheads, as in this attack. Analysts have questioned the weapon's utility, and its deployment  appeared to be the Kremlin's latest attempt to send a threatening message to Kyiv and the West with peace talks stalled.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said early Friday that it had carried out the \u201cmassive strike\u201d against critically important targets in response to an alleged Ukrainian drone strike late last year on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The United States and others have rejected the Kremlin\u2019s claims, saying the residence was not targeted. Ukraine has dismissed it as a \u201clie\u201d intended to distract from Russia\u2019s reluctance to agree to a deal to end its nearly four-year war.",
      "The mayor of the western city of Lviv, Andriy Sadovy, said it was the first time his city was hit by a ballistic missile. \"This is a new level of threat \u2014 not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe,\" he said in a video message on Telegram.",
      "The Russian attack was conducted using long-range, high-precision weapons based on land and at sea, the defense ministry said in a statement, including the Oreshnik hypersonic missile system.",
      "The targets included facilities involved in the production of drones used in the alleged attack on Putin\u2019s residence, as well as energy infrastructure \u201csupporting the operation of Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex,\u201d the ministry said, adding that \u201cthe objectives of the strike were achieved.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny terrorist actions by the criminal Ukrainian regime will continue to be met with a response,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "In addition to the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the nationwide attack involved nearly 250 drones and dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. At least four people, including a paramedic, died in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",
      "He called for a global response, especially from the United States, \"whose signals Russia truly pays attention to.\"",
      "The strike was criticized by the leaders of Britain, France and Germany as \"escalatory and unacceptable,\" the U.K. said in a readout of a joint call.",
      "While Russia presented what it said was evidence of the alleged attack on Putin\u2019s residence on the shore of Lake Valdai in the northern Russian region of Novgorod, it failed to convince observers.",
      "Though President Donald Trump initially said he was \u201cvery angry\u201d after hearing about about the alleged attack directly from Putin, he said this week that U.S. officials had determined the residence was not targeted.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Thursday warned of \u201ca potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days.\u201d",
      "The conventionally armed version of the Oreshnik missile was previously used in late 2024, in what Putin said was a response to Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia for the first time.",
      "Putin said at the time that there were \u201cno means of intercepting\u201d the intermediate-range ballistic missile, and that Russia would continue to test it. He bragged that the Oreshnik could reach speeds of up to Mach 10, ten times the speed of sound.",
      "A Russian government portal describes Oreshnik's maximum strike range as 3,417 miles. It said the missile can deliver warheads with a total yield equivalent to 45 atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945.",
      "Putin said last month that the Oreshnik, which means \u201cHazelnut tree\u201d in Russian, had officially entered combat duty.",
      "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Russia's closest ally whose territory Russia used as a launchpad for invading Ukraine in 2022, said in December that Moscow had deployed the Oreshnik missile system to his country. He didn\u2019t say how many missiles had been deployed or give any other details."
