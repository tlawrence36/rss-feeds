      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

      "A boomer hit man is given a nightmare final assignment to train his own Gen Z replacement in Simon West\u2019s lifeless action-comedy \u201cOld Guy.\u201d",
      "Christoph Waltz\u2019s Danny Dolinski is the one at an unwelcome crossroads in the film. He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",
      "West is an action and studio system veteran behind \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and various Jason Statham vehicles. There's lots of shoot-em-up action and bullets to the head for anyone looking for that, but not much more to hang on to. \u201cOld Guy\u201d feels very of this moment in the fact that it looks good and has a good cast and yet can\u2019t seem to deliver something that\u2019s either entertaining or meaningful. But unlike so many of its peers, this one amazingly was not made by a streamer.",
      "\u201cOld Guy,\u201d a The Avenue release in limited theaters and on VOD Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage, violence, some drug use.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d"

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",

In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s too early for him to talk publicly about how much the raised profile has impacted his career, but, he teased \u201clife is changing.\u201d And if he\u2019s being completely honest, he\u2019s happiest about simply getting to spend more time with the people he made the film with.",
      "\u201cMaybe it looks like kind of stupid because you could say that \u2018man, it\u2019s awards, it\u2019s big opportunities for you, why are you talking about spend time with your friends?\u2019\u201d Borisov said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s kind of stupid, but for me, it\u2019s still important to spend this time with them together. Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come. Now we\u2019re still together and I\u2019m happy about this.\u201d",

      "NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon wants a \u201cDays of Thunder\u201d sequel and said at Daytona International Speedway that he's been in touch with the Hollywood actor about making the project come to life.",
      "\"I\u2019ve absolutely talked to Tom about it because I want him to do the project,\" Gordon said. \u201cWe want to be a part of it if it were to happen.\u201d",
      "The Hollywood Reporter reported in November that Cruise had talked to Paramount about a follow-up to his 1990 NASCAR racing film. The original was a critically panned summer blockbuster that was largely lampooned throughout the NASCAR industry for its exaggeration and overindulgence.",
      "Over the decades, the film has since become a cult favorite in NASCAR circles and is still quoted by race fans to this day.",

      "Gordon could inspired have Cruise's Cole Trickle back in the day, though the character was loosely based on the late Tim Richmond. Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, won the Daytona 500 on Sunday with team owner Rick Hendrick and driver William Byron. Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly \u2014 Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon \u2014 which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports' involvement in a sequel.",
      "\"He seems to like to tease it, so I don\u2019t know,\" Gordon said Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I feel pretty confident there\u2019s a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what we\u2019re already seeing right now.\u201d",
      "The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before \u2014 think \u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d \u201cStroker Ace,\u201d or even \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d \u2014 but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style.",
      "\u201cHard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cCameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic?\u201d",
      "NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d For every \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James' ill-fated Netflix\u2019s comedy series, \u201c The Crew.\" Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry.",
      "\u201cI am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good, right? It talks a lot about where the sport is at, where it\u2019s heading, the amazing crowd that was here all weekend, not just today, new TV partners.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

    "story": [
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

    "summary": "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
    "story": [
      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states.

      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

      "Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians  --  including 6,000 primary care doctors  --  by 2035.",
      "",
      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "",
      "In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here.",
      "",

      "",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",
      "",
      "Newberry, who served about 2,000 patients, declined to be interviewed. \"I'm just retiring!\" he said in an email, adding that \"the town has chosen unconventional ways\" of recruiting a doctor.",

      "By subsidizing office space and the use of medical equipment to attract a doctor, Havana is looking out for the needs of its residents, Wilkerson said.",
      "",
      "Without a town doctor, some of Newberry's former patients now have to travel to Tallahassee, about a 30-minute drive southeast of Havana. Others are seeing doctors in Quincy, about a 20-minute drive west.",

      "Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. \"Not everybody can get to Tallahassee to get a doctor,\" she said. \"Not everybody has transportation.\"",
      "",
      "But it remains to be seen whether rent-free office space and equipment are enough to attract a doctor to Havana. The town's recruitment campaign has drawn a lot of interest from nurse practitioners, but few primary care physicians have applied for the position.",

      "",
      "Smeltzer, the physician headhunter, said primary care physicians are in especially low supply.

      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients  --  qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "Those Valentine flowers might come with a bit more than vivid colors and a nice scent",
      "PARIS -- Those Valentine flowers might come with a bit more than vivid colors and a nice scent. France\u2019s oldest consumer group is reminding people that any imported cut flower likely also contains pesticides -- even those banned in Europe.",
      "The flower industry points to studies saying that cut flowers pose no health risk to consumers, though some advocates say there hasn't been enough study on whether the contamination could endanger florists who touch them daily.",
      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",
      "In the Netherlands \u2014 which produces roughly 60% of the global trade \u2014 a similar study came to similar conclusions.",
      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",
      "Valhor, the French inter-trade organization for horticulture, floristry and landscaping, however pointed to a study in Germany that concluded there were no risks for consumers who buy cut flowers.",
      "\u201cThe entire industry is compliant and transparent,\u201d it said. \u201cWith regard to European and particularly French flower production, the industry complies with a strict and demanding legislative and regulatory framework for the use of plant protection products.\"",
      "Valhor added that it promotes health and safety practices in the flower industry workplace to limit exposure, including the use of gloves.",
      "Pierre Lebailly, a pesticide expert at University of Caen, regrets that there have been only a small number of studies on the impact of pesticides on florists\u2019 health. Among those, a study in Belgium showed that pesticides could be absorbed through the skin when handling contaminated flowers, with a potential damaging effect on health.",
      "The Dutch branch of the Pesticide Action Network \u2014 a network of European NGOs promoting sustainable alternatives to pesticides \u2014- tested 13 bouquets of tulips, roses, and mixed bouquets in a certified laboratory. Residues of pesticides were found in all bouquets.",
      "According to PAN, Valentine\u2019s roses are typically sourced from Dutch growers with greenhouses or fields in Kenya and Ethiopia.",
      "A total of 71 different active substances were found in the bouquets, of which 28 are banned in the EU. The study found that, on average, each bouquet contained 25 toxic substances."

      "Utah students as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",
      "\u201cGuns and gun safety are the responsibility of the adult gun owner, not school children,\" Gentry said. \"We support schools sending home materials to parents outlining the importance of safe storage in keeping our families and schools safe from gun violence.\"",
      "Jaden Christensen, a volunteer with the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action, said lawmakers should instead look to grow programs that teach parents the importance of keeping firearms away from children.",
      "\u201cThe burden should always be on adults,\u201d Christensen said.",

      "The embassy issued a strongly worded statement about Pakistan\u2019s plans, saying Afghan nationals in the capital, Islamabad, and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders from the police to leave the twin cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThis process of detaining Afghans, which began without any formal announcement, has not been officially communicated to the Embassy of Afghanistan in Islamabad through any formal correspondence,\u201d it said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, officials from Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future,\u201d the embassy said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government on the embassy statement.",
      "The latest development follows Pakistan\u2019s threat to deport Afghans living in the country illegally. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a deadline of March 31 to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments who have agreed to take them.",
      "The Afghan embassy criticized \"the short timeframe\" given and \"the unilateral nature of Pakistan\u2019s decision\u201d.",

Pakistan says those who were registered earlier had their stay extended until June 2025, and will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires.",

So, for us, the Afghans who are here, awaiting resettlement, also has to be a transitory phase. This is not a permanent thing.\u201d",
      "He said Pakistan has been collaborating with Western countries to expedite the resettlement program and \u201cwill continue to do that.\u201d",
      "In the past three years, tens of thousands of Afghans have fled to Pakistan. Many of them were approved for resettlement in the U.S. through a program that helps people at risk because of their work during the war with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. However, after U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. refugee programs last month, around 20,000 Afghans are now in limbo in Pakistan.",
      "They have been facing harassment and arrest since October 2023, when Pakistan began cracking down on foreigners living in the country illegally.",
      "Although the government said the campaign was not aimed at Afghans, they make up the majority of foreigners in Pakistan.",

      "The IOM this week said Afghans were being deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It said there was a 13% increase in Afghans returning home from Jan. 16 to 31 compared to the first two weeks in January. It said 824,568 Afghans have returned home since 2023.",
      "Ahmad Shah, a member of an Afghan advocacy group, urged Pakistan on Wednesday to allow Afghans waiting for relocation to continue living in Islamabad at least until the Trump administration makes a final decision about their fate.",

      "The government of Ecuador has taken another step in its effort to gain help from foreign military forces to combat drug cartels and various organized crime groups",
      "QUITO, Ecuador -- QUITO, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on Wednesday took another step in his effort to enlist foreign military assistance to combat the drug cartels and organized crime groups that have been behind the escalation in violent crime over the past four years.",
      "Noboa, according to a statement from the communications secretariat, ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \u201callied nations\u201d that would allow \u201cthe incorporation of special forces\u201d on a temporary basis as support for the Ecuadorian police and armed forces. He also urged the opposition-controlled National Assembly to back his initiative.",
      "The statement did not say which countries Ecuador would seek military assistance from.",
      "The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set down roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs.",
      "Under Noboa\u2019s watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. But the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and the country is already on track to exceed that number this year. January was Ecuador\u2019s deadliest month on record, with 731 homicides.",
      "The conservative Noboa earlier this month won one of two spots in an April runoff election.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement comes months after he asked Ecuador\u2019s Constitutional Court to clear a partial constitutional reform that would allow the installation of foreign military bases in the country. The court ruled in favor of his initiative, which now must be debated twice by the National Assembly and, if approved, ratified in a referendum.",
      "The U.S. military for a decade operated a base in Ecuador that was mainly focused on anti-narcotic operations. But that stopped in 2009, when then-President Rafael Correa ended an agreement with the U.S. citing sovereignty issues.",
      "Security expert Mario Pazmi\u00f1o told The Associated Press he believes that the government\u2019s proposal does not seek foreign troops for combat, but instead, for help with intelligence gathering and support of ports and maritime interdictions.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- President Donald Trump this week falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives, causing outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military.",
      "Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201c a dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia's own narrative of the conflict.",
      "Here's a look at some of Trump's statements:",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cYou\u2019ve been there for three years. You should have ended it ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Russia\u2019s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO.",
      "But Russia's aggression against Ukraine didn't start then. In 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin saw signs that Ukraine was pulling away from Russia's sphere of influence, seeking alliances with western European nations.",
      "Putin illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula and started an armed aggression in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas that grew into a long-running conflict that left thousands dead.",
      "That conflict simmered until 2022, when Putin ordered what he called military exercises along Ukraine's borders. He told the world that the roughly 150,000 soldiers that he had amassed would not be used to invade Ukraine. But in the early hours of Feb. 24, Russia launched widespread airstrikes and soldiers began pouring over the border.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cWe have a situation where we haven\u2019t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,\u201d Trump said in Mar-a-Lago, adding on Wednesday in a post on social media: \u201cA Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. But Ukrainian law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so Zelenskyy has remained in office. He has said he believes elections will be held in Ukraine after martial law is lifted. The country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote.",
      "There are numerous factors that, according to Ukraine\u2019s government, \u201cwould render it literally impossible to ensure a fair electoral process in the circumstances of a total war.\u201d",
      "According to the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, some 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022. Of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote.",
      "Furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they struggle to contain Russian advances. An election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening Ukraine\u2019s military position. Additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by Ukrainian law.",
      "Many Ukrainians are living in areas under Russian occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process. And since Russia continues to regularly strike both military and civilian targets across the country, packing millions of citizens into crowded polling places could create additional danger.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cThe leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he\u2019s down at 4% approval rating.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Zelenskyy \u201cretains a fairly high level of public trust\u201d \u2014 about 57 percent - according to a report released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institution of Sociology, whose executive director is Anton Hrushetskyi.",
      "Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said the number given by Trump, for which the president cited no sources, was \u201cdisinformation\u201d that originated in Russia, and that the president \"unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he will ask pollsters in the coming weeks to conduct surveys on the public's trust in him and share the results with the Trump administration.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cWhen you see what\u2019s taken place in Ukraine with millions of people killed, including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground, I don\u2019t know how anybody even lives there.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: No estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions.",
      "While exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, Zelenskyy said earlier this month that over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022. He has also said that \u201ctens of thousands of civilians\u201d had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. The most recent data from the Russian Defense Ministry, published in January 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 military deaths, although reports from U.S. and U.K. officials put that number significantly higher."

    "summary": "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled home following recent Israeli military operations across the northern West Bank",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled home following recent Israeli military operations across the northern West Bank",
      "FAR'A REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank -- By car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers\u2019 sight lines, tens of thousands of Palestinians in recent weeks have fled Israeli military operations across the northern West Bank \u2014 the largest displacement in the occupied territory since the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21 \u2014 just two days after its ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza \u2014 Israeli forces descended on the restive city of Jenin, as they have dozens of times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "But unlike past operations, Israeli forces then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, including Tulkarem, Far\u2019a and Nur Shams, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation.",
      "During that war, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel. That Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d as Palestinians call it, gave rise to the crowded West Bank towns now under assault and still known as refugee camps.",
      "\u201cThis is our nakba,\u201d said Abed Sabagh, 53, who bundled his seven children into the car on Feb. 9 as sound bombs blared in Nur Shams camp, where he was born to parents who fled the 1948 war.",
      "Humanitarian officials say they haven\u2019t seen such displacement in the West Bank since the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel captured the territory west of the Jordan River, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, displacing another 300,000 Palestinians.",
      "\u201cThis is unprecedented. When you add to this the destruction of infrastructure, we\u2019re reaching a point where the camps are becoming uninhabitable,\" said Roland Friedrich, director of West Bank affairs for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency. More than 40,100 Palestinians have fled their homes in the ongoing military operation, according to the agency.",
      "Experts say that Israel's tactics in the West Bank are becoming almost indistinguishable from those deployed in Gaza. Already, President Donald Trump's plan for the mass transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza has emboldened Israel's far-right to renew calls for annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"The idea of \u2018cleansing\u2019 the land of Palestinians is more popular today than ever before,\" said Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Britain\u2019s Open University.",
      "The Israeli army denies issuing evacuation orders in the West Bank. It said troops secure passages for those wanting to leave on their own accord.",
      "Over a dozen displaced Palestinians interviewed in the last week said they did not flee their homes out of fear, but on the orders of Israeli security forces. Associated Press journalists in the Nur Shams camp also heard Israeli soldiers shouting through mosque megaphones, ordering people to leave.",
      "Some displaced families said soldiers were polite, knocking on doors and assuring them they could return when the army left. Others said they were ruthless, ransacking rooms, waving rifles and hustling residents out of their homes despite pleas for more time.",
      "\u201cI was sobbing, asking them, \u2018Why do you want me to leave my house?\u2019 My baby is upstairs, just let me get my baby please,\u2019\u201d Ayat Abdullah, 30, recalled from a shelter for displaced people in the village of Kafr al-Labd. \u201cThey gave us seven minutes. I brought my children, thank God. Nothing else.\"",
      "Told to make their own way, Abdullah trudged 10 kilometers (six miles) on a path lighted only by the glow from her phone as rain turned the ground to mud. She said she clutched her children tight, braving possible snipers that had killed a 23-year-old pregnant woman just hours earlier on Feb. 9.",
      "Her 5-year-old son, Nidal, interrupted her story, pursing his lips together to make a loud buzzing sound.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re right, my love,\" she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the sound the drones made when we left home.\u201d",
      "In the nearby town of Anabta, volunteers moved in and out of mosques and government buildings that have become makeshift shelters \u2014 delivering donated blankets, serving bitter coffee, distributing boiled eggs for breakfast and whipping up vats of rice and chicken for dinner.",
      "Residents have opened their homes to families fleeing Nur Shams and Tulkarem.",
      "\u201cThis is our duty in the current security situation,\u201d said Thabet A\u2019mar, the mayor of Anabta.",
      "But he stressed that the town\u2019s welcoming hand should not be mistaken for anything more.",
      "\u201cWe insist that their displacement is temporary,\u201d he said.",
      "When the invasion started on Feb. 2, Israeli bulldozers ruptured underground pipes. Taps ran dry. Sewage gushed. Internet service was shut off. Schools closed. Food supplies dwindled. Explosions echoed.",
      "Ahmad Sobuh could understand how his neighbors chose to flee the Far\u2019a refugee camp during Israel's 10-day incursion. But he scavenged rainwater to drink and hunkered down in his home, swearing to himself, his family and the Israeli soldiers knocking at his door that he would stay.",
      "The soldiers advised against that, informing Sobuh's family on Feb. 11 that, because a room had raised suspicion for containing security cameras and an object resembling a weapon, they would blow up the second floor.",
      "The surveillance cameras, which Israeli soldiers argued could be exploited by Palestinian militants, were not unusual in the volatile neighborhood, Sobuh said, as families can observe street battles and Israeli army operations from inside.",
      "But the second claim sent him clambering upstairs, where he found his nephew\u2019s water pipe, shaped like a rifle.",
      "Hours later, the explosion left his nephew's room naked to the wind and shattered most others. It was too dangerous to stay.",
      "\u201cThey are doing everything they can to push us out,\u201d he said of Israel's military, which, according to the U.N. agency for refugees, has demolished hundreds of homes across the four camps this year.",
      "The Israeli army has described its ongoing campaign as a crucial counterterrorism effort to prevent attacks like Oct. 7, and said steps were taken to mitigate the impact on civilians.",
      "The first thing Doha Abu Dgehish noticed about her family's five-story home 10 days after Israeli troops forced them to leave, she said, was the smell.",
      "Venturing inside as Israeli troops withdrew from Far'a camp, she found rotten food and toilets piled with excrement. Pet parakeets had vanished from their cages. Pages of the Quran had been defaced with graphic drawings. Israeli forces had apparently used explosives to blow every door off its hinges, even though none had been locked.",
      "Rama, her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, screamed upon finding her doll\u2019s skirt torn and its face covered with more graphic drawings.",
      "AP journalists visited the Abu Dgehish home on Feb. 12, hours after their return.",
      "Nearly two dozen Palestinians interviewed across the four West Bank refugee camps this month described army units taking over civilian homes to use as a dormitories, storerooms or lookout points. The Abu Dgehish family accused Israeli soldiers of vandalizing their home, as did multiple families in Far\u2019a.",
      "The Israeli army blamed militants for embedding themselves in civilian infrastructure. Soldiers may be \u201crequired to operate from civilian homes for varying periods,\" it said, adding that the destruction of civilian property was a violation of the military's rules and does not conform to its values.",
      "It said \u201cany exceptional incidents that raise concerns regarding a deviation from these orders\u201d are \u201cthoroughly addressed,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "For Abu Dgehish, the mess was emblematic of the emotional whiplash of return. No one knows when they\u2019ll have to flee again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like they want us to feel that we\u2019re never safe,\u201d she said. \u201dThat we have no control.\u201d",

      "The move comes with the Europeans sidelined from U.S.-led talks to end the war.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022. More than 2,300 officials and entities \u2013 usually government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",

      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",

      "What Putin dubbed the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, entire cities have been reduced to smoldering ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West.",
      "Now as senior Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping it out of NATO.",

More humiliating setbacks came in September and October 2022, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russia to pull back from large parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Kherson region in the south.",
      "Fortunes changed in 2023 when a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south failed to cut Russia's land route to the Crimea Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.",
      "Russia seized the combat initiative last year with offensives along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front, making slow but persistent gains. In the fall, Russian forces captured the most territory since the opening of the war.",
      "Moscow also pummeled Ukrainian infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power generating capacity.",
      "Ukraine struck back in August with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region to try to distract Moscow's forces in the east and gain more leverage in potential peace talks. Ukraine still holds some of those gains, but its limited resources are stretched, making it difficult to defend strongholds in the east.",
      "While Zelenskyy earlier demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied areas as a precondition for talks, he later acknowledged Kyiv can\u2019t immediately reclaim all its territory. He said Ukraine won't abandon its goal of joining NATO \u2014 even though Trump dismissed that as \u201cimpractical\u201d \u2014 and Zelenskyy emphasized needing reliable Western security guarantees and a robust European peacekeeping force to prevent Russian attacks.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin and ensuing Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia shattered the Biden administration's \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d policy. Trump blamed Kyiv for failing to make a deal with Moscow that could have prevented the war, praised Russia's military might and even suggested that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine won\u2019t accept any deal negotiated without Kyiv and insisted that European allies must participate in peace talks. He dismissed a U.S.-proposed draft agreement that would give Washington a large share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as too focused on U.S. interests and had no security guarantees for Kyiv.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach stunned European allies, whose shock deepened when Vice President JD Vance sharply rebuked them at the Munich security conference over free speech and migration.",
      "While the Trump administration said European allies weren't welcome at the peace talks, it encouraged them to provide security guarantees for Kyiv in what former British ambassador Nigel Gould-Davies called a contradictory approach.",
      "Washington \"has signaled that the U.S. alone will negotiate an end to the war but also that Europe alone must pay for and enforce an outcome it has not played a role in deciding,\u201d said Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Putin's key goals remain much the same \u2014 that Ukraine renounce joining NATO and enforce the use of the Russian language to keep the country in Moscow's orbit \u2014 but now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.",
      "He said a peace agreement could be broadly based on a draft negotiated early in the war that obliged Ukraine to declare neutrality, scale down its military and protect Russian language and culture. Those talks collapsed in April 2022 with no deal.",
      "Putin ruled out a truce, arguing it would benefit Kyiv. But some Kremlin-watchers believe he could accept it if Kyiv agrees to hold elections after a ceasefire.",
      "Trump echoed Putin's line that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, needs to face voters, while Kyiv maintains elections are impossible to hold amid a war. Trump escalated that notion Wednesday by posting on social media that Zelenskyy was \u201ca Dictator without Elections.\u201d",
      "Putin could hope an election would weaken Zelenskyy and lead to political instability, said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "\u201cIn his view, most potential outcomes would be advantageous for Moscow \u2014 whether through heightened political infighting, possible protests, or a fragile victory for a new president,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Jack Watling of London's Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine faces \u201ca politically divisive election, economic paralysis due to a lack of foreign direct investment, and coercive threats from Russia to restart the war\u201d after a truce.",
      "It's unclear who would monitor any potential ceasefire.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO should play no role and that any European troops taking part should not be covered by NATO\u2019s charter obliging allies to aid of any member under attack -\u2013 conditions that could dampen European enthusiasm about the mission.",
      "While the U.K. and others signal readiness to deploy troops for such a mission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia that Moscow won't accept troops from any NATO members in a peacekeeping force.",
      "Some reports suggested Chinese or Brazilian troops as part of a monitoring force, but those countries haven\u2019t signaled any intention of participation.",

      "\u201cPutin has repeatedly made it clear that he believes Russia can achieve its goals in Ukraine without any U.S.-brokered deal,\u201d Stanovaya noted. \u201cAs far as he is concerned, Moscow simply needs to wait until Ukraine falls apart of its own accord, after which the Russian army will crush any remaining resistance among the Ukrainian army.\u201d",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya\u2019s foreign ministry said Wednesday it is ready to support peace efforts in Sudan, a day after Khartoum accused Kenya of violating its sovereignty by hosting a meeting of Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Force, RSF, in the capital, Nairobi.",

      "The United States government is formally designating eight Latin American organized crime groups that also operate in the U_S_ to be \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The United States government is formally designating eight Latin American organized crime groups that also operate in the U.S. to be \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d They are involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and extend their territory through violence.",
      "The Trump administration is applying a \u201cterrorist\u201d designation that\u2019s normally reserved for groups like the Islamic State group or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels. The aim is to increase pressure on the groups and anyone who the U.S. sees as aiding them. The designation will be published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register, according to a notice Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the eight Latin American drug cartels labeled as foreign terrorist organizations:",
      "The Sinaloa Cartel, through various incarnations, is Mexico\u2019s oldest criminal group \u2013 dating to the 1970s. It is a criminal conglomerate, an umbrella of sorts for various groups, based in the mountains of the state by the same name in northwest Mexico. It holds firm control of the western portion of the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Sinaloa moves all sorts of drugs across continents using boats, planes, migrants and cross-border tunnels. It\u2019s considered the most corrupting criminal organization in Mexico. A former security chief was convicted of helping them.",
      "One of their most lucrative businesses in recent years has been the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S. Sinaloa imports the precursor chemicals from China, produces the drug and smuggles it across the border.",
      "The arrest of Sinaloa\u2019s eldest leader, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada in July set off months of internal jockeying for power between Zambada loyalists and sons of the cartel\u2019s best known former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, already serving a life sentence in the U.S.",
      "The gruesome discovery of some thirty dismembered bodies dumped in the hotel zone of Veracruz in 2011 announced the arrival of the \u201cZeta Killers,\u201d who soon established themselves as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a hyper-violent and fast-growing group that spread through sort of franchise agreements with local gangs.",
      "Jalisco, named for a west-central Mexican state where it\u2019s based, has aggressively attacked Mexican authorities, including military helicopters, using explosive-dropping drones and improvised explosive devices. It even attempted a spectacular assassination of the then-Mexico City police chief \u2014 now Mexico\u2019s security director \u2014 in the heart of the capital.",
      "Led by Nemesio \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Jalisco distributes tons of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl in all 50 states.",
      "Both the Gulf Cartel and Northeast Cartel operate along the eastern end of the U.S.-Mexico border, moving drugs, immigrants, guns and money in what is the most direct route to the U.S. from Central and South America.",
      "The Gulf Cartel has a long history in Mexico, but has fractured in recent years spurring frequent clashes between factions.",
      "Its former leader, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n (now imprisoned in Mexico after serving a sentence in the U.S.), recruited members of Mexico's military in the late 1990s to form a fearsome element known as the Zetas that eventually split and became their own drug trafficking organization.",
      "The Northeast Cartel is a remnant of the Zetas.",
      "The Northeast cartel has retained a relatively small portion of what the Zetas once ruled through relentless violence. Their base is Nuevo Laredo, the busiest commercial port on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "These local organized crime groups, operating in west-central Mexico, produce synthetic drugs, but they are a concern to the U.S. because of something else: avocados.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo points out that the state of Michoacan exports $2.8 billion of avocados, a trade threatened by local criminal groups. U.S. inspectors working in Michoacan checking for pests have been threatened on multiple occasions by these groups, which control production and, to an extent, the price of avocados through extortion and threats to growers.",
      "This organized crime group emerged from a prison in central Venezuela more than a decade ago. In recent years, it has spread from Chile to the United States, capitalizing on the exodus of some 8 million Venezuelans escaping their country\u2019s political and economic crises.",
      "While its origins are in drug trafficking, its main businesses are migrant smuggling, human trafficking, sexual exploitation and forced labor. It\u2019s known for extreme violence \u2014 decapitations and burying victims alive \u2014 that has generated panic in countries across the hemisphere.",
      "U.S. authorities say Tren de Aragua insinuated itself into criminal networks in South America, launders its proceeds through crypto currencies and now poses a threat in various U.S. cities. Trump and his allies have seized on the gang\u2019s presence and made it the face of the alleged threat posed by undocumented immigrants.",
      "Also known as MS-13, this violent street gang was one that Trump seized on during his first presidency as the threat posed by immigration, much like he\u2019s using Tren de Aragua now. What he failed to mention was that it originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s in communities made up largely of refugees from El Salvador\u2019s civil war and other immigrants, but grew to include many U.S. citizens in its ranks.",
      "In the U.S. the gang is known for brutal violence and street-level drug drug sales.",
      "Deported Salvadorans spread the gang to El Salvador where it quickly grew, corrupting and overwhelming local authorities. The gang and its rivals controlled swaths of territory, forcibly recruiting and extorting residents.",
      "The gang has been severely weakened in El Salvador since President Nayib Bukele launched an all-out assault on it and other street gangs nearly three years ago. His administration has arrested more than 80,000 people during that time for alleged gang ties, though civil rights groups say there has been little due process.",

      "The Wakayama District Court said in the ruling that Kimura was aware of the potential for a fatality in his attack, according to the Kyodo News agency. The ruling said the attack at an election campaign event was a serious challenge to democracy and posed a significant danger to many people, Kyodo said.",
      "Kimura, at an opening session of the trial in early February, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, saying he didn\u2019t intend to kill Kishida. He said he was dissatisfied with Japan\u2019s election system and that he only wanted to get public attention by targeting a famous politician.",
      "The then-prime minister was unhurt, but two people sustained minor injuries. Kimura was arrested on the spot.",
      "The attack came about a year after the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a campaign speech in Nara, another city in western Japan.",
      "Prosecutors said Kimura had a murder intent, noting that the bomb Kimura threw at Kishida was potentially lethal, and demanded a 15-year prison term.",
      "Gun-related crime is rare in Japan because of strict gun control laws, but there has been a series of high-profile knifings and other attacks using homemade guns and explosives.",

      "Ugandan opposition figure Kizza Besigye appeared briefly in a civilian court as attorneys tried to secure his freedom, but a judge said he was too unwell to follow proceedings",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan opposition figure Kizza Besigye appeared briefly in a civilian court Wednesday as attorneys tried to secure his freedom, but a judge said he was too unwell to follow proceedings.",
      "A visibly frail Besigye, who has been detained since November, was driven back to a maximum-security prison in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.",
      "Besigye\u2019s continued detention is attracting more attention as his supporters, activists and others warn that he needs medical care and should be removed from prison conditions. They say any harm to him while in custody could trigger deadly unrest in this east African country.",
      "His family says he has begun a hunger strike to protest his continued detention after Uganda\u2019s Supreme Court ruled last month that military tribunals cannot try civilians. Besigye\u2019s attorneys say he and others who faced charges before the court-martial should have been released immediately. Justice officials say they are studying the evidence against Besigye in order to charge him in a civilian court.",
      "Besigye, a four-time presidential candidate, is a prominent opposition figure in Uganda. For years he was the most serious challenger to President Yoweri Museveni, who has held power since 1986, before the recent rise of the opposition figure known as Bobi Wine.",
      "Besigye went missing in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Nov. 16. Days later, he appeared in a cage before a military tribunal in Kampala, charged with offenses concerning a threat to national security. He was later charged before the same tribunal with treachery, an offense under military law that carries the death penalty.",
      "The Commonwealth group of nations, of which Uganda is a member, has urged Ugandan authorities to free Besigye and his co-accused, an assistant named Obeid Lutale. They are \u201cimproperly detained,\u201d the group said in a statement.",
      "\u201cTheir continued detention raises serious questions about Uganda\u2019s commitment to upholding the rule of law, key tenets of our shared Commonwealth Charter and values,\u201d it said.",
      "Amnesty International also called for Besigye\u2019s release, saying his \u201cabduction clearly violated international human rights law and the process of extradition with its requisite fair trial protections.\u201d",
      "But the president suggested authorities were unlikely to free Besigye without putting him on trial, saying in a statement that his rival must answer for \u201cthe very serious offenses he is alleged to have been planning.\u201d",
      "Museveni rejected calls by some for forgiveness and instead urged \u201ca quick trial so that facts come out.\u201d",
      "Military prosecutors accuse Besigye of soliciting weapons in meetings in Europe with the purpose of undermining national security. The charges have not been substantiated, but the president\u2019s son, army commander Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has alleged that Besigye plotted to assassinate Museveni.",
      "\u201cBut all of you remember. Besigye wanted to kill my father,\u201d Gen. Kainerugaba said in a post on the social platform X, charging that Besigye deserved to be hanged.",
      "Besigye\u2019s wife, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima, says her husband is being framed. His attorney says the charges are politically motivated.",
      "Besigye\u2019s case is being watched closely by Ugandans anxious over political maneuvers ahead of presidential elections next year. Although Museveni is expected to seek re-election, some observers believe he may step aside in favor of Kainerugaba in a bloodless coup.",
      "Many expect an unpredictable political transition because Museveni has no obvious successor within the ranks of the ruling National Resistance Movement party.",
      "Besigye, a qualified physician who retired from Uganda\u2019s military at the rank of colonel, is a former president of the Forum for Democratic Change party, for many years Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition group. He is a fierce critic of Museveni, for whom he once served as a military assistant and personal doctor.",
      "Uganda has never witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence from colonial rule six decades ago."

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has visited Pope Francis in the hospital and says he\u2019s \u201calert and responsive\u201d and full of good humor despite his pneumonia",
      "ROME -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni visited Pope Francis in the hospital on Wednesday and said he\u2019s \u201calert and responsive\u201d and full of good humor despite his pneumonia.",
      "In a statement issued by her office, Meloni said: \u201dWe joked around as always. He has not lost his proverbial sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Her visit marked the first confirmed outside visitor known to have called on the pope, beyond his secretaries and medical team, since his hospitalization Friday.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Pope Francis slept well, got out of bed and ate breakfast Wednesday, the Vatican said, after tests confirmed the 88-year-old pontiff had developed pneumonia in both lungs in a further complication that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection.",
      "In an early update Wednesday, the Vatican said Francis spent his fifth night in Rome's Gemelli hospital peacefully. \u201cHe had a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d spokesman Matteo Bruni said.",
      "The pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, was in good spirits and grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Bruni said.",
      "On Wednesday, Francis' vicar for Rome urged all the faithful to devote an hour of silent prayer for the pope before evening vespers services, and pilgrims who had planned to attend his weekly general audience came to St. Peter's Square anyway to offer a prayer after it was cancelled.",
      "\u201cI think many people are disappointed but I think more importantly we really have to pray for his health,\" said Sister Charlene, a nun from Singapore who was in the piazza.",
      "Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest CT scan showed the onset of bilateral pneumonia on top of asthmatic bronchitis, which is being treated with cortisone and antibiotics.",
      "Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs\u2019 air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part or all of one lung or in both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn\u2019t healthy tissue to compensate.",
      "Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids \u2014 and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date, Francis is breathing on his own and his heart function is said to be good. He has eaten breakfast every day, gotten out of bed, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a strong man who does not let difficulties get him down,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who heads a new Vatican committee on children. The fact that Francis is keeping up with his ordinary routine, including receiving the Eucharist, \u201cis a sign of a man who wants to experience the ordinariness of illness in the hospital.\u201d",
      "The Vatican hasn't provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn't running a fever. The Argentine pope, who has previously admitted to being a non-compliant patient, has a number of conditions that make him particularly at risk for complications: Aside from his age, he is not physically active and uses a wheelchair, limiting his ability to clear the fluids building up in his lungs.",
      "Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said doctors will be looking to see if Francis responds to the therapy, which can include physiotherapy to help clear the lungs. Severe cases of pneumonia are typically treated for about one to two weeks, but recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "\"Lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign,\u201d said McCormack, who is not involved in Francis' care.",
      "The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d would require an \u201cadequate\u201d stay.",
      "Despite the less than positive news about Francis' condition, Francis was receiving get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital's oncology ward. And at the Vatican on Wednesday, Holy Year pilgrimages continued, with groups of faithful walking through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica on a chilly and cloudy day.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy to be here but we are also sad for the pope\u2019s sickness,\" said Amparo Alcala\u2019, who was leading a large group of pilgrims from Valencia, Spain. \"He is doing great things, most of all for the women in the church, and this gives us a lot of joy. We are praying for his recovery and that he might come back, if this is God\u2019s will.\u201d",
      "A group of South Korean pilgrims in traditional costumes had planned to attend Francis' weekly Wednesday general audience and show off their national dress, as pilgrims often do for the pope's weekly appointment. When it was cancelled, they came anyway.",
      "\u201cThe Lunar New Year was very recent so we also wanted to bow traditionally and formally in front of him,\" said Junhee Christina Kim, a pilgrim from Seoul, South Korea. \"It was too good of a chance to pass up so we came anyway so that we can be in the Vatican in our traditional costumes.\u201d",

      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is in court for a hearing where his lawyers are contesting his arrest on a criminal charge alleging he was orchestrating a rebellion when he imposed martial law",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in court Thursday for a hearing where his lawyers contested his arrest on a criminal charge alleging he was orchestrating a rebellion when he briefly imposed martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived at the Seoul Central District Court and dozens of his supporters rallied nearby.",
      "The preliminary hearing will involve discussions of witnesses and other preparations for his criminal trial, and the court was also to review the request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful.",
      "Yoon was indicted Jan. 26 on the rebellion charge carrying a potential punishment of death or life in prison. In South Korea, presidents have immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason.",
      "The indictment alleges his imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. The conservative Yoon has said his martial law declaration was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers\u2019 will if they voted to lift the measure.",

      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",

      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- They\u2019re known as \u201cfrog men,\u201d inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.",
      "Thousands of them are crammed into the country\u2019s severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.",
      "Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.",
      "\u201cPrisons have become no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Rodolfo Valent\u00edn Santos, director of the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Public Defense Office.",
      "Over 60% of the country\u2019s roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.",
      "But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "He noted that the country\u2019s Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an \u201cexceptional\u201d measure. There are six other measures that don\u2019t involve prison time, including bail, but Valent\u00edn said they are rarely used.",
      "On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzm\u00e1n walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.",
      "The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.",
      "It is the country\u2019s oldest and most populated prison.",
      "\u201cYou have to watch out for your life,\u201d said Lugo, who with Guzm\u00e1n visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of them who are not doing well,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said of inmates there. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme poverty.\u201d",
      "They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone\u2019s SIM card be recharged.",
      "Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country\u2019s deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Hig\u00fcey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.",
      "After last year\u2019s fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country\u2019s more than 40 prisons.",
      "\u201cWe must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country\u2019s prisons,\u201d Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.",
      "Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country\u2019s western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from politicians or anyone else,\u201d said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.",
      "Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.",
      "Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria \u2014 he spent two years in solitary confinement there.",
      "In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country's other 19 prisons.",
      "But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic's National Commission of Human Rights.",
      "\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2019s prison system is on the brink of collapse,\u201d the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.",
      "In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valent\u00edn, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.",
      "In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.",
      "\u201cThe level of overcrowding\u2026makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,\u201d the report read. \u201cIn the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.\u201d",
      "Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hern\u00e1ndez has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germ\u00e1n Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germ\u00e1n said she is not granting media interviews.",
      "Both Santana and Valent\u00edn said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.",
      "Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.",
      "Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.",
      "While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.",
      "The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge.",

      "Mike Burgess, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the nation\u2019s main domestic spy agency known as ASIO, did not name the countries in his latest annual address outlining threats to the country.",
      "One government attempted to trick a human rights advocate into traveling from Australia to a third country where plotters planned to injure or kill their target. ASIO intervened to prevent the travel.",
      "\u201cIn a small number of cases, we held grave fears for the life of the person being targeted,\u201d Burgess said in a speech at ASIO headquarters in the national capital Canberra.",
      "Another government planned to harm or kill one or more people in Australia as part of a broader plot to eliminate critics around the world. Working with international security agencies, ASIO disrupted the operation at an early stage.",
      "In both cases, the plotters were offshore and beyond the reach of Australian law.",
      "Burgess didn\u2019t detail the third country\u2019s plot.",
      "In a wide-ranging speech, Burgess revealed ASIO had alerted U.S. authorities to a 12-year-old boy plotting mass shootings in the United States.",
      "ASIO online operators found a self-professed neo-Nazi on a popular social networking site. The boy talked about live streaming a school shooting and then moving on to a church, synagogue or mosque.",
      "The Australian spy agency also discovered a cyber unit from an unnamed foreign government that targeted critical infrastructure networks in the U.S. The same unit routinely tried to explore and exploit Australia\u2019s networks, mapping systems to lay down malware or maintain access in the future.",
      "\u201cASIO worked closely with our American counterpart to evict the hackers and shut down their global accesses, including nodes here in Australia,\u201d Burgess said.",

      "The 5x3.5-centimeter (1.95x1.2-inch) stickers are printed with a QR code, that, when scanned, shows the name of the person buried in the grave and its location in the cemetery \u2014 but nothing else.",

      "Police are not only trying to find out who is behind the stickers, but are also investigating property damage, because the gravestones were partially damaged and discolored when the stickers were removed.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Long-haul carrier Etihad Airways announced Wednesday it made a record $476 million profit in 2024, part of a financial rebound for the Abu Dhabi-based airline.",
      "While still a slender profit compared to rival Emirates' record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023, it continues to a major turnaround for Etihad.",
      "The airline had revenues of nearly $6.9 billion in 2024, compared to $5.5 billion in 2023. Its profit in 2023 was just $143 million.",
      "Etihad attributed its higher profit to increased passenger numbers, a recovery in its cargo operations and cutting its costs. It flew 18.5 million passengers in 2024, up 32%. Its cargo revenues for the year were $1.1 billion, up 24%.",
      "\u201cThese results are testament to the dedication of our people who have worked together for a purpose: delivering our strategy,\" CEO Antonoaldo Neves said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, I am confident we will continue to be a financially strong airline delivering extraordinary customer experiences, fulfilling our shareholders' mandate and contributing to the long-term prosperity and success of the UAE.\u201d",

      "Etihad struggled with its business plan and underwent cost-cutting measures even before the COVID pandemic. Since 2016, Etihad has lost some $6 billion as it has aggressively bought up stakes in airlines from Europe to Asia to compete against Emirates and Qatar Airways.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS will lay off roughly 7,000 workers in Washington and around the country beginning Thursday, a person familiar with the plans told The Associated Press.",
      "The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.",
      "The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.",
      "It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.",
      "The IRS has roughly 90,000 employees total across the United States, according to the latest IRS data. Racial minorities make up 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent 65%.",
      "In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.",

      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority.

      "South Africa\u2019s budget announcement by the finance minister has been abruptly canceled and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African government's annual presentation of its budget was abruptly canceled Wednesday and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition.",
      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. The move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",
      "Africa\u2019s most advanced economy has barely grown in recent years. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told reporters that the government was facing fiscal challenges.",
      "\u201cDo we borrow more, and what are the implications of that?\u201d Godongwana said. \u201cDo we continue cutting expenditure? What are the implications of that? Do we raise tax and what are the implications of that?\u201d",

      "The Black Business Council, which advocates for Black-owned businesses' inclusion in the country's economy, has cautioned that the budget postponement might cause uncertainty among investors.",
      "\u201cWe are busy dealing with the Trump issue, and we are working on sending envoys to the world to say (South Africa) is intact, but when you have something like this that you can control, and you just basically throw your arms in the air, it doesn\u2019t bode very well for South Africa and for the government,\" said the council's CEO Kganki Matabane.",

      "Car companies are always introducing compelling new models, making it harder to decide if you should get a new car, truck or SUV now or wait to see what else might be available within the year",
      "Ready to buy a new car? Well, you might want to wait because there are some cool and compelling models coming soon to a showroom near you. They range from a retro-themed performance sedan with a traditional gasoline engine to a rugged off-road SUV powered by electricity. There\u2019s even a pickup truck that offers a gas engine and electric propulsion simultaneously, which could be a game changer. Edmunds\u2019 editors highlight what they think will be the most interesting vehicles for car shoppers coming out later this year.",
      "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the Charger Daytona R/T, Dodge\u2019s new electric performance coupe that draws design inspiration from the classic 1969 Charger. But what if you don\u2019t want an EV? And what if you need four doors? Good news is on the horizon, and it takes the form of the 2026 Charger Sixpack four-door sedan equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder gas engine.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cHurricane,\u201d the engine makes 420 horsepower in standard-output specification, more than the 5.7-liter V8 available in the old Charger. We also expect Dodge will follow it up later with a high-output engine making 550 horsepower.",
      "The Honda Prelude was a showcase of Honda design and engineering in the 1980s and 1990s. But after the 2001 model year, it disappeared from the automaker\u2019s lineup. A quarter of a century later, it\u2019s finally coming back.",
      "The all-new 2026 Honda Prelude will be a hybrid. We expect Honda will use the hybrid powertrain that it uses in the hybrid versions of the CR-V and Civic. Honda hasn\u2019t said how much power it will make or what kind of fuel economy you can expect. However, the Prelude will come with a Honda S+ Shift feature that the company says will make the it more fun to drive than your typical hybrid.",
      "With few exceptions, most electric SUVs are best driven on the pavement instead of off-road. Jeep plans to change that with the upcoming 2026 Recon, a bold and boxy EV with promising trail-rated off-roading capability and a similar open-air driving experience to a Wrangler.",
      "Jeep recently featured the Recon in a commercial starring Harrison Ford. Beyond that, however, the company has provided few details. We don\u2019t know how much range the Recon will have or how much it will cost. But we do know it will come with all-terrain tires, skid plates, a power-opening top, and removable windows and doors. And with trail guide maps embedded into the infotainment system and electronic locking axles, the Jeep Recon should be ready to rock on the path less traveled.",
      "Boasting one of the most appropriate vehicle names in history, the Ram Ramcharger is a full-size pickup truck equipped with electric motors and a battery pack. So far, that\u2019s just like a Ford F-150 Lightning. The trick is that it also has a gasoline-fueled V6 engine to eliminate the problem of range anxiety.",
      "Ram\u2019s range-extending powertrain solution sounds complex, but there is a simple explanation of how it works. When the battery is out of charge, the gas engine serves as a backup generator, allowing the Ramcharger to travel an estimated 690 miles before requiring electricity or gasoline to continue the journey. In theory, you can drive the Ramcharger without ever visiting an EV charging station, or you can skip traditional gas stations altogether.",
      "Better yet, there aren\u2019t any downsides when it comes to capability. Ram says the Ramcharger can tow up to 14,000 pounds and zoom to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.",
      "Current Rivian trucks and SUVs are expensive, but the upcoming R2 SUV addresses that with a target price of $45,000. Smaller than the existing R1S but equipped with the same rugged, high-tech good looks, the Rivian R2 holds five people and travels more than 300 miles on a full battery. It comes with all-wheel drive and a healthy 9.8 inches of maximum ground clearance to help you out when going off-road.",
      "With rear vent windows and back glass that powers down into the tailgate, the Rivian R2 will give the Jeep Recon some competition. Just remember the R2\u2019s doors don\u2019t come off like the Recon\u2019s. As for timing, it should be available in the first half of 2026.",
      "We like these five upcoming models for their nostalgic appeal, technological innovation, or promise of fun no matter where you\u2019re going or what you\u2019re doing. At least one of them, the Jeep Recon, delivers all three of those traits.",

      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose to a 10-month high in January, official figures showed Wednesday, an increase that will likely diminish expectations of rapid interest rate reductions from the Bank of England.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose to 3% in the year to January, up from the equivalent 2.5% rate the month before.",
      "The spike, which took inflation further above the bank's target of 2%, was largely due to increases in airfares, food casts and private school fees in the wake of the new Labour government's decision to impose a sales tax.",
      "Economists had anticipated an increase to 2.8% but the scale of the spike has come as a big surprise and will likely cause concern among rate-setters at the central bank at a time when they are voicing worries about about the U.K.'s tepid economic growth.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, its third reduction in six months, as it halved its 2025 growth forecast for the U.K. to 0.75%.",
      "If growth remains that modest, it will be hugely disappointing news for the U.K.\u2019s new Labour government, which has made growth its number one mission as it will boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services. With growth proving elusive, the party\u2019s popularity has fallen sharply since its election victory in July.",
      "The government will no doubt be hoping that the central bank helps it out by cutting interest rates further as it will contribute to lower mortgage rates and cheaper loans, though reducing the returns offered to savers.",
      "Most economists think that inflation will rise further in the coming months as a result of higher domestic energy bills but start to trend lower in the second half of the year, which will give -policymakers room to cut interest rates again \u2014 but maybe not as many times as previously thought.",
      "\u201cAnother rate cut in March looks pretty unlikely, with the bank continuing with its gradual pace of easing for now,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management. \"But any speeding up of the pace of rate cuts in the second half of the year will depend on inflation pressures heading back towards 2%\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says his administration will ensure a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska gets built",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Since his election, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska \u2014 comments that have drawn fresh attention to a project that's floundered for years despite support from state leaders.",
      "Trump mentioned the pipeline at a news conference with Japan\u2019s prime minister earlier this month, drawing praise from Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, both Republicans. As proposed, the nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline would funnel gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries.",
      "Critics, however, see this as a repackaged version of a decades-old effort that has struggled to gain traction. Hurdles include the cost \u2014 an estimated $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure \u2014 competition from other projects and questions about its economic feasibility. One state senator said Alaska has put around $1 billion over the years into trying to get a pipeline built.",
      "It\u2019s natural gas that\u2019s been cooled to a liquid form for shipping and storage. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is extracted from underground.",
      "The Alaska project calls for a pipeline from the gas fields of the North Slope to south-central Alaska. A liquefaction facility in Nikiski, southwest of Anchorage, would process and export the liquefied natural gas.",
      "Trump, following his election, said his administration would ensure the project gets built \u201cto provide affordable energy to Alaska and allies all over the world.\u201d He highlighted it as a priority in an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at spurring resource development he signed on his first day in office. And during a recent news conference with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan, Trump touted the Alaska project's relative proximity to that country and said there were talks \u201cabout a joint venture of some type.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "Japan's Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the meeting between the leaders \u201cwas carried out in a way that would be beneficial to both sides and confirmed that the two nations will cooperate bilaterally toward strengthening energy security, including increasing LNG exports to Japan.\u201d It did not specifically reference the Alaska project.",
      "Trump was a booster of the project during his first term. In 2017, he was there for the signing in Beijing of an agreement between then-Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and representatives of Chinese companies that called for the parties to work together on elements of the project. That effort ultimately fizzled: Walker, an independent, left office in 2018, and his successor, Dunleavy, took the project in a different direction. The project has a history of new governors taking a different tack than their predecessors; Walker did it, too.",

      "Currently, there is no way to bring Alaska's large gas reserves to market. The focus for decades by major companies on the North Slope has been on producing more profitable oil. The 800-mile (1,280-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline \u2014 which began operating in 1977 \u2014 is the state's economic lifeline. Gas that occurs with deposits of oil is reinjected into the fields.",
      "Changing markets and costs have been major obstacles, too.",
      "State leaders are facing the likelihood that Alaska could have to import gas to help meet the needs of its most populous region due to production constraints in the aging Cook Inlet basin in south-central Alaska, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the North Slope. Cook Inlet is Alaska's oldest producing oil and gas basin, dating to the 1950s.",
      "Even a year ago, the idea of importing gas was widely seen by lawmakers as a humiliating possibility. But it's now being met with resignation and hopes by some that it might simply be a short-term solution until a gas line is built.",

      "Roger Marks, an oil and gas economist in Alaska, said he can't see the pipeline project happening and said more energy should be devoted to preparing for possible imports. \u201cCreating these false expectations has just been a big distraction from what needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Johor in Malaysia is being transformed by the construction of giant data centers",
      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",

The announcement from Trudeau and Transport Minister Anita Anand comes after years of debate and extensive study of options to improve commuter rail service in central Canada.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 08:17:27 -0500",

      "A new poll finds Americans\u2019 confidence in air transportation and the federal agencies tasked with maintaining air safety has slipped a little from last year, following a recent crash in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans' confidence in air travel and the federal agencies tasked with maintaining air safety has slipped a little from last year, following a recent crash in Washington, according to a new poll, but most still believe air transportation is generally safe.",
      "The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 64% of U.S. adults say plane travel is \u201cvery safe\u201d or \u201csomewhat safe.\u201d That's down slightly from last year, when 71% said that. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults now say air transportation is very or somewhat unsafe, up from 12% in 2024.",
      "Faith in government agencies' ability to ensure safe air travel dipped as well. Just over half of U.S. adults have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety, down slightly from about 6 in 10 last year.",
      "The poll was conducted Feb. 6-10, shortly after the Jan. 30 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter in Washington but before a Delta jet flipped on its roof while landing in Toronto. The Washington collision, which killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, was the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster since 2001. The decline in confidence, while small, suggests that the event may have rattled some Americans. The 2024 poll was conducted after another incident that raised questions about the safety of air travel, in which a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner above Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.",
      "Overall, Americans think traveling by plane is about as safe as walking or taking a car. About two-thirds say either walking or driving are safe forms of transportation. Only about half of U.S. adults say a local subway, metro or light rail system is safe, in line with 2024.",
      "After the Washington crash, President Donald Trump, a Republican, blamed federal diversity and inclusion promotion efforts and reassured Americans that it is safe to fly. That may help explain why Democrats and independents, but not Republicans, have seen a drop in trust.",
      "Independents' belief that plane travel is safe fell substantially, from about 6 in 10 calling it safe last year to about 4 in 10 now. About 7 in 10 Democrats say plane travel is safe, down slightly from about three-quarters in 2024. Republicans have not changed their views about air travel being safe.",
      "Democrats and independents also have less faith in the government's ability to ensure air safety than they did four years ago. The poll was conducted before the firing of probationary Federal Aviation Administration employees, but at least some of the shift is likely related to the change in presidential administration, from Joe Biden, a Democrat, to Trump.",
      "In January 2024, when Biden was still president, about 7 in 10 Democrats said they had high confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety. Now only 6 in 10 Democrats say that. Independents' confidence also declined, while Republicans' opinions did not move.",
      "The poll found that U.S. adults' confidence in pilots and commercial airlines remains unchanged. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults have a high level of confidence in pilots, and about three-quarters say that about commercial airlines.",
      "___",
      "The AP-NORC poll of 1,112 adults was conducted Feb. 6-10, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

      "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.",
      "Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits \u2014 a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d Musk wrote, as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Late Monday, Musk posted a slew of posts on his social media platform X, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system called COBOL, which has a lack of date type in its programming. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

      "Hundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.",
      "The backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d",
      "Indivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party.

      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province, where he raises a kaleidoscope of tropical fish in rows of aquariums, including albino fish with red spots that can fetch up to $10,000 from collectors. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages.",
      "To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia's data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America\u2019s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba.",
      "These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed new rules that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn\u2019t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",
      "But concerns are rising among residents about potential water shortages in the future \u2014 echoing the concerns of other developing countries like Chile. Malaysia, like much of Southeast Asia, is at risk of extreme weather including drought, according to a 2022 U.N. climate change report. Francis Hutchinson, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Johor has faced recent disruptions and new stressors, like a growing population and water parks to boost tourism, could exacerbate the crisis.",
      "\u201cWater, more than power, is a potential issue,\u201d he said.",

      "Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appear to gain momentum with a visit by a top Chinese official to the border zone ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry",
      "BANGKOK -- Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appeared to gain momentum on Monday as a top Chinese security official visited both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry.",
      "The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.",
      "Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations.",
      "The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers.",
      "The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference on Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts.",
      "Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking.",
      "Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries.",
      "The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit.",
      "Liu visited the border areas in Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation.",
      "Video of Liu\u2019s visit showed hundreds of people there sitting on the ground with their belongings in a large open-walled hall.",
      "\u201c China is actively conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries, taking comprehensive measures to address both the symptoms and root causes, and working together to block criminals from committing crimes in relevant countries,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing.",
      "\u201cThis is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people\u2019s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.\u201d",
      "Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors.",
      "Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state.",
      "Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated."

Eleven senior leadership positions, representing 15% of the company's senior management committee, are being eliminated.",

      "\u201cThis decision is unprecedented in our 53-year history, and change requires that we make difficult decisions,\" Jordan said.",
      "Southwest estimated that the job cuts will save the company about $210 million this year and roughly $300 million in 2026.",
      "In November, the airline offered buyouts and extended leaves of absence to airport workers, including customer service agents, baggage handlers and cargo workers, in a bid to avoid \u201coverstaffing in certain locations.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend",
      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend. He's now going back to school.",
      "A nostalgic time for Phoenix's All-Star forward continues Thursday, when Durant and the Suns play San Antonio in Austin, Texas \u2014 a home game for the Spurs and a homecoming for Durant, since the game brings him back to where he played his one college season with the Longhorns.",
      "\u201cIt does mean a lot to me,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that we get to go back to play a regular-season game there. Austin is a place where I kind of started this journey, and to have so many friends and family that are still there from, what, 16, 17 years ago is pretty sweet. So, I appreciate the NBA for setting this up. This is a unique time.\u201d",
      "Durant\u2019s lone season in Austin was 2006-07, and he was college basketball\u2019s best player that year. He averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds, finishing the season ranked fourth nationally in both of those categories on his way to being selected as player of the year by The Associated Press and a number of other outlets.",
      "He declared for the draft after that season, went No. 2 overall to Seattle in 2007 and the accolades keep piling up. Durant is the only men's player in USA Basketball history to win four Olympic gold medals, he won two championships with Golden State \u2014 returning to the Bay this past weekend after being selected as an All-Star for the 15th time \u2014 and just became the eighth player in NBA history to eclipse the 30,000-point mark.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for himself \u2014 and for the city of Austin to come out and support one of our great players who is still in the prime of his career right now,\" Texas coach Rodney Terry said. \"He's scored over 30,000 points, he's one of the all-time scorers at the next level, one of the all-time scorers at the collegiate level. But to have an opportunity come back where you played collegiately, to play a professional game against one of the best organizations in all of professional sports in the Spurs, you can\u2019t ask for a better scenario.\u201d",
      "This is the third consecutive season where the Spurs have played two home games in Austin, about 75 miles northeast of San Antonio. The Spurs see Austin as part of a mega-region that they've been cultivating for years, even stretching into Mexico \u2014 and this year's home games help break up the annual rodeo road trip. The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo typically sends the Spurs on the road for much of February, so this year's games in Austin break up that window.",
      "The Spurs also play in Austin on Friday against Detroit. The Suns got to Austin on Tuesday and one of Durant's first stops was the Longhorns' practice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to try to roam around the city a little bit,\u201d Durant said this past weekend when asked if he had plans to check out some of his favorite places in Austin. \u201cI don\u2019t have a set schedule, but I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to see.\u201d",
      "Austin is very much a Spurs town; the team's G League affiliate plays there and plenty of fans at the Moody Center on Thursday and Friday will surely be wearing Victor Wembanyama jerseys. But there's going to be a slew of Texas jerseys and Durant garb visible in the crowd on Thursday, for good reason.",
      "\u201cTo have him come back here and be here this week and be around our guys and see our guys, I mean, you can\u2019t ask for anything better than that,\" Terry said. \"A lot of our guys' favorite player is Kevin Durant. Why they chose to come to Texas was Kevin Durant. He's had an incredible impact not only on our basketball program but also on our athletic program as a whole. He\u2019s an incredible ambassador for Texas athletics.\u201d",

      "Alexander-Arnold ran onto an inside pass from Salah and drove in a shot that deflected past Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez in the 61st as Liverpool salvaged a point, avoiding what would have been just a second league defeat of the season.",
      "Liverpool has now played a game more than second-place Arsenal, which appears to be the only other realistic challenger for the title, and has another tough away game on Sunday at Manchester City.",
      "Liverpool is seeking a 20th top-flight championship to tie the record of Manchester United.",
      "Salah is spearheading Liverpool's title charge. Not only is the Egypt forward the league's top scorer, with five more than nearest challenger Erling Haaland of Manchester City, he has more assists than anyone else with 15.",
      "Should Arsenal wind up reeling in Liverpool, the Reds may regret a big miss from Darwin Nunez after the Uruguay striker came on as a substitute. Dominik Szoboszlai ran through a squared the ball to Nunez, who had an open goal at which to aim with a left-footed shot.",
      "Nunez blazed the finish high and wide, with Liverpool manager Arne Slot barely believing what he had seen on the touchline.",

      "To help reach it, the USTA on Wednesday pledged $10 million in grants in 2025 \u201cto help build, refurbish and extend playable hours on courts across the United States.\u201d That is up from last year's commitment of $1.2 million, which covered more than 500 courts open to the public.",

      "The statistics the USTA touted Wednesday are based on the National Golf Foundation's compilation of data from two surveys that the USTA helps fund, each of 18,000 people aged 6 and over: The Physical Activity Council (PAC) Study on Sports and Physical Activity, and the PLAY study.",
      "Other findings noted by the USTA include:",
      "\u2014 Players under age 25 drove 45% of the growth in tennis participation last year, while those under 35 accounted for more than 60%.",

      "BOSTON -- The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams tried to skate back the geopolitical tension that has infiltrated the 4 Nations Face-Off as they looked ahead to the championship game Thursday night for what has turned into one of the best international hockey tournaments in decades.",
      "Setting aside the animosity that has been building over tariff talks, anthems and annexation, the players and coaches said they wanted to leave their fans with an appreciation for the game like the one they picked up from iconic events like the United States\u2019 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d victory over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics.",
      "\u201cThat event in USA Hockey inspired a generation of players: my generation,\u201d said U.S. coach Mike Sullivan, who was 11 when the Americans won the gold medal in Lake Placid.",
      "\u201cI think this group that we have in our dressing room have an opportunity to do that and inspire the next generation. And I think they recognize that,\u201d said Sullivan, who followed several of the U.S. Olympians to Boston University before an 11-year NHL playing career and two decades more as a coach. \u201cWithout a doubt, that 1980 team, still to this day, has had such an influence on American hockey.\u201d",
      "After sitting out the last two Winter Olympics, the NHL\u2019s best returned to international play this month for a tournament that replaced the league\u2019s All-Star Game, a midseason exhibition that mattered little and was treated by the players as such.",
      "Instead, the United States, Canada, Finland and Sweden all sent their stars. And something happened once they started playing for their countries: The hockey has been historic, especially the fight-filled round-robin matchup between the North Americans on Saturday that was the most-watched non-Stanley Cup Final game in a decade.",
      "\u201cAnybody that thought they were going to come in here and see an All-Star Game was sorely, sorely mistaken. This has been anything but,\u201d Canada coach Jon Cooper said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been all-stars, but it\u2019s not been an All-Star Game.\u201d",
      "Add in the cross-border tension following President Donald Trump's tariff war and his calls for Canada to be made the 51st state, and the tournament has much of the flavor of the Cold War meeting with the Soviets in Lake Placid.",
      "Canadian fans loudly booed the U.S. national anthem Saturday night in Montreal. in Boston on Monday, when the TD Garden public address announcer called for respect, the payback for \u201cO Canada\u201d was tepid; instead, the Americans belted out \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at full throat.",
      "\u201cAll that stuff \u2014 throw it all out the window. It\u2019s one game here, and one game for everything,\u201d U.S. forward Matthew Tkachuk said. \u201cOur team\u2019s helped grow the game here in this country already. And I think a win can just knock that door right down and open up a whole new wave of hockey players throughout the whole country.\u201d",
      "Canadian forward Brad Marchand, who plays for the Boston Bruins and will be skating on what is ordinarily his home ice, dismissed the political angle, saying the hockey was good enough to sell itself. He recalled watching in his family\u2019s basement when the Canadians beat the U.S. in the gold medal game of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.",
      "And he hopes some kid in Nova Scotia was watching when the Americans and Canadians matched up on Saturday in Montreal, or again on Thursday night in Boston.",
      "\u201cThis will be another memory, another core memory for a lot of a lot of kids growing up, a lot of hockey fans for both American and Canadian players \u2014 and probably kids all across the world,\" he said. \"So it\u2019s a gift and a privilege to play in these games. And definitely one you don\u2019t take for granted.\u201d",
      "The 3-1 U.S. victory in the round-robin began with three fights in the first nine seconds, then settled into a fast-paced clinic that ranks among the top games in international hockey history.",
      "The sequel \u201cfeels bigger than that,\u201d Tkachuk said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an incredible environment,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, wearing the jersey and representing your country is such an incredible honor and what we play for. But the opportunity that we have is something that -- I don\u2019t even think we thought was possible and what we could create.\u201d",
      "That's what compelled Ted Sells to make a five-hour drive from his home in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, to a 12-hour flight through Calgary and Dallas to get to Boston for the title game. He wandered through the TD Garden pro shop looking for Canadian gear and saw none; a clerk told him they were sold out.",
      "Sells said he hoped the teams could set aside the politics and just play hockey.",
      "\u201cEverybody has their team and their favorite,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they shake hands at the end. And that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Across the store James Kopacki said he had no animosity toward the Canadians; he was deciding whether to buy his wife, a Bruins fan, a Marchand jersey. The U.S. Navy veteran came up from Fort Worth, Texas, to watch the game, buying tickets after watching the Americans beat Canada in the opening round.",
      "\u201cThat game turned out to be so good. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a game like that, as far as the tension and the desire to win. And not just that: the tension between our countries.\u201d",
      "Kopacki said he spent $1,500 on the tickets, and he's been monitoring the price as the hype increases.",
      "\u201cIf the tickets reach $5,000,\" he said, \u201cthen we\u2019re going to sell them and go to a bar in Boston and watch for free.\u201d",

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- From the pinstripes of New York all the way to the Dodger blues of Los Angeles, there is a strong connection among the clubhouse staffers who wash the dirt-caked, hard-worn uniforms of the major leagues.",
      "Just like the players who wear the jerseys.",
      "\u201cThe clubhouse community is really close,\u201d says Riley Halpin, 29, a clubhouse attendant for the San Francisco Giants.",
      "\u201cThere's not a guy in the league I don't think that I can't call with a laundry question that won't answer it,\u201d says Kiere Bulls, a home clubhouse manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates.",
      "On the eve of another season \u2014 as players throw their spring training apparel into hampers on wheels in Arizona and Florida \u2014 here is a closer look how laundry is done in the major leagues, along with a few tips for your own dirty uniforms \u2014 and other items \u2014 at home:",
      "TEAM: Chicago White Sox",
      "LAUNDERER: Rob Warren, clubhouse manager",
      "TIP: Dirt on uniforms is more difficult to get out than grass stains. When it comes to the biggest laundry challenges, he preaches patience. \u201cWe'll throw it in, and then usually check it again,\u201d he says. \u201cWe'll run it through once and then after that first load is when we kind of do the scrubbing and spraying.\u201d",
      "QUOTABLE: \u201cSo we'll get the first load started within 15, 20 minutes after the end of a game,\u201d Warren says. \u201cBasically as soon as we have enough to start a load, we'll start a load. Things will change that time. Sometimes a win is quicker or shorter, or you know, getaway day, hopefully quicker.\u201d",
      "TEAM: Cleveland Guardians",
      "LAUNDERER: Sam Hindes, home clubhouse supervisor",
      "TIP: Soaking is important. When it comes to tough stains, sometimes they let the uniforms soak overnight in a mixture of detergent and other products. \"Then a big thing that works is a lot of people don't know that pressure, like not necessarily a pressure washer, but the higher the pressure on the water, the better it gets stains out,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really knew that until I started doing the uniforms.\u201d",
      "QUOTABLE: Hindes says position players usually have the dirtiest uniforms \u2014 one in particular. \u201cJos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez is one that you always know is going to come back that night and it's going to need some work on it,\u201d Hindes says. \u201cHe has pine tar on his jersey and he's always out there, he's a grinder. He steals bases. He's always diving all over the place. He plays his heart out.\u201d",
      "TEAM: New York Yankees",
      "LAUNDERER: Lou Cucuzza Jr., director of clubhouse operations",
      "LAUNDRY TIP: It's all about \u201cpretreating\u201d and letting the pretreat treatment soak in for a while. \u201cSo if you've got something dirty and you're pretreating it, don't throw it right into the machine because that pretreat's just going to get washed away. You want that pretreat really to soak up that stain and separate the fibers of the uniform or apparel, whatever you're wearing.\u201d",
      "QUOTABLE: The clay that surrounds the field differs around the majors, presenting a unique challenge \u201cSo we could come off the road or I'll get a team off the road that played, let's say, in Baltimore. They have a tough clay or Boston, their clay is very different than the clay at Yankee Stadium,\u201d Cucuzza says. \u201cThe clay at Yankee Stadium, I have no problem getting visiting uniforms clean. It's really quick. Sometimes I'll get a team, maybe from Baltimore, and it's like, wow, that's a tough red clay. It's a little hard getting out so it may have to go through two washes to get it out.\u201d",
      "TEAM: Philadelphia Phillies",
      "LAUNDERER: Sean Bowers, home clubhouse assistant",
      "TIP: Using the right chemicals is crucial. Some of the laundry chemicals in big league clubhouses aren't widely available, but Bowers says he likes Goof Off for pine tar stains and detergents with protein release for dirt-related issues.",
      "QUOTABLE: \u201cWhen the field gets painted, getting the paint out is really tough. Just a regular grass stain I can get out fairly easily. But the paint, especially around opening day or after there's concerts and where the stage was, they have to take care of that part of the field. Those outfielders, it's really difficult to get that out.\u201d",
      "TEAM: Pittsburgh Pirates",
      "LAUNDERER: Kiere Bulls, home clubhouse manager",
      "TIP: For uniforms (and, presumably, anything else) caked with dirt, Bulls recommends spraying off as much of it as possible before it even goes into the laundry. He has some chemicals that he uses at the ballpark, but he likes OxiClean and Shout for dirt predicaments at home.",
      "QUOTABLE: \u201cThere's a lot of times that if a player's real, real bad that it may have to get washed three times just to get the stains out. But the uniforms are hung dry. ... They don't go in the dryer. They just get washed and hung right outside the lockers.\u201d",
      "TEAM: San Francisco Giants",
      "LAUNDERER: Riley Halpin, clubhouse attendant",
      "TIP: Halpin says washing uniforms is \u201ca trial-and-error process\u201d much of the time. \u201cObviously when it comes to the at-home kind of washing, you don\u2019t have these top-of-the-line chemicals that professional teams have,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I would say just do a little bit of research. ... Find out what the top kind of brands people are using at the Walmarts and stuff like that. And go with it.\u201d",
      "QUOTABLE: Halpin says he gets to the ballpark around noon for a typical night game and leaves around 1 a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s long days. But it\u2019s kind of what you sign up for, you know, with this job. And it\u2019s super cool just to obviously get to do what we get to do. So we all put up with it.\u201d",

      "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.",
      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",
      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers it fired as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s broad cuts because they were involved in the government\u2019s response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farm...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",
      "\u201cAt a time when producers are already grappling with the bird flu, the public is facing high prices, and all Americans are on edge about what broader spread of this virus could mean, the last thing the administration should have done was to eliminate these positions,\" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. \"USDA must rehire these crucial personnel immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said this week that the USDA might change its approach to the bird flu outbreak, so that maybe entire flocks wouldn't have to be slaughtered when the disease is found, but they have yet to offer many details of their plan.",

      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\u201d Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Huawei on Tuesday held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone, which analysts said marked a symbolic victory for the Chinese tech giant amid U.S. technology curbs. But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",
      "\u201cRight now, Huawei kind of stands alone as an innovator\" with the trifold design, said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research with the market intelligence firm International Data Corporation.",
      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",

In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "As U.S. tech titans ascend to prominent roles under President Donald Trump, the AP\u2019s findings raise questions about Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the future of automated warfare. Microsoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.",
      "Hossam Nasr, one of the employees fired by Microsoft who works with the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, said he and former colleagues are pushing for Microsoft to stop selling cloud and AI services to the Israeli military.",
      "\u201cCloud and AI are the bombs and bullets of the 21st century,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cMicrosoft is providing the Israeli military with digital weapons to kill, maim and displace Palestinians, in the gravest moral travesty of our time.\u201d",
      "In April, Google fired about 50 of its workers over a sit-in at the company\u2019s California headquarters protesting the war in Gaza.",
      "Former Google software engineer Emaan Haseem was among those fired. Haseem said she worked on a team that helped test the reliability of a \u201csovereign cloud\u201d \u2014 a secure system of servers kept so separate from the rest of Google\u2019s global cloud infrastructure that even the company itself couldn't access or track the data it stores. She later learned through media reports that Google was building a sovereign cloud for Israel.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to be more and more obvious that we are literally just trying to design something where we won\u2019t have to care about how our clients are using it, and if they\u2019re using it unfairly or unethically,\u201d Haseem said.",
      "Google said the employees were fired because they disrupted work spaces and made colleagues feel unsafe. Google did not respond to specific questions about whether it was contracted to build a sovereign cloud for the Israeli military and whether it provided restrictions on the wartime use of its AI models.",
      "Gaza is now in an uneasy ceasefire. But recently, the Israeli government announced it would expand its artificial intelligence developments across all its military branches.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. tech titans keep consolidating power in Washington. Microsoft gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai got a prime seat at the president\u2019s inauguration. And OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with the president on Trump\u2019s second full day in office to talk up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure.",
      "In a new book set to be published Tuesday, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp calls for the U.S. military and its allies to work closely with Silicon Valley to design, build and acquire AI weaponry, including \u201cthe unmanned drone swarms and robots that will dominate the coming battlefield.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fate of the United States, and its allies, depends on the ability of their defense and intelligence agencies to evolve, and briskly,\u201d Karp wrote, according to an advance copy obtained by the AP.",
      "After OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it wouldn\u2019t use its AI for weapons and surveillance. Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",
      "As tech companies jockey for contracts, those who lost relatives still search for answers.",
      "\u201cEven with all this pain, I can\u2019t stop asking: Why?\u201d said Mahmoud Adnan Chour, the father of the three girls killed in the car in southern Lebanon, an engineer who was away at the time. \u201cWhy did the plane choose that car \u2014 the one filled with my children\u2019s laughter echoing from its windows?\u201d",

      "Mexico says it\u2019s awaiting a new response from Google to its request that the tech company fully restore the name Gulf of Mexico to its Google Maps service before filing a lawsuit",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico said Monday it's awaiting a new response from Google to its request that the tech company fully restore the name Gulf of Mexico to its Google Maps service before filing a lawsuit.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter addressed to her government from Cris Turner, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy. It says that Google will not change the policy it outlined after U.S. President Donald Trump declared the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",
      "Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line with Trump amid threats of tariffs and Mexico and other Latin American countries have braced themselves for promised mass deportations, the brunt of which has still not been felt.",

      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",

      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",

      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "In a joint statement, the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency said that, \"According to information communicated by the Red Cross, four caskets of deceased hostages were transferred to them, and they are being taken to IDF and ISA forces in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have confirmed the names of the four bodies that are set to be returned to Israel Thursday: Oded Lifshitz, a journalist and peace activist and Shiri Bibas and her two children -- Ariel and Kfir Bibas. Once the bodies are back in Israel, the Israeli officials will conduct forensic analysis to confirm the identities of the bodies.",
      "During the handover, Hamas released a statement that read in part, \"To the families of Bibas and Lifshitz: We would have preferred your sons to return to you alive, but your army and government leaders chose to kill them instead of bringing them back.\"",
      "\"They killed with them: 17,881 Palestinian children, in their criminal bombardment of the Gaza Strip, and we know that you know who is truly responsible for their departure,\" the statement added. \"You were the victim of a leadership that does not care about its children.\"",
      "Kfir Bibas was 8 1/2 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023 -- the youngest of the 251 hostages taken on the day the group carried out its terror attack on Israel -- the worst in the country's history. In the ensuing war, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.",
      "Oded Lifshitz's wife, Yocheved, was among the first few hostages released during the first ceasefire agreement in November 2023. Sixty-nine hostages remain in Gaza after Thursday's release.",
      "\"At this difficult time, our hearts go out to the grieving families,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.",
      "The Hostage Families Forum called for the second stage of the three-stage ceasefire to proceed, saying there is \"no time to waste.\" In the second phase of the ceasefire agreement -- which should last 42 days -- Israel is to completely withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip. Hamas and Israel also agreed to a permanent cessation of all military operations and hostilities before all remaining Israeli hostages, civilians and soldiers are released by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"We received the heart-shattering news that Shiri Bibas, her children Ariel and Kfir, and Oded Lifshitz are no longer with us. This news cuts like a knife through our hearts, the families' hearts and the hearts of people all over the world,\" the families of the hostages said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"We grieve not only for them, but for the other precious lives lost, including four more deceased hostages who will be returned next week,\" families of hostages said.",
      "Six other hostages are expected to be released on Saturday and four more bodies will be returned to Israel next week. The hostages who will be released on Saturday have been identified as Eliya Cohen, 27; Tal Shoham, 40; Omer Shem Tov, 22; Omer Wenkrat, 23; Hisham Al-Sayed, 36; and Avera Mengistu, 39, according to Israeli officials and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "Negotiations to set the terms for the second phase of the ceasefire have not started, but mediators are pushing to have talks begin as soon as possible to allow enough time for discussion before the second phase is expected to begin (the first phase is expected to last 42 days), Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Hamas has accused Israel of avoiding negotiations and says it's ready to negotiate.",
      "Last week, Hamas threatened to not release hostages over the weekend, saying Israel was not holding up its end of the ceasefire by delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza.",
      "Hamas later said the exchange would take place as planned and released three hostages this past Saturday.",

      "Five officers were indicted amid a probe into the Hanceville Police Department.",
      "An Alabama grand jury has recommended that a city's police department be \"immediately abolished,\" finding there is a \"rampant culture of corruption,\" officials said Wednesday while announcing the indictment of five of the agency's officers, including its police chief.",
      "Five Hanceville police officers were arrested and charged amid a probe into the department, Cullman County District Attorney Champ Crocker said. The spouse of one of the officers was also charged, he said.",
      "\"This is a sad day for law enforcement, but at the same time, it is a good day for the rule of law,\" Crocker said during a press briefing on Wednesday.",
      "Crocker provided limited details on the case. Though the investigation encompassed the department's evidence room and the death of a Hanceville dispatcher, 49-year-old Christopher Michael Willingham, who was found dead from a toxic drug combination at work, officials said.",
      "The Cullman County grand jury found that the Hanceville Police Department has \"failed to account for, preserve and maintain evidence and in doing so has failed crime victims and the public at large,\" making the evidence \"unusable,\" Crocker said.",
      "The grand jury further found that Willingham's death was \"the direct result of the Hanceville Police Department's negligence, lack of procedure, general incompetence and disregard for human life,\" Crocker said.",
      "None of the defendants were charged in Willingham's death, Crocker said. Though the \"unfettered access that a lot of people had\" to the evidence room is the basis of the grand jury's finding regarding the dispatcher's death, Crocker said.",
      "\"One of the most concerning things that we discovered in this process is that the Hanceville Police Department's evidence room was not secured,\" Crocker said.",
      "Crocker said that Willingham was given access, \"like a lot of other people,\" to the evidence room, including on his last day at work. The dispatcher died on Aug. 23, 2024, with the cause of death determined to be the \"combined toxic effects of fentanyl, gabapentin, diazepam, amphetamine, carisoprodol and methocarbamol,\" and the manner of death an accident, according to the state medical examiner's autopsy report.",
      "When asked if Willingham may have been exposed to fentanyl that was not kept in a secure place, Crocker said, \"Nothing was secure about the evidence room. And when Mr. Willingham was discovered, there was evidence in his office.\"",
      "A municipal judge entered an order on Wednesday calling for an audit of the evidence room, Crocker said.",
      "Among those charged are Hanceville Police Chief Jason Shane Marlin, who was charged with failure to report an ethics crime and tampering with physical evidence, Crocker said.",
      "Officers Cody Alan Kelso and Jason Scott Wilbanks were charged with computer tampering, tampering with physical evidence, conspiracy to commit a controlled substance crime and use of an official position for personal gain, Crocker said.",
      "Officer William Andrew Shelnutt was charged with tampering with physical evidence, Crocker said.",
      "Eric Michael Kelso, who was a reserve officer, and his wife, Donna Reid Kelso, were charged with unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and conspiracy to unlawfully distribute a controlled substance, Crocker said. The distribution charges are not based on the distribution of anything within the evidence room, and they are \"accused of distributing certain drugs to other individuals, including some of these other defendants,\" he said.",
      "All charges are felonies except for tampering with physical evidence, which is a misdemeanor, Crocker said. That charge alleges that the defendants \"mishandled or removed evidence from the evidence room,\" he said.",
      "The employment status of the officers charged was not immediately clear, Crocker said.",
      "The defendants surrendered on Wednesday and have since made bond, Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry said. Attorney information was not immediately available.",
      "\"There's nothing more important to us in law enforcement than good, honest law enforcement. When we have those that do wrong, it hurts us all,\" Gentry said during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "Among nearly a dozen points raised by the grand jury, it found that the department is a \"particular and ongoing threat to public safety,\" has a \"rampant culture of corruption\" and has \"recently operated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency,\" Crocker said.",
      "Crocker said the grand jury recommended that the Hanceville Police Department \"be immediately abolished\" and that another law enforcement agency be tasked with protecting the citizens of Hanceville, which has a population of around 3,000.",
      "Gentry said the sheriff's office has not received a formal request to take over the Hanceville area in Cullman County, \"but we are making preparations.\"",
      "\"We will do whatever is necessary to protect our citizens in Hanceville,\" he said.",
      "Hanceville Mayor Jim Sawyer said he and the City Council are fully cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\"The Council will carefully consider all recommendations and act swiftly and decisively to address the problems within the Police Department,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Our citizens, industries, and businesses deserve a resolution, and we will pursue and implement the necessary corrective actions openly and aggressively. We deeply regret the negative impact this situation has had on our community and the hard-working employees of our city.\"",
      "\"It is unfortunate that the actions of a few have tarnished our city's good name,\" he added.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:15:22 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are falsely implying that millions of dead Americans are receiving Social Security benefits, experts told ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Musk has implied 150-year-olds are getting checks but experts say he\u2019s mistaken.",
      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, in their hunt for \"fraud, waste and abuse\" in the federal government, are falsely implying millions of dead Americans are receiving Social Security benefits, experts told ABC News.",
      "It started in the Oval Office last week when Musk -- facing reporters for the first time since the Department of Government Efficiency began its aggressive overhaul of the federal government -- said he found \"crazy things\" in the Social Security system, including, he said, people who are \"150 years old.\"",
      "The billionaire has only built on that claim on social media, including screenshots of data he said shows millions of people marked as \"alive\" in the Social Security system when they clearly can't be.",
      "\"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,\" he wrote in one post.",
      "Then, on Tuesday, Trump repeated many of the same numbers Musk put out as he read from an extensive list at a news conference in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "\"Now, the big thing is, how many of these people got paid? Where are they getting paid? Where are they getting paid? How many of them were getting paid Social Security, because that's --- if that's the case, it's a massive fraud,\" Trump, indicating shock, told reporters.",
      "Social Security policy experts and economists told ABC News that they are getting it wrong, contending Musk is misreading the agency's records system.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) has multiple databases, including one that gets sent to the Treasury Department each month outlining who is receiving payments.",
      "According to agency statistics, of the 67 million people who receive Social Security benefits, only 0.1% are over the age of 100.",
      "\"So, when they're throwing around numbers like tens of millions of dead people are getting Social Security, well there's only 67 million total. What are they talking about? Half the people are actually dead? The numbers are so ridiculous. It's not true,\" said Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "SSA does make some improper payments, but they are not widespread (roughly 1%) and most of the mistakes made are overpayments to living beneficiaries, according to a July 2024 inspector's general report. That report found from 2015 through 2022, the SSA made $71.8 billion in improper payments. The agency issues $1 trillion in benefits every year.",
      "Another database, experts said, is called Numident and contains a record of every person who has ever been assigned a Social Security number. There are people in the system, they said, who have died but don't have a date of death recorded because they lived long before electronic records were established.",
      "This data set, experts said, has nothing to do with monthly payments but appears to be very likely where Musk is getting information that there are millions of people ages 100 to 369 in the system.",
      "Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, said it is \"transparently obvious that he's misinterpreting or misrepresenting\" the data but noted Musk is not \"showing his work.\"",
      "Musk has not explicitly said where he is getting the data he is posting to social media.",
      "Still, his insinuations that the presence of such information within SSA is nefarious or new is also misleading, experts said.",
      "The government has known the Numident system is flawed in this way for years, according to audits. A 2023 inspector general's report found nearly 19 million people born before 1920 who do not have death information in the record.",
      "The SSA decided not to address discrepancies because of how much it would cost to fix (upwards of $9 million) and the \"limited benefit\" it would have on the agency, the report noted.",
      "Romig, who previously worked in the Social Security Administration, also emphasized there are multiple checks in place to prevent deceased individuals from getting payments. The agency has a policy to automatically stop payments at the age of 115, and after a certain age they check to see that older beneficiaries are still using Medicare benefits.",
      "This isn't the first time Musk has spread false or misleading information. In the Oval Office last week, he backtracked on a claim spread prolifically by the Trump administration that USAID was sending $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza and Hamas. In fact, the condoms were sent to a province in Mozambique named Gaza as part of an HIV prevention measure.",
      "\"Well, first of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,\" Musk said. \"Nobody's going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes.\"",

      "After being held in immigration custody for over a year and facing the possibility of transfer to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the three men asked a federal court to intervene, warning they might have \u201cdisappeared into the legal black hole\u201d of Guant\u00e1namo.",
      "Last Sunday, a federal judge in New Mexico handed down a surprise ruling blocking the Trump administration from sending the men to Guant\u00e1namo -- the first successful legal challenge to the policy since it was enacted last month.",
      "But their victory was short-lived.",
      "The very next day, the men were placed on the first deportation flight back to Venezuela in over a year, according to their lawyer Jessica Vosburgh.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to imagine that it didn't have something to do with them filing a habeas petition and then stepping forward to challenge these threatened Guantanamo transfers,\u201d Vosburgh told ABC News. \u201cThe court's order only applied to transfers to Guant\u00e1namo, this is just a slap in the face to get deported the next day.\u201d",
      "While Vosburgh stopped short of calling the deportations retaliatory, she said she struggles to see what else could have led to the sudden deportation.",
      "\u201cWith thousands of other post-order Venezuelans detained in the United States awaiting removal, it is hard to imagine that petitioners would have been prioritized for these first deportation flights if they had not filed this habeas action, and courageously challenged the executive branch\u2019s reprehensible and legally unsupportable decision to begin shipping detained migrants to the notorious military prison at Guant\u00e1namo and holding them there incommunicado,\u201d Vosburgh argued in a court filing voluntarily dismissing the case.",
      "Vosburgh also called out the Trump administration for alleging that her clients -- two of whom have no criminal records, and one who was accused of a non-violent offense -- were members of the infamous Tren de Aragua gang, which could cause severe harm now that they are back in Venezuela where President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has linked the gang to his political opposition.",
      "\u201cRespondents\u2019 reckless labeling of these two Petitioners as gang-affiliated is part of a disturbing pattern, beginning on the Trump campaign trail, of scapegoating and criminalizing migrants who come to this country seeking protection and a better life,\u201d Vosburgh wrote. \u201cIt is also part of a trend, fueled by President Trump and his administration and supporters, of painting all Venezuelan migrant men as dangerous gang members deserving of being disappeared into the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d",
      "Vosburgh noted that her clients have safely made it to their homes and been reunited with their families, but the scars of their year-long incarceration remain.",
      "According to Vosburgh, each man endured \u201cdismal conditions\u201d that led them to suffer depression and suicidal ideation. One of the men was admitted into a psychiatric facility last month after he tried to hurt himself, according to the filing.",
      "\u201cPetitioners were needlessly separated for many months from their loved ones in the United States\u2014including Mr. Rivas Gonzalez\u2019s young daughter, who he has not been able to hold in his arms for half of her life. Their separation may now be permanent. It is deeply regrettable and an affront to justice that Petitioners had to suffer so much and for so long,\u201d the filing said.",

      "As DOGE acknowledges, only a portion of their records have been disclosed.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, tasked by President Donald Trump with slashing the federal government, claims that so far its cuts have saved the American public $55 billion in federal funds -- but it's not yet possible to verify how much DOGE has cut and what exactly it's cutting because, as DOGE acknowledges, only a portion of the contracts allegedly terminated as part of its operation has been disclosed.",
      "DOGE this week posted on its website a list of more than 1,000 federal contracts it says it has terminated, to go along with additional cuts it says it's made through fraud detection, asset sales, grant cancellations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.",
      "The 1,127 contracts span 39 federal departments and agencies, totaling roughly $8.6 billion of the $55 billion DOGE says it has cut.",
      "The largest contract DOGE initially said it had cut was an $8 billion agreement for \"Equal Employment Opportunity\" services -- but the amount of the contract, as listed on the DOGE website, was revised on Wednesday from $8 billion down to $8 million.",
      "The contract, from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, was originally capped at $8 billion on paper when it was first awarded to consulting firm D&G Support Services in 2022 as a blanket purchase agreement through 2027.",
      "Last month, on Jan. 28, the contract -- described as \"Program and Technical Support Services for Office of Diversity and Civil Rights (ODCR)\" -- was modified to change its cap from $8 billion to $8 million, citing \"OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION\" without offering any other details.",
      "On Jan. 29, the contract was \"partially\" terminated, citing the administration's effort to terminate \"all DEIA related services\" related to then-President Joe Biden's 2021 Executive Order 14035. On Jan. 30, the contract was fully terminated, citing the same reason.",
      "It's unclear if the revision to the contract's value on DOGE's website, from $8 billion to $8 million, affects DOGE's claim of $55 billion saved. As originally listed, the $8 billion accounted for more than half of the savings DOGE claimed through the termination of contracts.",
      "D&G CEO Leah Sanders told ABC News in a statement that the contract's value was $8 million.",
      "\"D&G Support Services (DBA D&G Solutions) acknowledges that the previously reported contract value of $8 billion was incorrect,\" the statement said. \"This discrepancy appears to have resulted from a clerical error in the original government filing upon contract award. The contract value had a ceiling of $8 million.\"",
      "Since September 2022, D&G has been awarded $2.5 million under the contract, according to federal spending data. On its website, D&G lists dozens of federal clients, including ICE, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Coastal Guard, the U.S. Army and the Department of Energy.",
      "Representatives for DOGE did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "DOGE acknowledges on its website that it is still working to post the full list of its contracts it has terminated, and that, for some data, \"there are likely some errors or omissions.\" It further says that only 20% of its \"savings\" are currently reflected on the site.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:14:37 -0500",
    "summary": "A law firm representing Elon Musk and Tesla helped draft a bill some experts say could, if passed, possibly restore Musk's lost multibillion-dollar compensation package.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are split on whether the bill could revive Musk's compensation deal.",
      "A law firm representing Elon Musk and Tesla helped draft legislation to overhaul Delaware's corporate law amid an ongoing court battle over Musk's multibillion-dollar compensation package from his electric car company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",
      "The proposed state legislation would amend the Delaware General Corporation Law to ease the rules that determine whether a shareholder is deemed a \"controller,\" a designation that blocked Musk from receiving a compensation plan of up to $55.8 billion from Tesla last year.",
      "Musk lost his compensation package -- reportedly the largest CEO compensation plan in public corporation history -- after being recognized as a \"controller\" of Tesla even though he held less than a third of the company's shares.",
      "Under the existing law, shareholders below the one-third threshold still receive the \"controller\" classification if they exert other avenues of control. In contrast, the proposed law would set a requirement that a shareholder hold at least a third of a company's shares in order to be deemed a \"controller.\"",
      "Legal experts are divided on whether the proposed legislation, if enacted, could impact Musk's Tesla compensation package currently on appeal to the state's Supreme Court -- a point of contention that has arisen from the fact the bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding its application to pending cases.",
      "The law firm representing Musk and Tesla, Richards, Layton & Finger, confirmed to ABC News its involvement in drafting the legislation. The firm claimed the legislation, if enacted, would not be retroactive and suggested it would not impact Musk's case.",
      "The firm also said that its role in the process \"was not on behalf of or otherwise influenced by any firm client,\" stressing that it was among a group of lawyers, professors and experts that helped draft the proposal and that the firm has played a major role in shaping Delaware's business statutes for more than 125 years.",
      "\"As many have recognized, statutory changes are necessary to restore the core principles that have been the hallmark of Delaware for over a century and ensure that Delaware remains the preeminent jurisdiction for incorporation,\" Richards, Layton & Finger President Lisa Schmidt wrote in a statement to ABC News.",
      "The bill's sponsor, Delaware Democratic state Sen. Bryan Townsend, echoed the claim, telling ABC News that the bill is \"not retroactive and would not affect the litigation regarding Elon Musk's compensation package at Tesla.\"",
      "Townsend also stressed that an attorney from Richards, Layton & Finger was invited to advise on the legislation as an industry expert and a member of the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Council, along with many other experts -- and that legislators were fully responsible for the bill's final draft.",
      "But other legal experts told ABC News that the proposed law could allow the Delaware court to reverse its decision and grant Musk the pay package.",
      "The bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding application to pending cases, making possible a court finding that alters the outcome of Musk's case, legal experts said.",
      "\"It's possible,\" Sarath Sanga, a professor of corporate law at Yale University, said of the potential use of the proposed law to revive Musk's pay package. \"There's nothing in the law requiring it and there's nothing preventing it.\"",
      "Ann Lipton, a law professor at Tulane University, said the absence of any stipulation preventing application to pending cases could function as a signal to the court to reverse its decision about Musk's pay.",
      "\"It sends a strong signal to the Delaware Supreme Court that we want you to interpret this to give Elon his pay package back,\" Lipton said.",
      "Boston College Law Professor Brian Quinn said that it's unclear if the legislation will be retroactive or not -- but added, \"It's entirely possible that the court reverses the trial opinion for reasons not related to this amendment, and the package is reinstated.\"",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees the Delaware trial court that handles commercial litigation, rejected the 2018 compensation package that Tesla voted to provide to Musk.",
      "McCormick found that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and Musk's influence over the negotiations.",
      "The proposed changes to the law could ease the scrutiny applied to Musk, resulting in a reversal of the court's judgment, some experts told ABC News.",
      "The proposed law bypassed a typical process of consideration before the Corporate Law Council, a section of the Delaware Bar Association, Sanga said. He said he could not recall an instance in which a proposed change to Delaware corporate law did not go through that process.",

Yes, grief is probably the biggest one,\" the woman told ABC News, adding that the FDA was her first job. \"I probably told my friends and family that I was a lifer in the federal government, like I had found the place that I wanted to build my career because I found such purpose in being able to protect Americans and our food supply.\"",
      "Katie Reichard, carrying her 6-month-old baby in the freezing cold, told ABC News she oversaw research to help address the drug overdose crisis before she was fired from HHS for being a probationary worker.",
      "\"There's a higher risk the money isn't getting to the communities that need it most, and the research won't be done,\" Reichard said, adding that her team ensured \"there isn't any waste, fraud or abuse, and now, they're taking away the people that oversee that.\"",
      "Reichard said her team was already understaffed before the firings began.",

      "Instead of making the government more efficient, Overby said the cuts are having the opposite effect.",
      "\"We're losing probably at this point, days, weeks, months just trying to scramble to respond to what's happened. And that's all the time,\" she said. \"We're not actually protecting the public and reviewing the safety of food.\"",

      "The heads of four major labor unions are calling on President Donald Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other \u201cstrong penalties\u201d against China for its increasing dominance",
      "WASHINGTON -- The heads of four major labor unions on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other \u201cstrong penalties\u201d against China for its increasing dominance in that sphere.",
      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority. But many of his concerns have been directed at U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he has imposed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China due to its role in making the opioid fentanyl.",
      "In January, Trump floated the possibility of more shipbuilding in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio talk show host.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build ships anymore,\" Trump said. \"We want to get that started. And maybe we\u2019ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.\u201d",
      "In a Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump noted the decline in American shipbuilding and indicated he wanted that to change.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build the way we used to build. Yeah, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is like a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get this country back on track.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:17:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge denied an urgent request to temporarily block Elon Musk and DOGE from firing employees or accessing records from a half a dozen government agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Fourteen state attorneys general were seeking a temporary restraining order.",
      "A federal judge in Washington on Tuesday denied an urgent request to block Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from firing employees or accessing sensitive records from a half a dozen government agencies.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan -- who previously oversaw President Donald Trump's criminal election interference case -- said the states didn't show that immediate irreparable harm would result, noting that the court cannot act based on media reports.",
      "\"Plaintiffs ask the court to take judicial notice of widespread media reports that DOGE has taken or will soon take certain actions, such as mass terminations.\" But these reports cannot substitute for \"specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint\" that \"clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result,\" Judge Chutkan wrote.",
      "Fourteen state attorneys general were seeking a temporary restraining order that would block DOGE from firing employees or accessing data from the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, Transportation, Commerce, and Office of Personnel Management as part of Trump's campaign promise to slash the federal government.",
      "The 14 states last week filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Musk's \"expansive authority\" is in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which calls for anyone deemed a \"principal officer\" of the U.S. government to be formally nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "While Tuesday's ruling handed the administration a short-term win, Judge Chutkan appeared sympathetic to the states' argument that Musk's role is potentially unconstitutional.",
      "Chutkan noted that if the allegations about the breadth of Musk's power prove true, his actions are \"precisely the 'Executive abuses' that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight,\" the judge wrote, saying she found the argument is legally plausible should they provide more evidence of Musk's actions.",
      "\"Musk has rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the Executive Branch,\" Chutkan wrote. \"Even Defendants concede there is no apparent 'source of legal authority granting [DOGE] the power' to take some of the actions challenged here.\"",
      "At Monday's hearing, Chutkan sharply questioned why the government lawyers appeared to have few details about DOGE's overall conduct, including the number of firings across the federal government to date.",
      "\"The firing of thousands of federal employees is not a small or common thing. You haven't been able to confirm that?\" Chutkan asked the attorneys. \"I think it will be very relevant to me to know whether thousands of federal employees have been terminated on Friday.\"",
      "Chutkan noted that what she called DOGE's \"unpredictable and scattershot\" tactics made it harder for the state attorneys general to prove a concrete, immediate harm -- though she acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations levied by state attorneys general.",
      "\"DOGE appears to be moving in no sort of predictable and orderly fashion,\" Chutkan said. \"This is essentially a private citizen directing an organization that's not a federal agency to have access to the entire workings of the federal government, fire, hire, slash, contract, terminate programs, all without apparently any congressional oversight.\"",
      "The states' lawsuit is one of at least 73 suits that have been filed challenging Trump's executive actions in his first month back in office, with many of them resulting in temporary restraining orders.",
      "Over the last week, courts have ruled that DOGE is temporarily barred from accessing sensitive Treasury Department information and payment systems; that agencies that maintain public health data must restore their websites and databases; that the State Department must pause the implementation of Trump's sweeping 90-day foreign aid freeze and the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and that the National Institutes of Health cannot reduce their cap on indirect funding for research, nor can the federal government withhold any federal funding because a health care entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical service to a minor.",
      "While the Trump administration notched some other wins in court last week -- including rulings allowing DOGE to continue accessing some sensitive records and giving the green light for an unprecedented federal buyout -- the president and his allies like Musk and Vice President JD Vance have begun floating the idea of pushing back on the courts.",
      "\"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Trump wrote on social media over the weekend.",
      "Over the weekend, the Trump administration, in an application to the Supreme Court, lambasted the series of legal setbacks the president has faced, telling the high court that the lower court rulings \"irreparably harm the Presidency by curtailing the President's ability to manage the Executive Branch in the earliest days of his Administration.\"",
      "\"The district court's order exemplifies a broader, weeks-long trend in which plaintiffs challenging President Trump's initiatives have persuaded district courts to issue TROs that intrude upon a host of the President's Article II powers,\" wrote Solicitor General Sarah Harris.",
      "The rapid pace of litigation is set to continue with at least eight separate cases scheduled to have court hearings this week.",

    "story": [
      "Clinton reduced the federal workforce by more than 377,000 employees.",
      "In an attempt to defend the Department of Government Efficiency's controversial moves, Elon Musk is likening the aggressive government overhaul to a Clinton-era task force that oversaw a shrinking of the federal workforce.",
      "\"Sounds familiar,\" Musk wrote in one X post over the weekend in response to a 40-minute compilation video of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore talking about their effort to modernize the government.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made the same argument on Fox News on Monday, saying the administration is doing what \"Democrat politicians promised the American people they would do for decades.\"",
      "But policy experts, including some involved in the Clinton initiative, emphasize there are big differences between then and now.",
      "Led by Vice President Gore, the task force delivered a report to Clinton with more than 380 recommendations to reform the government, following his directives to make the government \"both less expensive and more efficient,\" and to \"change the culture of our national bureaucracy away from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment.\"",
      "Within weeks of his inauguration, he signed an executive order calling on agencies to cut 100,000 jobs over three years, with 10% or more coming from high-level federal workers. In 1994, Clinton signed the bipartisan Federal Workforce Restructuring Act, which offered $25,000 to buyout non-Defense Department workers.",
      "By the end of his term, Clinton reduced the federal government's workforce by more than 377,000 employees. But that all unfolded over several years, and with the help of Congress.",
      "President Donald Trump and DOGE, on the other hand, is approaching this faster and in a less targeted fashion than the Clinton administration. And unlike Clinton, Trump does not have broad bipartisan buy-in.",
      "\"In many ways it's very hard to compare, because what the Trump administration is doing is reinventing government upside down and inside out,\" said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.",
      "Kettl described the Musk-Trump approach as a \"bulldozer\" and likely modeled after Musk's leadership at X. Musk slashed the workforce at the social media giant by 80% after he took it over in 2022.",
      "\"But that's a pretty risky operation,\" Kettl said. \"It's one thing if your social media goes down, it's another thing when you're tinkering with air traffic control or food safety.\"",
      "In the month since Trump's inauguration, more than 200,000 federal workers at more than a dozen agencies have had their roles eliminated, according to ABC News. Firings have occurred at the Department of Energy, USAID, the Environmental Protection Agency and more.",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lamented dozens of Alaskans being put out of work, saying while she agreed with the goal to reduce the size of the government the \" his approach is bringing confusion, anxiety, and now trauma to our civil servants.\"",
      "\"Indiscriminate workforce cuts aren't efficient and won't fix the federal budget, but they will hurt good people who have answered the call to public service to do important work for our nation,\" Murkowski said.",
      "Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, voiced a similar concern: \"I think if there's one thing I could change about the DOGE, it's that it's moving so fast, it's not really factoring in the human element.\"",
      "Musk, in an interview with Trump that aired on Fox News on Tuesday night, said the goal of DOGE was to trim $1 trillion from the deficit.",
      "Clinton was able to balance the budget and cut the deficit but it wasn't just because of his workforce cuts or efficiency reforms, Kettl said. Clinton was buoyed by a booming economy as well as the implementation of tax increases and spending cuts.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic operative who led the Clinton initiative, told ABC News that Musk and DOGE have the benefit of advanced technology to reshape government but are moving too fast to produce the desired effects. Kamarck is currently a senior fellow in Governance Studies and the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution.",
      "\"If they weren't in such a hurry, the Trump people could leverage new AI technology to make government more effective,\" Kamarck said. \"But you can't do it with a blunderbuss and that's what they're doing.\"",
      "Musk defended DOGE's work in the Oval Office with Trump last week, contending the administration received a mandate from voters to push back on a sprawling federal bureaucracy and \"rightsize\" the government.",
      "Musk admitted the entity would make mistakes and \"nobody can bat 1,000.\"",
      "\"We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly,\" he said.",
      "Budget experts question DOGE's findings so far",
      "In interviews with ABC News, several budget experts praised DOGE's stated goals but questioned some of its alleged findings and cuts to the federal workforce. DOGE has claimed $55 billion in cuts, but the figure is difficult to verify and only some records have been disclosed.",
      "The experts also questioned whether the federal government will ultimately \"save\" any money from the cuts to programs -- some of which require congressional approval, setting up a potential impoundment fight.",
      "Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown's Government Affairs Institute, said it appears Musk and the Trump administration are conflating the concepts of government waste and fraud.",
      "\"There is actual fraud, and Musk has talked about some of it, if doctors are over-billing Medicare with phony patients, that is straight up fraud,\" he said. \"Having a disagreement with the previous administration is called reality.\"",
      "Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, and the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told ABC News that Trump's definition of fraud \"is in the eye of the beholder.\"",
      "\"They flagged some things that they think are silly or terrible but other people may think are valuable programs. Those become political footballs and their defenders in Congress make it harder for them to do reductions,\" he said.",
      "To meet Musk's ambitious goal to cut $1 trillion in spending, the White House will have to aim higher than USAID programs and \"haphazard and random\" cuts to the federal workforce, Holtz-Eakin added.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending you have to reform the big programs. Social Security, Medicare are over half of all monetary spending in the next ten years,\" he said."

      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",

      "NEW YORK -- Justice Department lawyers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are set to face a federal judge who is signaling that he\u2019s unlikely to rubber stamp their request to drop the mayor's corruption charges weeks before an April trial.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho in Manhattan scheduled the Wednesday afternoon hearing after three government lawyers from Washington made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so.",
      "Ho already indicated that the hearing was likely to be only an initial step when he wrote in an order Tuesday that one subject on the agenda will be a discussion of \u201cprocedure for resolution of the motion.\u201d",
      "Also set for discussion are the reasons for the request to dismiss the indictment against the Democrat that charges the first-term mayor with accepting over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Early last week, Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York in a memo to drop the charges because the prosecution \u201chas unduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d He said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election.",
      "Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying Bove's request to drop charges in return for assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she \"will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cDismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams\u2019s mayoral decision-making would be all three,\u201d Sassoon, a Republican, said of what she called a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d deal as she offered to resign. She also said prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams.",
      "Bove responded to Sassoon with apparent anger, accepting her resignation and accusing her of \u201cpursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.\u201d He then informed her that two prosecutors assigned to the case were suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they keep their jobs.",
      "If either of those prosecutors wished to comply with his directive to dismiss charges, he welcomed them to do so, but Hagan Scotten quit the following day, writing in a resignation letter that he supported Sassoon's actions.",
      "Scotten wrote to Bove that it would take a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201ccoward\u201d to meet his demand to drop the charges, \u201cbut it was never going to be me.\u201d",
      "In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department in Washington, had resigned by Friday.",
      "Since then, a small army of former prosecutors have gotten behind the defiant stand by Sassoon and other prosecutors.",
      "On Friday, seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon\u2019s \u201ccommitment to integrity and the rule of law.\u201d",
      "On Monday, three former U.S. attorneys from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut submitted papers to Ho suggesting that he appoint a special prosecutor if he finds the Justice Department acted improperly or that he order all evidence be made available to state and local prosecutors.",
      "A former Watergate prosecutor filed papers separately, telling the judge to reject the government's request and consider assigning a special counsel to explore the legal issues and ultimately consider appointing an independent special prosecutor to try the case.",
      "Also Monday, Justice Connection, an organization advocating for Justice Department employees, released a letter signed by over 900 former federal prosecutors to career federal prosecutors that said they have \u201cwatched with alarm\u201d as values \u201cfoundational to a fair and justice legal system\u201d have been tested.",
      "In the letter, the former prosecutors said they \u201csalute and admire the courage many of you have already exhibited. You have responded to ethical challenges of a type no public servant should ever be forced to confront with principle and conviction, in the finest traditions of the Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for the mayor, wrote to the judge, saying those who believed that Adams struck a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with prosecutors were wrong.",
      "\u201cThere was no quid pro quo. Period,\u201d he said."

      "The new head of the Social Security Administration says deceased centenarians are \u201cnot necessarily receiving benefits.\"",
      "WASHINGTON -- The new head of the Social Security Administration said Wednesday that deceased centenarians are \u201cnot necessarily receiving benefits,\" contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over the age of 100 are getting payments from the agency.",
      "Lee Dudek, the new acting SSA commissioner who was placed in the role by President Donald Trump, gave the clarification after Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk falsely claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "While it is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people, the numbers thrown out by Trump and Musk are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security\u2019s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, issued a news release Wednesday reiterating the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the note acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "He seemed to confirm that confusion had arisen because of the default settings on the database.",
      "\u201cThe reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,\" he said.",
      "\u201cI am confident that with DOGE\u2019s help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\u201d Dudek said.",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority. But many of his concerns have been directed at U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he has imposed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China due to its role in making the opioid fentanyl.",

      "In a Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump noted the decline in American shipbuilding and indicated he wanted that to change.",

      "The move is designed to give President Donald Trump an early policy win and put pressure on House Republicans to join rather than pursue a separate, more comprehensive effort that also risks taking far longer to pass, if at all.",

      "The budget resolution, authored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, sets the stage for about $342 billion in increased spending on border security, defense and the Coast Guard.",
      "Graham said the spending would take place over four years and be paid for with reduced spending elsewhere in the federal government, though the resolution itself does not specify how those cuts would occur.",
      "The budget resolution advanced out of committee last week on a party-line vote. It directs the Senate Homeland Security Committee to increase spending by up to $175 billion, the Senate Armed Services Committee to spend up to $150 billion more and the Senate Commerce panel to increase spending by about $20 billion.

      "Once a budget plan is approved, committees would draft legislation consistent with their instructions to find savings or increase spending in programs under their jurisdiction. But the formal work needed to advance those recommendations can't take place until both the House and Senate pass identical budget plans.",
      "At some point, Republicans in the House and Senate will have to resolve their differences for them to use the tool that will allow the package to pass with a simple majority in the Senate and sidestep a Democratic filibuster. For now, they are competing with each other to win Trump's favor.",
      "The House does have momentum for its efforts after a few weeks of delay. The chamber's Budget panel has advanced its more comprehensive budget plan to the floor on a party-line vote. Speaker Mike Johnson's office said it will come up for a vote in the full chamber next week when the House returns to Washington.",

That all leads up to an expected all-night session Thursday with rapid-fire attempts to amend the package in what's typically called a \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d",
      "The Republican package would allow $175 billion to be spent on border security, including money for mass deportation operations and building the U.S.-Mexico border wall, in addition to a $150 billion boost to the Pentagon and $20 billion for the Coast Guard.",
      "Trump border czar Tom Homan and top aide Stephen Miller told senators privately last week that they are running short of cash to accomplish the president's immigration and deportation priorities, spurring Republicans to move swiftly.",
      "Eyeing ways to pay for it, Republican senators are considering a rollback of the Biden administration\u2019s methane emissions fee, which was approved by Democrats as part of climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and hoping to draw new revenue from energy leases as they aim to spur domestic energy production.",
      "But all that was in jeopardy when Trump said early Wednesday he wanted the House\u2019s version passed as a way to \u201ckickstart\u201d the process and \u201cmove all of our priorities to the concept of, \u2018ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump said, \u201cUnlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\u201d",
      "The Senate\u2019s Republican leadership was blindsided by the post.",
      "\u201cAs they say, I did not see that one coming,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Thune had engineered the two-bill approach as a way to deliver an early victory for the White House and had pushed the Senate forward while the House is away on recess this week, saying it was time to act.",
      "By lunchtime, after Vance met with the senators, his message was for them to simply carry on.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said afterward that Vance told them: \u201cThe president wants whatever you guys want. Just do whatever you want. He\u2019s going to support it.\"",
      "Cramer said Trump enjoys watching the House and Senate compete over his agenda.",
      "The House GOP bill is multiple times larger, with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.5 trillion in spending reductions over the decade across Medicaid health care programs, food stamps and other services used by large swaths of the country. The cuts could ultimately grow to $2 trillion to appease hard-right conservatives.",
      "The budget plans are being considered under what's called the reconciliation process, which allows passage on a simple majority vote without many of the procedural hurdles that stall legislation. Once rare, reconciliation is increasingly being used in the House and Senate to pass big packages on party-line votes when one party controls the White House and Congress.",
      "During Trump's first term, Republicans used the reconciliation process to pass GOP tax cuts in 2017. Democrats used reconciliation during the Biden presidency era to approve COVID relief and the Inflation Reduction Act."

      "An Internal Revenue Service agent has been acquitted of involuntary manslaughter of a U.S. officer in the shooting death of a fellow agent after a training session at an Arizona gun range",
      "PHOENIX -- An Internal Revenue Service agent was acquitted Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter of a U.S. officer in the shooting death of a fellow agent after a training session at an Arizona gun range.",
      "Prosecutors said Larry Edward Brown Jr. handled his gun with reckless disregard for human life when he shot IRS Special Agent Patrick Bauer on Aug. 17, 2023.",
      "Brown, who cried when the verdict was announced, offered his \u201csincerest condolences to the Bauer family\u201d in a statement issued through his attorneys. \u201cPat was a great man,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe was a mentor and like a brother to me. I miss him every day.\u201d",
      "Outside the courtroom, several of Bauer\u2019s loved ones sobbed and one woman threw her purse at the wall.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona, which prosecuted the case, said in a statement, \u201cWe remain supportive of Agent Bauer\u2019s family in this difficult time, proud of our team for seeking justice, and respectful of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Jurors deliberated for about an hour and 45 minutes before delivering the verdict.",
      "The shooting occurred in a one-room building at a gun range at the Federal Correctional Institution in Phoenix, where Bauer had just finished overseeing standard live-fire pistol qualification exercises. Sixteen IRS criminal investigators, who examine violations of tax, money laundering and other federal laws, had taken part in the pistol qualification and classroom exercises at the complex.",
      "After the session ended, another IRS agent left the building to get his phone and heard a gunshot seconds later. The indictment says the agent saw Brown, a defensive tactics instructor, running out and yelling that he had messed up and shot Bauer, who died during surgery. He had been shot in the upper torso. No one else was in the building at the time.",
      "After the shooting, Brown was taken to a different medical center, where he was diagnosed with an acute stress reaction. While at the hospital, the indictment alleged, Brown repeatedly said out loud, \u201cI am a use of force instructor. I should know better.\u201d FBI Agent Taylor Hannah has been identified in court records as the person who said she heard Brown make that comment, but Brown\u2019s lawyers said their client never said those words.",
      "Prosecutors said Bauer\u2019s death was preventable. They said Brown violated fundamental firearms safety rules, such as always treating a gun as if it\u2019s loaded, keeping its muzzle pointed in a safe direction and refraining from touching its trigger until ready to fire.",
      "Brown pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said Bauer\u2019s death was a terrible accident, that the agents were friends and that Brown came to Bauer\u2019s aid, including by calling 911, forming a chest seal to maintain the function of Bauer's lungs, and asking other federal officers at the complex for help.",
      "Dr. Kenji Inaba, a medical expert hired on behalf of Brown, said in a report that Bauer would have more likely than not survived his injuries had he been taken to the hospital sooner.",
      "The ambulance that transported Bauer to the hospital left the scene about 25 minutes after the shooting, and it took another 14 minutes to get to the hospital, Inaba said.",
      "Inaba suggested federal agents who had medical training could have transported Bauer to the hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance in a location that doesn\u2019t have a trauma center nearby.",
      "Prosecutors said Bauer may still have died, even with standard care and no delays. They said Bauer was killed by a bullet negligently fired from Brown\u2019s gun, not by medical negligence."

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:58:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d"

      "Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register on Tuesday in connection with a Feb. 8 editorial titled \u201cSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.\" The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the City Council held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous that a judge would issue a temporary restraining order without a hearing,\u201d said Wyatt Emmerich, president of the paper's parent company, Emmerich Newspapers. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight it and see where it goes.\u201d",
      "The city's lawsuit called the editorial libelous and said it \u201cchilled and hindered\u201d the city's efforts to lobby for the tax with state legislators.",
      "The editorial was no longer available on the newspaper's website by Wednesday afternoon. Martin scheduled a Feb. 27 hearing in the case.",
      "Mayor Chuck Espy said the editorial unfairly implied that the city had broken the law with its meeting and cited another portion that questioned, \u201cHave commissioners or the mayor gotten kick-backs from the community?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all for the press doing their job. We\u2019re all for as much transparency as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cJust tell the truth. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask for.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is a rather astounding order and we feel it is egregious and chilling,\u201d said Layne Bruce, executive director of the Mississippi Press Association. \u201cIt clearly runs afoul of the First Amendment and we fully support the Press Register\u2019s right to report and offer commentary on the business of Clarksdale\u2019s city government.\u201d",
      "Lisa Zycherman, vice president of legal programs at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the order \"constitutes censorship and is unquestionably a serious First Amendment violation.\u201d",
      "There have been other attempts to silence news outlets in recent years. In 2023, a Kansas police department raided a newspaper's office and the home of its owner and publisher after claiming the paper and a reporter potentially committed identity theft and other computer crimes in obtaining and verifying information about a local business owner\u2019s driving record. The raid was later investigated and the former police chief who led it was charged last year with obstruction of justice."

      "The Trump administration has suspended a program that helped children who come to the U.S. without a parent or guardian navigate the immigration court system",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Children so young their feet can't touch the floor when they sit in courtroom chairs have been left without representation in immigration court because of Trump administration cuts, according to organizations that help these kids navigate the legal system when they arrive in the U.S. without a parent or guardian.",
      "The organizations say the children are at risk because the Trump administration suspended a key program late Tuesday, ordering that the Acacia Center for Justice and its subcontractors immediately stop work on a $200 million contract to provide representation for children entering the country alone.",
      "Daniela Hernandez, an immigration attorney who provides free legal services to about 60 children in Pasadena, California, said during a news conference Wednesday that some of her clients \u2014 who are as young as 2 \u2014 have court hearings as soon as Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat is this 2-year-old client supposed to do without her attorney?\" she said. \"Who will speak for her in court? Who will explain to her and all of our other clients in foster care who have not only nobody, no adult in the United States to care for them, that they will now have to navigate a very complex legal immigration system on their own?\u201d",
      "The Interior Department gave no explanation for the stop-work order, telling the group only that it was done for \u201ccauses outside of your control\u201d and should not be interpreted as a judgment of poor performance. The halt remains in effect until further notice.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the department said it has agreements to support other agencies but does not fund or operate the program and couldn't answer questions about it. The Department of Health and Human Services Department, which oversees unaccompanied migrant children, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "At a San Diego immigration court Wednesday, a 5-year-old girl from Mexico facing deportation sat before Judge Olga Attia. Attia asked if the girl could have some coloring books \u2014 \u201cthat may be a little more fun,\u201d she told her.",
      "As the girl drew, the judge explained the case to her, her 13-year-old sister and her 15-year-old brother. All three children were arrested for crossing the border illegally, without their parents, in March 2024. Their mother attended the hearing -- she entered the U.S. at a different time than her children, who have their own immigration cases.",
      "And they were navigating it all without a lawyer.",
      "The mother said they couldn't afford one. Attia recommended a nonprofit that might give guidance and scheduled another hearing in May.",
      "But with the contract that was ended Tuesday, options for affordable legal guidance are narrowing for this family and thousands of others involving unaccompanied children.",
      "Acacia has a network of 85 organizations nationwide that work with children under 18. About 26,000 migrant children get direct legal representation under the contract while roughly 100,000 get some kind of legal advice, often through presentations lawyers hold for children while they are in government-run shelters just after arriving in the U.S.",
      "People fighting deportation do not have the same right to representation as people going through criminal courts, although they can hire private attorneys.",
      "But there has been some recognition that children navigating the immigration court system without a parent or guardian are especially vulnerable.",
      "The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 created special protections for children who arrive in the U.S. without a parent or a legal guardian. It said the government should facilitate legal representation for the children put into deportation proceedings, though it did not mandate every child have a lawyer.",
      "Acacia and its subcontractors recruit and train lawyers and work with private attorneys who provide free legal representation for the children.",
      "Unaccompanied children can request asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas for victims of sexual exploitation. Most of the children don\u2019t speak English and need interpreters.",
      "\u201cYou have these kids who are thrust into this adult-like situation with very severe consequences,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, citing that about 50% of children have legal representation in immigration court.",
      "Children will be stuck in the system or off the grid, and cases won't be processed, attorneys and experts said.",
      "Melissa L. Lopez is executive director of a group that receives funding through the program that was suspended, and she said they have a legal and ethical obligation to continue helping the estimated 2,000 children they represent.",
      "\u201cWe will do what is best for our clients,\u201d said Lopez, of El Paso, Texas-based Estrella del Paso. The group also gives legal presentations in shelters so children know their rights, but they've been barred from doing that, she said.",
      "\u201cThey will be expected to go to court alone and uninformed,\u201d she said.",

      "The move, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump, names Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The designation will be published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register, according to a notice Wednesday.",

      "According to minutes of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, which were released Wednesday, Fed officials said that President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, were factors that could push inflation higher this year.",
      "The Fed's 19 officials who participate in its interest-rate decisions indicated that \u201cthey would want to see further progress on inflation before making\u201d any further cuts. They kept the Fed's key rate at 4.3%, after cutting it from a two-decade high of 5.3% late last year. The Fed's pause makes it less likely that borrowing costs for consumers, including for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, will decline anytime soon.",
      "Just last week, the government released data that suggested inflation was actually getting worse, leading many economists to forecast just one \u2014 if any \u2014 rate cut this year. Consumer prices rose 3% in January from a year ago, the Labor Department said, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% last September. The Fed, however, more closely follows a separate inflation measure that is shows inflation is closer to 2.5%.",
      "The minutes also cited a \u201chigh degree of uncertainty\u201d surrounding the economy, which made it appropriate for the Fed to \u201ctake a careful approach\u201d in considering any further changes to its key interest rate.",
      "All of the Fed's policymakers supported keeping its key rate unchanged last month, the minutes said. The unanimity comes after signs of a growing disagreement in recent months between those officials who supported further rate reductions and those more worried about stubborn inflation.",
      "A key issue, particularly on Wall Street, is how long the Fed\u2019s pause on rate cuts will last. Wall Street investors expect the central bank won\u2019t cut again until July, according to futures prices. They don\u2019t forecast a second cut until 2026.",
      "Many Fed officials have also said they want to see how Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs and immigration crackdown affect the economy. Most economists forecast that the tariffs will push up inflation, though some also argue that Trump\u2019s promises to reduce regulation could lower consumer prices over time.",
      "On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said in a speech in Australia that he still expects rates to come down this year, but for now he supports a pause.",
      "Waller said that if the inflation uptick last month turns out to be a blip, as it did in January 2024, \u201crate cuts would be appropriate at some point this year.\u201d",
      "Waller also said that he didn't think new tariffs would significantly raise inflation, and added that any increase in prices would likely be temporary. As a result, he said the Fed shouldn't necessarily change its policies because of tariffs.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t altered my outlook based on what has been implemented to date,\u201d he said, referring to Trump's tariff announcements."

      "Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful to his family and supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota, one day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in...",
      "BELCOURT, N.D. -- Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the showing and support you\u2019ve given me,\" Peltier said. \"I\u2019ve got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior can\u2019t be up crying in front of his people.\u201d",
      "Then-President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.",
      "FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement.",
      "For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier \u201ca remorseless killer\u201d who should remain in prison.",
      "In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans.",
      "For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: \u201cI spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do.\u201d",
      "Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support.",
      "\u201cFrom day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country,\u201d Peltier said.",
      "Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington, D.C., and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder.",
      "Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up \u201cagainst the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people.\"",
      "\"All around the world, Leonard Peltier\u2019s name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious.\"",
      "Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans.",
      "\u201cWhat I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home,\u201d Azure said.",

      "It is affecting more than just the national capital region, home to about 20% of the 2.4 million members of the civilian federal workforce, which does not include military personnel and postal employees workers. More than 80% of that workforce lives outside the Washington area.",
      "There is no official figure available of the total firings or layoffs. The Associated Press tallied how agencies are being affected based on AP reporting and statements from lawmakers and employee unions.",
      "Here is a look at some of the broad and specific ways federal agencies and employees are being affected by the administration's reductions, as of Wednesday:",

      "But just before that deadline, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s plan, wanting to hear arguments from the administration and the labor unions, which said the offer was illegal.",
      "According to the Office of Personnel Management, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the offer as of Feb. 12.",
      "There have also been wide-ranging layoffs of probationary employees \u2014 those generally on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. Potentially hundreds of thousands are affected.",
      "On Feb. 13, the administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all such workers. According to government data maintained by OPM, 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job as of March 2024.",
      "On Feb. 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the dismissal of more than 1,000 employees who had served for less than two years. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.",
      "At least 39 people have been fired from the Education Department, including special education specialists and student aid officials, according to a union that represents agency workers.",
      "There have also been nearly $900 million in cuts to the department's Institute of Education Services, which tracks the progress of America\u2019s students. It is unclear to what degree the institute would continue to exist. Industry experts said at least 169 contracts were terminated Feb. 10.",
      "Hundreds of federal employees tasked with working on the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs were laid off Feb. 13, but that move was largely rescinded hours later, according to a memo obtained by the AP. Three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said as many as 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were ousted, with some losing access to email before they had learned they were fired.",
      "The cuts include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1,300 probationary employees \u2014 roughly one-tenth of the agency\u2019s total workforce \u2014 are being forced out. The Atlanta-based agency\u2019s leadership was notified of the decision Feb. 14, according to a federal official who was at the meeting and was not authorized to discuss the orders and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The probationary cuts included more than 130 employees at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including the federal efforts to secure election systems. It is not clear whether those included 17 employees who had worked on election security and had already been placed on leave.",
      "Four employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 its chief financial officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist \u2014 were fired Feb. 11 over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants.",
      "The IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two people familiar with the agency\u2019s plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It is unclear how many IRS workers will be affected or when the cuts will happen.",
      "The administration has fired about 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees who maintain and clean parks, educate visitors and perform other functions.",
      "The firings were not publicly announced but were confirmed by Democratic senators and House members. Adding to the confusion, the park service now says it is reinstating about 5,000 seasonal jobs that were initially rescinded last month.",
      "Seasonal workers are routinely added during the warm-weather months to serve more than 325 million annual visitors who descend on the nation\u2019s 428 parks, historic sites and other attractions.",
      "The administration has ordered the agency \u2014 created after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal \u2014 to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting it down.",
      "The new agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Feb. 14 that her agency had invited Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team with \u201copen arms\u201d and that layoffs \u201cwill be forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Trump swiftly ordered a halt to much of the aid that the United States sends abroad. Several weeks later, the pause is on pause.",
      "In his first week in office, Trump issued an executive order directing a 90-day hold on most of the foreign assistance disbursed through the State Department.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued several specific exemptions, including emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the freeze on foreign assistance. But thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide stopped work or prepared to do so.",
      "Without the money to pay staff, aid organizations including the U.S. Agency for International Development began laying off hundreds of employees. Crews removed the agency\u2019s signage from its Washington headquarters.",
      "But on Feb. 13, a federal judge considering some of the lawsuits challenging agency cuts ordered the administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze.",
      "The White House said last month it was pausing federal grants and loans as the Republican administration began an across-the-board ideological review.",
      "The freeze could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted.",
      "\u201cThe use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\u201d said a memo from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Democrats and independent organizations said the move was illegal because Congress had already authorized the funding.",
      "Each of the federal government\u2019s largest agencies has its own independent inspector general who is supposed to conduct objective audits, prevent fraud and promote efficiency.",
      "Trump has fired at least 17 of them, including watchdogs he appointed in his first term. At least one Democratic appointee, Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department, was spared.",
      "Trump told reporters that \u201cit\u2019s a very common thing to do\u201d and that he would \u201cput good people in there that will be very good.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s normal for politically appointed U.S. attorneys to be replaced, but it is not standard procedure for career prosecutors to be ousted with a change in administrations.",
      "The Justice Department said last month that it had fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal prosecutions of Trump by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has ordered a halt to New York City\u2019s congestion pricing system, which thins traffic and funds mass transit by imposing high tolls on drivers entering some parts of Manhattan",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered a halt to New York City\u2019s congestion pricing system, which thins traffic and funds mass transit by imposing high tolls on drivers entering some parts of Manhattan.",
      "Launched on Jan. 5, the city\u2019s system uses license plate readers to impose a $9 toll on most passenger cars entering Manhattan neighborhoods south of Central Park. In its early days, transit officials say the toll has brought modest but measurable traffic reductions.",
      "That charge comes on top of what drivers already pay to use bridges and tunnels to get onto the island. Drivers who take a tunnel in from New Jersey during peak commuting hours now pay $31.81, or a discounted rate of $22.06 if they are enrolled in the E-ZPass toll collection program.",
      "In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced the federal government has rescinded its approval of the program, calling it \u201cslap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners.\u201d Duffy said his agency will work with the state on an \u201corderly termination of the tolls.\u201d",
      "Similar tolling programs intended to force people onto public public transit by making driving cost-prohibitive have long existed in other global cities, including London, Stockholm, Milan and Singapore, but the system had never before been tried in the U.S.",
      "Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower penthouse and other properties are within the congestion zone, had vowed to kill the plan as soon as he took office. He previously characterized it as a massive, regressive tax.",
      "\u201cIt will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect,\u201d Trump said in November as New York prepared to implement the plan before he took office.",
      "Revenue from the tolls is intended to raise billions of dollars in revenue for the city\u2019s creaky and cash-strapped transit system, which carries some 4 million riders daily.",
      "The tolling system has been divisive. Transit advocates and environmentalists have heralded it as an innovative step to reduce air pollution from vehicle exhaust, make streets safer for pedestrians and bikers, while speeding up traffic for vehicles that truly need to be on the road, like delivery trucks and police cars.",
      "But the high tolls are hated by many New Yorkers who own cars, particularly those that live in the suburbs or parts of the city not well-served by the subway system.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, had fought the tolls and court and wrote a letter Trump on Inauguration Day imploring him to kill the program.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also had misgivings. Last June, she abruptly halted the tolling system\u2019s planned launch, citing concerns about its impact on the local economy. The Democrat then revived the toll in November following Trump\u2019s election, but reduced the toll for passenger vehicles from $15 to $9. Since then, she has lauded it as a win for the city and has discussed the issue multiple times with the president.",
      "The tolling plan was approved by New York lawmakers in 2019, but stalled for years awaiting a required federal environmental review during Trump\u2019s first term before being approved by the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "As in other cities, the New York congestion fee varies depending on the time and the size of the vehicle. Trucks and other large automobiles pay a higher rate, and the fee goes drops to $2.25 for most cars during the quieter overnight hours.",
      "The toll survived several lawsuits trying to halt it before its launch, including from the state of New Jersey, unionized teachers in New York City, a trucking industry group and local elected leaders in the Hudson River Valley, Long Island and northern New Jersey."

      "The release of the comments comes as the Fed faces criticism from Trump for not cutting interest rates sooner after leaving rates unchanged in the January meeting.",

    "summary": "The tech giant is hoping AI at a lower price can reinvigorate sales of its flagship piece of hardware.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has announced a new iPhone which brings artificial intelligence (AI) features at a lower cost than its flagship handsets.",
      "The iPhone 16e has the same processor as the larger iPhone 16, Apple said, with similar storage options, though a lower spec elsewhere, including fewer cameras.",
      "Apple has been struggling to find a new product that excites consumers - sales of iPhones dropped at the end of last year.",
      "It will be hoping that bringing enhanced AI functionality to a less expensive phone will address that - however analysts have been cautious about the sales boost such tools bring.",
      "Its name is clearly a nod to its iPhone SE series, which were released from 2016 to  2022, and similarly priced significantly lower.",
      "Apple said the iPhone 16e will be available for pre-order from February 21 in 59 countries",
      "It will launch in the UK for \u00a3599, which is \u00a3200 less than the iPhone 16 - but more than double what the original iPhone SE went for when it launched in 2016.",
      "\"This now becomes one of the most affordable powerful iPhones now on the market,\" industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told BBC News.",
      "\"The move should help accelerate adoption and especially its foray into AI with Apple Intelligence.",
      "\"Apple's trust and credibility is critical - this alone will help drive sales and lure users from rival devices and platforms.\"",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Much of the conversation around the new handset will likely centre around its power, with Apple electing to use the same A18 chip behind its more expensive devices.",
      "This means the 16e will be capable of playing the same games and running the same apps as other iPhones - though AI is likely at the heart of this decision.",
      "Apple boss Tim Cook said in the announcement the new model featured \"the performance, intelligence and privacy\" Apple fans \"expect\" from the firm.",
      "And he said the Apple Intelligence features on the device would \"help you save time, quickly get more things done, and express yourself in new ways\".",
      "The firm introduced its spin on the tech - Apple Intelligence - with this series of devices, which includes new tools for writing and incorporating OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT into Siri.",
      "It hasn't always gone well, with the firm at one point suspending its AI-generated news alerts after they created false headlines attributed to news organisations including the BBC.",
      "It now presents the summaries in italics.",
      "Apple said its new phone is \"built for Apple Intelligence\", and pointed to certain features of the tech, like an easy way to clean up photos or search your image library.",
      "Other phone manufacturers have similar features on their devices - though the iPhone 16e will be by far the cheapest way to access AI on an Apple handset.",
      "\"The iPhone 16e generates a new revenue stream for Apple, and this will be particularly noticeable in key markets like India, where iPhones are out of reach for most people,\" said Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "\"There is also a second-order effect of cheaper devices like the iPhone 16e, bringing new customers into the Apple ecosystem.",
      "\"We've seen a limited appetite among many of the installed base to upgrade from previous versions, but the new phone reduces the cost hurdle of joining the Apple Intelligence bandwagon.\"",
      "Apple's current offerings are also underwhelming in light of the company's prolific investments in research and development. Cory Johnson, Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist, said Apple has spent $189bn on R&D over the last decade alone.",
      "\"All we have to show for that is the HomePod and $3,500 ski goggles,\" Johnson said. \"AI should be right in Apple's wheelhouse. But Apple fanboys, fangirls, and investors are right to be disappointed so far.\""

    "summary": "It says a new chip it has created could end up being as important a breakthrough as the semiconductor.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",
      "Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers.",
      "\"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\"",

      "\"The long term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields.",
      "There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve.",
      "But these are problems quantum machines might be able to rapidly crack, promising new discoveries by creating new medicines or designing better batteries.",
      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",
      "However, it claims to have a path to scaling it up to a million qubits - which would create immense computing power.",
      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",
      "\"This is promising progress after more than a decade of challenges, and the next few years will see whether this exciting roadmap pans out,\" he said."

      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",

      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",

      "The predicted rise will come as the days get lighter and warmer, when energy use tends to fall.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 03:50:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",

      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "Mr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".",
      "\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"",

      "Alongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.",
      "A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers.

    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",

      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

      "Welsh government guidance states the use, or threatened use, of an offensive weapon, can be considered an exceptional circumstance where the learner can be permanently excluded.",
      "Mr Myers said: \"On more than one occasion, as a school we had the conversation with the local authority to explain someone was carrying a knife and this is what we would like to do... the response from the local authority was 'no, we are not going to support you excluding that person permanently'.\"",

      "\"We've got our behaviour summit coming up where we're going to have an action focused look at what we need to do,\" Neagle said.",
      "\"We're developing a behaviour toolkit for schools to help schools to manage challenging behaviour [and] we also have strong guidance in place on what can be reasons for exclusion and, currently, having a knife in school can be a reason for automatic exclusion.\"",
      "Mr Myers initially expressed concerns to the Welsh government about vapes, behaviour and what he describes as a lack of clarity in government guidelines for addressing it.",
      "He was particularly concerned about the difference between the powers in Wales and England to search pupils for prohibited items.",
      "\"We absolutely haven't been sleeping at the wheel and I've seen correspondence from the gentleman that referred to teachers being able to search for vapes and drugs and they can already undertake those searches with consent,\" said Neagle.",
      "\"But as I've said our guidance is very clear on the issue of knives. They can be a cause for immediate exclusion. In relation to what happened at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, obviously my heart goes out to everybody at the school.\"",

      "Some say the placements are a \"lifeline\" for families whose children struggle in mainstream schools, but concerns have been raised about the lack of oversight within the growing industry.",
      "Online school placements can be commissioned by councils for children who are unable to cope in mainstream schools, usually due to special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).",
      "The schools offer live and recorded lessons for individual pupils and small groups. Most children who attend are at home, but some may join from a quiet room in their mainstream school.",
      "The government says councils should only use online schools which are accredited by a voluntary scheme set up by the Department for Educations in 2023.",
      "The scheme sees providers visited by education watchdog Ofsted, which examines areas like safeguarding and staff training.",
      "So far, eight online schools have joined the scheme but others said its criteria are too restrictive, particularly for part-time providers. The government has said there are no plans to change the eligibility criteria.",

      "The placements cost Somerset Council more than \u00a3400,000 - double the amount spent during the previous full financial year.",
      "The council said it had to use non-accredited providers \"from time to time\" due to an increase in demand for alternative school places.",

      "She said one of her children had been out of school for more than a year and was \"desperate to start learning again\" when online tuition was offered.",

      "Ms Mavir explained many young people have \"barriers to attendance\" which mean they cannot be in a school building, or can only attend part-time.",
      "\"For those families, online provision is absolutely key to keeping those kids connected to their education,\" Ms Mavir said.",
      "Ms Mavir believes it is important not to make \"snap decisions\" about how it is regulated.",

      "She said the number of children in alternative education rose by 20% in the two years from 2022.",
      "Dr Gillie described these schools as a \"lifeline\" for some, but said regulation is essential to make sure teachers are qualified.",
      "\"Each provider has its own pluses and minuses,\" Dr Gillie said. \"Certainly the ones that I've looked at have been well-run, well-organised, you can get a sense of who the people are behind the screen - and that's really important.\"",

      "\"This trend in Somerset is resulting in a dramatically higher number of pupils needing education of a kind other than is routinely available in mainstream schools,\" they added.",
      "The spokesperson explained Somerset Council is required by law to provide education to all pupils who have not been withdrawn from the state system.",
      "They said because \"all forms of provision are currently under pressure\" this may include unregistered or unaccredited providers \"from time to time\" to children losing out on education entirely.",

    "story": [
      "It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars.",
      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is name A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",
      "Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what \"AWGE\" actually stands for.",

      "His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance.",
      "The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty.",
      "5) Beef between the lawyers",
      "The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom\u2014it also saw intense clashes between legal teams.",
      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",

      "In written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".",
      "The band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.",
      "But they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.",
      "\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.",
      "\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"",
      "The court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.",
      "But they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.",
      "\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"",
      "The court hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday.",
      "The 1975 sued over Malaysia concert with Matty Healy kiss",
      "Festival axed as 1975 singer attacks Malaysian LGBT laws",
      "What happened on the night and in the aftermath?",
      "In footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".",
      "\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.",
      "\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"",
      "Healy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.",
      "Soon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"",
      "Healy's protest stunt sparked a backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".",
      "In a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.",
      "After their Malaysian festival appearance had been cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.",
      "Several months later, Healy defended the kiss in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Healy said it was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".",
      "He described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling."

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:29:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The Wicked actor has received mostly positive reviews from critics for portraying Shakespeare's Richard II.",
    "story": [
      "From playing Anthony in Bridgerton to Fiyero in Wicked, Jonathan Bailey has nailed the art of portraying regal characters.",
      "The trend continues as he now takes on the role of Shakespeare's Richard II at the Bridge Theatre in London.",
      "He tells the BBC that his portrayal of the authoritarian king who ruled in the 1300s was inspired by HBO's Succession, which explores the power struggle between the children of media mogul Logan Roy.",
      "\"I channelled many Roys,\" Bailey explains, adding that Richard II \"explores inherited power in a very similar way to Succession but also expands on it and takes it to a new level\".",
      "The first of Shakespeare's history plays, Richard II sees the unlikeable and corrupt king be usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke who goes on to become Henry IV.",
      "Directed by Nicholas Hytner, the modern-dress production sees Bailey as a cocaine-snorting and camp king.",
      "The 36-year-old said he chose to take on the role of Richard II as there was \"so much to explore with his character\".",
      "\"It's a feast of a play and really speaks to our times - it's fascinating to explore a king who has a cast iron right to rule.\"",
      "'Commands the stage'",
      "Bailey's performance has been positively received by most critics.",
      "The Guardian's three star review said his \"words glitter with feeling\" and added that he \"singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade\".",
      "The Evening Standard's review added that Bailey \"commands the stage and even allows a little camp to seep into the character\" while the Independent said, in a four-star review, that Bailey has \"an infectious spirit of camp naughtiness, he hugs his crown like a teddy bear, aims wry put-downs at dull courtiers, and bosses his court around like they're actors in a play\".",
      "However, in a three-star review, Dominic Cavendish from the Telegraph suggestedthat Bailey \"doesn't attain the greatness of Ben Whishaw and David Tennant\".",
      "There was also praise for some of the other actors, notably Michael Simkins. The Times said his Duke of York is \"stateliness personified\", but also awarded three stars overall.",
      "The New York Times also commended Simkins: \"His finger-wagging exasperation, verging at times on slapstick, gives an audience-friendly commentary on the unfolding intrigue.\"",
      "Newer fans of Bailey may not realise that he is first and foremost a theatre actor.",
      "In 2013, he played Cassio in Hytner's Othello at the National Theatre and has also performed alongside Ian McKellen in King Lear.",
      "Productions of Shakespeare's plays rarely have a large audience of young women, but Bailey's appeal among that demographic seems to have inspired them to visit the theatre.",
      "\"It makes me so happy to inspire a new generation of young people coming to the theatre,\" he says.",
      "\"If 10 people per show come and see Shakespeare for the first time then I'm doing something right.\""

    "story": [
      "Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny.",
      "Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death.",
      "Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying.",
      "As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to  meaningful change.",
      "South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that's four times the population of South Korea.",
      "But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry.",
      "South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising.",
      "This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive \"super fans\" who can make or break careers.",
      "That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds.",
      "\"It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,\" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law.",

      "Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims.",
      "\"This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,\" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize.",

      "\"Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,\" Prof Na added.",
      "Last year, the BBC reported on how \"super fans\" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script.",
      "It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (\u00a311,000) in April 2023.",
      "It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender.",
      "In South Korea, it is \"extremely tough\" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their \"idol\" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin.",
      "He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even \"add a rockstar-like edge\" to celebrities' reputations.",

      "Kevin Spacey has responded to fellow actor Guy Pearce's allegation that the Oscar-winner \"targeted\" him during the making of 1997 movie LA Confidential, telling the Australian to \"grow up\", adding: \"You are not a victim\".",
      "It comes after Pearce - one of the stars of the recent Bafta-winning film The Brutalist - this week expanded on his alleged experiences with the US actor having previously called him \"a handsy guy\" in 2018.",
      "Spacey - whose career was brought to a halt by a string of allegations - admitted to \"being too handsy\" and \"pushing the boundaries\", in an interview last year with Piers Morgan, while saying he'd not done anything illegal.",
      "In 2023 the actor was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault against four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London; and in 2022 a US court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against him.",
      "Spacey currently faces a civil trial over another allegation, which he denies, that he sexually assaulted a man in 2008.",
      "A further sexual abuse claim was lodged against him last week at the High Court, according to filings.",
      "'He targeted me, no question'",
      "Pearce told the Hollywood Reporter that the Oscar-winner \"targeted me, no question\" during the making of the 1997 crime thriller LA Confidential.",

      "He said the #MeToo movement, which saw allegations made against many men in Hollywood from 2017 onwards, had been \"a really incredible wake-up call\" for him.",
      "The actor said he \"broke down and sobbed\" and \"couldn't stop\" after he saw the allegations against Spacey in the news headlines. \"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Spacey responded directly to Pearce in a video posted on X, saying: \"If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me.",
      "\"We could have had that conversation, but instead, you've decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said.",

      "\"I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?\" he added.",
      "\"I apologise that I didn't get the message that you don't like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I've been through hell and back.\"",
      "Spacey concluded his message by saying he was happy to have a \"conversation\" with Pearce \"anytime, anyplace\".",
      "\"I've got nothing to hide,\" he said. \"But Guy - you need to grow up. You are not a victim.\"",
      "Pearce earlier told the US publication he had raised Spacey's alleged behaviour with him years later, and had \"had a couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\".",

      "The weapon has not been recovered by authorities.",
      "Jurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.",
      "Mr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.",

      "He was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.",

      "When quizzed on what he meant by \"this part\" by presenters Jon Kay and Sarah Campbell, Knight added: \"It's not over, let's just put it like that. I'm not allowed to announce it... but I'm just saying that the world of Peaky will continue.\"",
      "The writer and producer was appearing on the show to promote his new Disney+ period drama, A Thousand Blows, starring Stephen Graham.",
      "'Best British actors'",
      "There have been six series of the Bafta-winning hit BBC TV show Peaky Blinders, from 2013-2022, with the upcoming Netflix film continuing the story of Tommy Shelby and his Birmingham crime gang.",
      "It will see Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy reprise his lead role alongside an ensemble cast including Graham, Sophie Rundle, Ned Dennehy, Packy Lee and Ian Peck; as well as Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, Jay Lycurgo, and Barry Keoghan.",

      "\"The stuff that I'm watching, the rushes... no-one will be disappointed.",
      "\"It is quite an incredible thing.\"",
      "Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Knight also described himself as a \"BBC loyalist\", despite the fact his new period drama A Thousand Blows is launching on Disney+.",
      "In his latest creation, Graham stars as notorious boxer Sugar Goodson making his way in the dangerous world of illegal boxing in 1880s Victorian London.",
      "It follows the tale of two friends from Jamaica, Hezekiah Moscow (Small Axe star Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), who find themselves thrust into the capital's bare-knuckle boxing scene.",

      "\"People in the East End [of all genders and races], if you're cold, you're cold; if you're hungry, you're hungry,\" he noted.",
      "\"The real struggle, I suppose, in A Thousands Blows, is about east versus west\", he added.",
      "In a five-star review, the Telegraph's Benji Wilson said Knight's \"brutal new drama may be his best yet.\"",
      "\"The Disney+ 19th-century bare-knuckle boxing series is blockbusting television in every conceivable sense.\"",
      "The Standard's Adam Bloodworth awarded it four stars, writing that the show's ingredients made for a \"fantastically entertaining stew \u2013 as well as a chaotic and gruesome one, where limbs get hacked off in the ring and bones crunch like so many cornflakes.",
      "\"Tinge Krishnan and Nick Murphy's directorial vision is a dingy but Disney-fied labyrinth of intimidating backstreets and ropey pubs, while script writer and creator Steven Knight's script is confident but often sparse; a look speaks a thousand words, but when men like Goodson talk, you listen.\"",
      "Empire's Nicola Austin also gave it four stars, calling Graham's \"metamorphosis\" into Goodson \"incredible\".",
      "\"Though not always a total knockout, A Thousand Blows certainly packs a punch \u2013 courtesy of excellent lead performances, a gripping plot, and a fascinating historical setting,\" she wrote.",
      "And in another four star review, Morgan Cormack of the Radio Times said: \"Peaky Blinders comparisons will come, but this boxing drama is its own beast.\"",

    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",
      "\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.",
      "Kemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.",
      "As part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.",

      "Here are eight highlights from the winners' room:",
      "1. Mikey Madison took Robert De Niro's advice too seriously",
      "When Anora star Mikey Madison collected the best actress award, she started by admitting to the audience that she hadn't prepared a speech.",
      "Backstage, she jokingly blamed this on Robert De Niro, whom she recently appeared with on The Graham Norton Show.",
      "\"I just wish that I'd had a better speech,\" she said.",
      "\"I was on a talk show and Robert De Niro told me not to write a speech and I thought, I should probably listen to him. And I forgot to thank so many important people.\"",
      "Madison was overwhelmed but overjoyed with the recognition from Bafta.",
      "\"I think I'm a little disassociated right now,\" she says, \"I love making movies, and being an actress is my dream, and for my film to be recognised like this is incredibly special.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp the magnitude of being in a room like that, full of my idols, incredible creatives who I admire so much.\"",
      "2. Wallace and Gromit directors proud of 'Anton Deck'",
      "Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two prizes for its producer Richard Beek and directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. The trio brought their famous characters along with them to the ceremony.",
      "Crossingham reflected on the fact that stories about a cheese enthusiast and his loyal but long-suffering dog always seem to go down so well in the US, despite the films firmly rooted in UK culture.",
      "\"It is remarkable that our very Britishness is embraced in America,\" he told journalists.",
      "He highlighted one particular reference in Vengeance Most Fowl: the TV presenter in the film is called Anton Deck, a reference to Geordie duo Ant & Dec.",
      "\"There are some jokes, like Anton Deck, which are very British. In the American screenings, there was complete silence apart from one Brit guffawing in the corner.",
      "\"But we're very proud of that, we stick to our guns. Apart from one or two very specific gags like that, it seems to be embraced.",
      "\"And even if they're laughing at us, not with us, if they're laughing, we're still happy about that.\"",
      "3. Jesse Eisenberg is embracing the UK",
      "Jesse Eisenberg, who won best original screenplay for A Real Pain, walked into the winners' room carrying his Bafta and asking journalists: \"Am I expected to hold this heavy thing the whole time?\"",
      "After being reassured he was allowed to put it down as he answered questions, he reflected on the fact that the screenwriting prizes he's won for A Real Pain have both been in the UK.",
      "\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.",
      "\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"",
      "Eisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor. But, he said, it's not as close as people might imagine.",
      "\"In terms of our dynamic, I'll text him today and say, 'hey you won the Bafta, I'm so proud of you'. And then three weeks later my phone will buzz and it'll be [Culkin saying]: 'Hey, I just got this, thanks'.\"",
      "\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"",
      "4. Zoe Salda\u00f1a enjoyed 'jumping into the unknown'",
      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a continued her awards season sweep of the best supporting actress category with another win at Bafta, despite the recent controversies faced by her film Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Backstage, she reflected on her biggest number in the Spanish-language musical, El Mal, which is also up for best original song at the Oscars.",
      "\"Not getting in my own way was the challenge,\" she said of shooting it. \"Sometimes you can become very heady about something and you overthink it.",
      "\"What you have to do is trust the process... Rehearsing the dance was about reconnecting with a part of me I had missed so much but I had since let go of for more than 20 years.",
      "\"Reconnecting with that, dusting off all those cobwebs and jumping into the unknown was what needed to happen.\"",
      "Asked about the importance of performing the musical in Spanish, she replies: \"It's my first language, I was spoken to first, sung to first, in Spanish.",
      "\"We love we live, we fight, we work, in Spanish. And my art has [previously] only lived in a very English way. So that yearning to connect my culture with my art was meaningful to me.\"",
      "5. Warwick Davis thought he was being scammed",
      "Warwick Davis was the recipient of this year's Bafta Fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.",
      "\"It's very overwhelming, this whole thing,\" he said. \"You win the award and then you have to talk to loads of people, feeling very shiny.\"",
      "(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)",
      "Asked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!",
      "\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.",
      "\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?",
      "\"So I clicked on the email address, and it really was Bafta. Then I finished up at the loo, you probably didn't need that detail, and then went and celebrated with the kids.\"",
      "6. Adrien Brody reflects on career surge",
      "Adrien Brody's reaction to winning best actor might have been slightly hampered by how hungry he is.",
      "\"I haven't eaten anything yet, so I'm not sure how I'm feeling, but I'm so happy to be here,\" he says backstage.",
      "Brody is asked about the surge his career has enjoyed in recent months thanks to The Brutalist, more than two decades after his last awards run for The Pianist.",
      "\"The beauty of being an actor is that any life experience, and there have been many since [The Pianist], anything you've experienced is so valuable in shaping a sense of understanding,\" he reflects.",
      "\"So the moments of triumph, loss, complexity along your path, they give you an ability to represent those more truthfully and authentically in your work.",
      "\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.",
      "\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"",
      "And with that, he's off to have some supper.",
      "7. Edward Berger likens Conclave cast to an orchestra",
      "Conclave won best film and best British film, becoming the first movie to take the top two prizes since 1917 (the film, not the year).",
      "\"I am so humbled and so grateful to be welcomed here so openly with such warmth and open arms,\" its German director Edward Berger says of the UK. \"Basically, I just want to live here, I'm never going to leave.\"",
      "He likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.",
      "\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.",
      "\"They were all believable cardinals, all different nationalities and accents, it just felt they were all different instruments in a big musical piece.\"",
      "8. Brady Corbet is optimistic for the film industry",
      "The Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it.",
      "As much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"",
      "Corbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"",
      "Now that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"",
      "The Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.",
      "\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.",
      "\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

      "I have a confession: I've never watched a soap opera before.",
      "I'm not sure why, as I regularly binge shows with hundreds of episodes and love drama series. As a teen, I was addicted to programmes such as Waterloo Road and Skins, which, like soaps, followed the lives of a community who found themselves embroiled in increasingly outlandish plot lines.",
      "Despite ratings which are far below their 1980s peak, EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale consistently rank in the top 20 most viewed shows on UK broadcast channels every week.",
      "With EastEnders celebrating its 40th anniversary and ITV cutting back soaps in the schedule, I decided it was time to finally watch a soap opera. I watched a week of EastEnders, Emmerdale, and Coronation Street to see whether there's a place for them in the lives of Gen Z.",
      "My mum says that in the late 1980s, her university's student union was packed at lunchtimes as everyone gathered for their daily dose of Australian soap, Neighbours.",
      "Her experience was not too dissimilar from mine, except instead of watching soaps, my friends and I crammed onto the sofa eager to find out who had been behaving badly at Casa Amor or which Bushtucker trial awaited a group of intrepid celebrities.",
      "Sitting down to a watch a soap for the first time, I was unsure what to expect. I had never heard anyone my age talk about them before and navigating to ITVX and having to sit through three minutes of adverts was a very different experience from what I'm used to.",
      "I didn't want to do too much research into the shows but I did ask my parents, who are soap fans, to give me a bit of an explainer of who's who.",
      "After the opening titles and iconic theme songs that even I had heard of, I was surprised with how quickly the drama started. There was no scene-setting and I was thrust straight into the middle of some passive aggressive arguing in all three shows.",
      "Although the drama gets progressively more absurd, the sheer amount of scheming and fighting that is crammed into such a short episode means I was hooked for most of the show.",
      "But, I also had a lot of questions about how true the shows are to reality.",
      "How is everyone out and about all day? Don't they have to go to work?",
      "How is everyone out and about all day? Don't they have to go to work?",

      "I'm of the reality TV generation and I couldn't help thinking, why would I watch a scripted drama when there are shows with ordinary people dealing with dramatic situations?",
      "It feels hard to care about Cindy and Ian Beale's fractious relationship on EastEnders when I can watch a real couple break up because one of their heads has been turned by a bombshell contestant entering the Love Island villa.",
      "Only last week, a clip from a Spanish reality TV programme showing a man having a meltdown as he watches a clip of his girlfriend cheating on him went viral.",
      "You can't convince me that watching a man run along a beach howling after learning about his partner's infidelity doesn't make for more engaging TV than a couple shouting faux insults at each other in the laundrette.",
      "Competition with high-budget dramas",
      "Not only are soaps competing with reality TV, but they also face fierce competition from dramas produced by streaming services.",
      "\"It feels like this was filmed 20 years ago,\" my boyfriend says within the first five minutes of watching Coronation Street. Shots are dimly lit, characters stand around in dated kitchens and conversations last a few minutes before flitting to another storyline entirely.",
      "There's nothing wrong with this per se as it adds an element of gritty reality to the shows, but people are now used to high-budget, high-stake dramas with cinematic visuals and star-studded casts.",
      "In just 12 episodes across three soaps there were more plots than I could count - the storylines covered everything from depression to infidelity to knife crime.",
      "In the past, these storylines would have undoubtedly influenced national conversations but for me, it felt like the issues were dealt with heavy-handedly and often felt shoehorned into plotlines.",
      "In comparison to shows such as Sex Education, Euphoria, and Top Boy which resonate with younger audiences by addressing themes like mental health, identity, and social justice in a way that feels authentic and visually compelling, the teenage angst of characters like Betsy and Max in Coronation Street feel unrealistic.",
      "I realise it's unfair to compare the big-budget streamer hits with soaps. The first season of Euphoria which consisted of just eight episodes reportedly cost $165m (\u00a3130m) to produce which is far greater than the budget of soaps.",
      "But, even up against shows such as Made in Chelsea, which likely has a similar budget, soaps still perform poorly with young audiences. Around a quarter of Made in Chelsea's audience is aged 16 to 34.",
      "Perhaps I'm being slightly unfair to the soaps. After all, I am jumping in decades after they first aired with no prior knowledge, so naturally it's harder to build a connection with the characters.",
      "But the longevity of the shows is part of the problem.",
      "I recognised Ian Beale from the meme of him crying \"I've got nothing left\" and I understand the Dingles are one of the most important families in Emmerdale - but I know nothing about their backstories.",

      "Natalie Altman, 25, is an EastEnders fanatic. She started watching it a year ago after seeing clips of the show on TikTok and while it was confusing at first to follow the plots, she immersed herself with learning about their backstories on social media. She says the show feels more authentic than reality TV.",
      "\"I love it so much I've planned my week around the 40th anniversary and even cancelled plans to make sure I can watch it live.\"",
      "Despite none of her friends watching the show and thinking she's a \"loser for watching it\", she says she loves the escapism it provides. \"I'm quite an anxious person so being stressed about things that aren't real is really good for me.\"",
      "Data suggests the London-based drama has more than double the number of young viewers than Emmerdale.",
      "But, in contrast to Natalie, 25-year-old Ryan says EastEnders is a \"bit too doom-and-gloom\" and prefers the other two soaps.",
      "\"They feel more like real life where there are positive and negative storylines.\"",
      "He adds that he doesn't live in a big city so it's nice to watch shows such as Emmerdale that reflect rural life and aren't London-centric.",
      "By the end of the week, I found myself quite enjoying EastEnders more than the other two soaps - which could be partly because I grew up in London and therefore felt more of an inherent connection.",
      "But overall I struggled with the lack of cathartic ending for all of them.",
      "I don't mind a series having multiple episodes but I have to know that all the storylines will eventually be resolved.",
      "With soaps, there is no ending. Storylines carry on even when you think they're over. A character reappears years later or someone's brother's cousin's daughter from five years ago starts digging up the drama again.",
      "I'm unlikely to continue watching soaps after this week but I can see the appeal of them for the people who have been watching it for some time.",
      "There's something impressive about their longevity - will Love Island be celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2055 and will I be tuning in as a pensioner to watch a 21-year-old man tell someone their behaviour is muggy? Probably not.",

      "He followed that up with another heart-tugging video, for Remember My Name, in which Dave Johns (from I, Daniel Blake) plays an elderly man caring for his wife as her health fails. Beautifully shot and delicately told, these stories would bring a lump to anyone's throat.",
      "Death and loss loom large over Fender's new album, which is released Friday and is also called People Watching. He says it was inspired by his trips to and from a palliative care home to visit his friend and mentor, Annie Orwin, who he's described as being like \"a surrogate mother\" to him.",
      "\"She was the one that gave me the confidence to go on stage, and always used to be like 'why haven't you mentioned my name in your acceptance speech',\" he wrote on Instagram last year. \"But now an entire song (and album) connects to her. I hope that wherever she is now she's looking down saying 'about time kid'.\"",
      "If that leaves you expecting mawkish sentiment and introspective wallowing, you've not been paying attention. Fender is one of our finest songwriters, with a sharp eye for detail and a heartland rock style that turn even the bleakest observations into rousing stadium anthems.",
      "Standout tracks on his new album (which is produced by The War On Drugs' Adam Granduciel) include the chiming riffs of Nostalgia's Lie, which explores the false allure of living in the past; and Crumbling Empire, whose lyrics draw parallels between the de-industrialisation and urban decay of Detroit and Fender's hometown of North Shields.",

      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\""

      "The population of the town is about the same as the total number of overdose deaths recorded in Scotland in the past seven years - by far the worst rate in Europe.",
      "The deaths have led to calls for urgent action to tackle addiction in rural Scotland with relatives citing problems accessing vital services.",

      "\"At 10 to five in the morning, when it was snowing and my Christmas tree was up, the police came to my door,\" she says.",
      "The officers had come, as Jayne had long dreaded they would, to tell her that her 29-year-old son was dead of an overdose.",
      "James was another victim of a crisis that has been raging across Scotland for almost a decade, claiming 1,172 lives in 2023.",

      "He struggled at school with dyslexia and mental health challenges and later began to dabble with cannabis.",
      "He started to get into trouble, first with teachers, then with the police.",
      "As he grew into adulthood, James drifted away from Oban and from his family, losing a job as an apprentice bricklayer because of poor attendance and concentration, and disappearing to England.",
      "Jayne says she knew little about what was happening there. In truth, her son's life was unravelling.",
      "He had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and drug-induced psychosis.",
      "He was struggling with suicidal tendencies, taking more and harder drugs and increasingly turning to crime.",
      "As a result he was in and out of custody for drug offences, breach of the peace, break-ins and theft, at one point serving a two-year prison sentence.",
      "James died in Glasgow on 16 December 2022 - less than two days after he was released from custody following eight months on remand in Barlinnie prison.",
      "James' mother says she doesn't know the details of the last charges he had faced or why he was released - but she believes more could have been done to support her son, as he had overdosed on release from custody on three previous occasions.",
      "A Scottish Prison Service source pointed out that decisions taken at the end of a period of remand are a matter for the courts not the prison.",

      "A particular challenge, she says, was that Argyll and Bute Council offered James housing places in Dunoon and Helensburgh \u2013 both about two hours away \u2013 making it very difficult for his family to support him.",
      "The local authority said it had offered \"appropriate\" services to James.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",

      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",

      "At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who don't need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20% of all the beds the trust has.",

The doctors and nurses on duty, professional as ever, head straight for her bed, at least six or seven people. They need to get her to the resuscitation area fast, to save her life. But they can barely make their way out of the ward, because of all the patients in the corridor.",
      "A little later an ambulance drops off a man with mental health problems, who has cut himself in the lower abdomen with a knife. Despite the self-harm and his mental state, the ambulance staff tell the on-duty nurse that the outside mental health assessment service CASS, had refused to intervene, saying the patient wasn't in crisis.",

      "Resident doctor Charlie Hall, who's on duty, tells me he comes from a long line of doctors. \"It's not the health service I signed up for, at the age of 17,\" he says.",
      "\"The access to services, I feel, are creaking for patients and the ability to provide high-quality care is creaking. A lot of patients are very dissatisfied with what's going on, and I don't blame them. We're doing our level best in the hospital to give them the best treatment and the best options, but you can only apologise so much.\"",

      "This has been the case in the House of Commons' equivalent committee since 2015, using people from outside the institution with relevant knowledge to bring an \"independent and external perspective\" to decision-making.",

      "It had heard evidence that it might overwhelm police and the criminal justice system - which is already facing severe backlogs - and that any allegations of deliberate deception would have to reach the criminal standard.",

      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",

      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",

      "Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\".",

      "A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\"",
      "Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.",
      "The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.",
      "Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.",
      "Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.",
      "\"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\"",
      "The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.",

      "Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.",
      "They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\".",
      "The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.",
      "Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\".",

      "\"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,\" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are \"public servants acting independently\" and that, \"frankly, judges deserve better\"."

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:43:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The independent review says successive governments made \"knee jerk\" decisions to issue longer prison sentences.",
    "story": [
      "Successive governments trying to look \"tough on crime\" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.",
      "The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending.",
      "The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were \"knee-jerk\" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.",
      "Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026.",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "\"It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,\" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.",
      "England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.",
      "Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high.",
      "The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.",
      "It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.",
      "The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring.",
      "The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built.",
      "Mr Gauke said: \"Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse.",
      "\"For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system.\"",
      "He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, \"prison is not the only form of punishment\".",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Early release of hundreds of prisoners in Scotland begins",
      "Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population.",
      "In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes.",
      "As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place.",
      "Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people.",
      "\"Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,\" it reads.",
      "Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen \"something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most\".",
      "\"As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,\" he added.",
      "\"We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive.\""

      "The target was achieved between July and November last year, when there were almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared to the same period in 2023, the government said.",
      "That period was affected by doctor strikes, however, which would have suppressed the number of available appointments.",

      "Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.",
      "The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.",
      "The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.",
      "The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.",
      "BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.",

Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.",

      "The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.",
      "The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:13:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"The city also has a lot of social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"Poverty, drugs, many slums.\"",
      "With no access to water supply networks, people in the slums rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Fog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",
      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",
      "Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is \"very special\" for its sea fog, \"because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains\".",
      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",
      "\"Water from the clouds\", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, \"enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water\"."

    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed \"flushing\" the rock out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Mr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added that there had been a significant amount of historic mining in the area and it cannot be ruled out that there were some unmapped pits and quarries that have been built on.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",
      "Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.",
      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.",
      "Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",

      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",

      "Nearly 700 foreign seasonal agricultural labourers complained to the Worker Support Centre (WSC) charity in 2024 they were being treated unfairly by farmers who had brought them over to work, compared to just over 400 in 2023.",
      "One former fruit picker told the BBC more must be done to protect migrants from being treated like slaves.",
      "The UK government said it always took \"decisive action\" if abusive practices were found on farms.",

      "Ms Casimiro is currently taking the company to an employment tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and underpayment of wages, and now campaigns for better protection for seasonal farm workers.",
      "In an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.",
      "She told the BBC she feared the true scale of exploitation of workers was a \"hidden problem\", adding: \"Many seasonal workers continue to have their rights violated at this very moment.",
      "\"What is happening is very serious because we don't have access to any assistance or support.",
      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for Haygrove said Ms Casimiro's discontent was prompted by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July, as a result of extraordinary weather conditions.",
      "The company added that her allegations are \"materially incorrect and misleading\" and that it has \"never had accusations of this nature before in the history of our business\".",
      "It told the BBC that its practices \"are routinely audited by a range of third-party bodies, including by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), the Home Office, the British Retail Consortium, Red Tractor/Assured Produce, LEAF, Soil Association and SEDEX\".",
      "The company said Ms Casimiro worked at Hayford for 11 days before leaving with a free air ticket home, and her claims were based on a \"short-lived, snapshot, atypical experience\".",
      "\"We take great care in ensuring fairness and equality in our recruitment and working processes,\" the spokeswoman added.",
      "'Deeply concerned'",
      "The company said it is also co-operating with a nationwide GLAA investigation into how companies recruited 20 Indonesian workers.",

      "The Haygrove spokeswoman said: \"We are deeply concerned by claims that Indonesian workers were charged illegal fees by recruitment agents, which is strictly against our policy and principles.\"",
      "She added that the company took any allegations of misconduct \"very seriously\" and had \"co-operated fully with investigations by the GLAA\".",

      "However, the WSC, which works to prevent abuses of marginalised workers, said it dealt with a rise in complaints about the scheme during 2024.",
      "One man, from Kyrgyzstan, who worked on different farms in England and Scotland on and off over three years, told the WSC he had been expected to live in poor conditions, been discriminated against and been unfairly dismissed.",
      "The worker, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect future job opportunities, told the BBC through a translator that he felt standards had got worse over that time and farm employers did not care about workers' wellbeing, or level of pay.",
      "The WSC said its caseworkers dealt with 158 farm labourers in one month last summer and referred 19 cases involving 101 individuals to enforcement agencies. The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.",
      "The charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.",
      "A Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:23:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",
      "Melting glaciers leave homes teetering in valley of jagged mountains",
      "Satellite gathers best view of melting glaciers",

      "\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.",

      "At the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".",
      "A few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.",
      "Officials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.",
      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",

    "summary": "The tech giant is hoping AI at a lower price can reinvigorate sales of its flagship piece of hardware.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has announced a new iPhone which brings artificial intelligence (AI) features at a lower cost than its flagship handsets.",
      "The iPhone 16e has the same processor as the larger iPhone 16, Apple said, with similar storage options, though a lower spec elsewhere, including fewer cameras.",
      "Apple has been struggling to find a new product that excites consumers - sales of iPhones dropped at the end of last year.",
      "It will be hoping that bringing enhanced AI functionality to a less expensive phone will address that - however analysts have been cautious about the sales boost such tools bring.",
      "Its name is clearly a nod to its iPhone SE series, which were released from 2016 to  2022, and similarly priced significantly lower.",
      "Apple said the iPhone 16e will be available for pre-order from February 21 in 59 countries",
      "It will launch in the UK for \u00a3599, which is \u00a3200 less than the iPhone 16 - but more than double what the original iPhone SE went for when it launched in 2016.",
      "\"This now becomes one of the most affordable powerful iPhones now on the market,\" industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told BBC News.",
      "\"The move should help accelerate adoption and especially its foray into AI with Apple Intelligence.",
      "\"Apple's trust and credibility is critical - this alone will help drive sales and lure users from rival devices and platforms.\"",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Much of the conversation around the new handset will likely centre around its power, with Apple electing to use the same A18 chip behind its more expensive devices.",
      "This means the 16e will be capable of playing the same games and running the same apps as other iPhones - though AI is likely at the heart of this decision.",
      "Apple boss Tim Cook said in the announcement the new model featured \"the performance, intelligence and privacy\" Apple fans \"expect\" from the firm.",
      "And he said the Apple Intelligence features on the device would \"help you save time, quickly get more things done, and express yourself in new ways\".",
      "The firm introduced its spin on the tech - Apple Intelligence - with this series of devices, which includes new tools for writing and incorporating OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT into Siri.",
      "It hasn't always gone well, with the firm at one point suspending its AI-generated news alerts after they created false headlines attributed to news organisations including the BBC.",
      "It now presents the summaries in italics.",
      "Apple said its new phone is \"built for Apple Intelligence\", and pointed to certain features of the tech, like an easy way to clean up photos or search your image library.",
      "Other phone manufacturers have similar features on their devices - though the iPhone 16e will be by far the cheapest way to access AI on an Apple handset.",
      "\"The iPhone 16e generates a new revenue stream for Apple, and this will be particularly noticeable in key markets like India, where iPhones are out of reach for most people,\" said Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "\"There is also a second-order effect of cheaper devices like the iPhone 16e, bringing new customers into the Apple ecosystem.",
      "\"We've seen a limited appetite among many of the installed base to upgrade from previous versions, but the new phone reduces the cost hurdle of joining the Apple Intelligence bandwagon.\"",
      "Apple's current offerings are also underwhelming in light of the company's prolific investments in research and development. Cory Johnson, Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist, said Apple has spent $189bn on R&D over the last decade alone.",
      "\"All we have to show for that is the HomePod and $3,500 ski goggles,\" Johnson said. \"AI should be right in Apple's wheelhouse. But Apple fanboys, fangirls, and investors are right to be disappointed so far.\""

    "summary": "It says a new chip it has created could end up being as important a breakthrough as the semiconductor.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",
      "Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers.",
      "\"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\"",

      "\"The long term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields.",
      "There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve.",
      "But these are problems quantum machines might be able to rapidly crack, promising new discoveries by creating new medicines or designing better batteries.",
      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",
      "However, it claims to have a path to scaling it up to a million qubits - which would create immense computing power.",
      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",
      "\"This is promising progress after more than a decade of challenges, and the next few years will see whether this exciting roadmap pans out,\" he said."

    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",
      "The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.",
      "He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.",
      "\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,\" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California.",
      "According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for \"private gain.\"",
      "\"[O]ut of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,\" their reply brief states.",

    "summary": "Google is allowing advertisers to collect more personal information, which is harder for users to control.",
    "story": [
      "Privacy campaigners have called Google's new rules on tracking people online \"a blatant disregard for user privacy.\"",
      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",
      "It also says more privacy options provide safety to users.",
      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",
      "But opponents to the change say fingerprinting and IP address collection are a blow to privacy because it is harder for users to control what data is collected about them.",
      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",
      "\"My argument would be that fingerprinting sits in a little bit of a grey area,\" says Pete Wallace, from advertising technology company GumGum.",
      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",
      "He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK.",

      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",

      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous.",
      "Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months.",
      "A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody.",
      "The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse.",
      "Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK -  to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country.",
      "It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article.",
      "By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted.",
      "\"When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies,\" she says.",
      "A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021.",
      "That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen.",
      "By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. \"For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying,\" she says.",
      "Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects.",
      "Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs.  \"During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone,\" he says.",
      "Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. \"Each call was between five to 10 minutes,\" he explains.",

It \"will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen\", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation.",
      "According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN.",
      "\"Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us,\" warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families.",
      "Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home.",
      "Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began.",
      "Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything.",
      "\"If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing,\" Amal adds.",
      "About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world.",
      "Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice.",
      "\"I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless,\" Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. \"I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny,\" she says, her voice both anguished and bitter.",
      "A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available.",

      "However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as \"not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy\". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs.",

    "summary": "The pro-Russian businessman is reported to be moving overseas assets back to the Caucasus country.",
    "story": [
      "Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code.",
      "Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change \u2013 which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia \u2013 may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili.",
      "He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "\"Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,\" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze.",
      "With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies.",
      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",
      "There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacClearly, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili.",
      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",
      "\"All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories,\" says Beso Namchavadze.",
      "He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia.",

      "In January of this year, paintings and other artwork worth nearly $500m were imported into Georgia, according to data published by the Ministry of Finance.",
      "Many believe the artwork was from Mr Ivanishvili's valuable collection.",
      "\"For everybody who knows him it's pretty clear that this is something that he values the most out of all the assets, and all the wealth, that he has,\" says Tina Khidasheli, Georgia's ex-defence minister and the head of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea.",
      "\"He is going to bring paintings back and he does not want to pay tax on it.\"",
      "The head of Georgia's parliamentary committee on finance and budget, Paata Kvijinadze, recently defended the tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia.",
      "\"If anyone benefited from this law, I am happy about it,\" he said in a post on social media. \"This is exactly what the law was meant to be: to bring companies from offshore zones and attract more investments into the country\".",
      "In response to the proposed UK sanctions, Georgia's ruling party issued a statement defending Mr Ivanishvili, saying that a threat of sanctions was \"without any foundation\" against the party founder who brought \"democratic breakthrough to the country\".",
      "Separately, Mr Ivanishvili's lawyer announced last month that his client is suing Swiss bank Julius Baer for, among other reasons, misinterpreting \"the so-called\" American sanctions, which the lawyer described as \"political blackmail\".",
      "The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members.",
      "For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money.",
      "Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the \"global war party\", or \"deep state\", originate in his long-standing financial grievances.",
      "Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. \"Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues.\"",
      "Experts say that even though Mr Ivanishvili's current official position is the honorary chairman of the ruling party, there is a clear understanding that he remains the number one person in Georgian politics. Sanctions against him are therefore seen as sanctions against the entire government.",
      "Nika Gilauri was prime minister of Georgia from 2009 to 2012. He now leads a private company called Reformatics, which advises governments around the world on economic reform.",
      "Mr Gilauri says that Georgia's continuing political instability and international isolation is negatively impacting the economy. \"We are seeing a very negative effect on FDI, foreign direct investment, if you take nine months of 2024 compared to nine months of 2023, we have a 40% drop. So going forward this is going to continue to get worse.\"",
      "But the Georgian government paints a different picture.",

      "Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has even suggested that 10% growth was now \"absolutely realistic\" for the Georgian economy.",
      "But recently published research by Policy and Management Consulting Group (PMCG), a Georgian research firm, said that the prospect for the next six months was \"extremely negative\".",
      "It highlighted the impact of the continuing political turmoil, and said that the suspension of EU membership talks \"was negatively viewed by all surveyed economists\".",
      "Mr Gilauri of Reformatics says their own analysis shows that Georgia's economic growth this year will be zero.",
      "\"Going forward, we will have a budgetary problem, a currency exchange problem. We will have an inflation problem. We will have a jobs problem, a job creation problem, and we will have economic decline problem.",

    "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol's most fanatic followers believe the opposition wants to turn South Korea into a communist country.",
    "story": [
      "On a cold January afternoon, a young pharmacy student, Shin Jeong-min, waited restlessly outside South Korea's Constitutional Court, as the country's suspended president arrived to fight his impeachment.",
      "While Yoon Suk Yeol testified, she chanted along with hundreds of his incensed and worried supporters, who have rallied around him ever since his failed attempt to impose martial law. \"Release him now. Cancel his impeachment,\" they shouted.",
      "\"If the president is impeached and the opposition leader is elected, our country will become one with North Korea and Kim Jong Un,\" Jeong-min said, citing a theory popular among President Yoon's most fanatical followers: that the left-leaning opposition party wants to unify with the North and turn South Korea into a communist country.",
      "At 22 years old, Jeong-min stands out from the legion of elderly Koreans who have always feared and despised the North, and make up the bulk of those who hold these far-right conspiratorial beliefs.",
      "That generation of Koreans, now in its 60s and 70s, lived through the Cold War and remembers bitterly the devastating aftermath of North Korea's invasion in the 1950s.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law in early December, he played on these fears to justify his power grab.",
      "Without citing evidence, he claimed that \"North Korean communist forces\" had infiltrated the opposition party and were trying to overthrow the country. They needed to be \"eradicated\", he said, as he moved swiftly to ban political activity and put the army in charge.",
      "Two months on from his failed coup, an anti-communist frenzy is gripping Yoon's supporters, young and old.",
      "Even some who had never given North Korea or communism much thought are now convinced their dynamic democracy is on the brink of being turned into a leftist dictatorship \u2013 and that their leader had no choice but to remove people's democratic rights in order to protect them from both Pyongyang and Beijing.",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "'My country is in crisis': A divided South Korea grapples with Yoon's arrest",
      "\"This a war between communism and democracy,\" said one office worker in his 40s, who had slipped out of work to join the protest at the court.",
      "Another man, in his 30s, adamantly argued the president had to be returned to office as soon as possible. \"He's going to arrest all the North Korean spies,\" he said.",
      "Such threats were once very real. During the 1960s and 70s, spies would regularly attempt to infiltrate the government.",
      "In 1968, a group of North Korean commandos crawled across the border and tried to assassinate then President Park Chung-hee. A tree atop Seoul's Bugak mountain still bears the bullet marks from the intense gun battles that raged for nearly two weeks.",
      "In the 1980s, during the final years of South Korea's violent military dictatorship, a radical far-left student movement began to praise Pyongyang for its \"superior\" political system. They were labelled regime \"sympathisers\".",
      "It was also common for authoritarian leaders to accuse their political adversaries of being North Korean conspirators.",
      "\"Anti-communism became the dominant ideology of South Korea's military dictators, who used it to control society and justify restricting people's freedom,\" said Shin Jin-wook, a sociology professor at Chungang University.",
      "Today, these threats have dissipated. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and advanced cyber-hacking abilities pose the greater risk, and you would struggle to find anyone in South Korea who wants to emulate life in the North. The political left and right are merely divided over how to deal with their troublesome neighbour.",
      "While the approach of Yoon's conservative People Power Party has been to try to threaten the North into submission with military superiority, the left-leaning Democratic Party prefers to engage with Pyongyang, believing the two countries can peacefully co-exist.",
      "The president has been accused of exploiting people's historic fears. \"Yoon's rhetoric almost completely matches that of past dictators, and he is the first president to use this anti-communist ideology so blatantly since Korea became a democracy in 1987,\" said Mr Shin.",
      "Not only has Yoon accused the parliament, led by the opposition Democratic Party, of being riddled with Pyongyang sympathisers, but he has dangled the idea that North Korea, with help from China, rigged last year's parliamentary election.",
      "\"This is fake news cooked up by Yoon to demonise the opposition and justify his completely undemocratic move,\" one Democratic Party lawmaker, Wi Sung-lac, told the BBC.",
      "\"We have a long history of fighting for democracy and freedom in Korea. We are the ones who managed to thwart Yoon's attempt to destroy Korea's democracy,\" he said, referring to the opposition politicians who pushed past troops and climbed over the parliament's walls during martial law to vote down the motion.",
      "Such ideas were previously pedalled by extreme conservative groups, said Lee Sangsin, a polling expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification.",
      "\"These groups were isolated. People didn't take much notice,\" he explained. \"But because Yoon is the president, his words carry weight, and many people have accepted what he said.\"",
      "This was evident at one of the pro-Yoon weekend rallies we attended last month. Far from being die-hard conspiracy theorists, nearly everyone we spoke to said Yoon had changed their thinking.",
      "\"At first I didn't support Yoon, but martial law opened my eyes,\" said Oh Jung-hyuk, a 57-year-old musician, there with his wife. \"We can see how deeply embedded leftist forces are in our society.\" One woman in her 40s told us she previously had doubts about Chinese vote rigging but had researched the issue after martial law and \"realised it was true\".",
      "Yoon's supporters often point to real events \u2013 how the previous Democratic Party President, Moon Jae-in, met Kim Jong Un to try to orchestrate a peace deal; that the current Democratic leader, Lee Jae-myung, is being investigated for helping to send millions of dollars to North Korea - then use these as evidence of a greater plot.",
      "\"This far-fetched conspiracy theory that China rigged the election is becoming more and more accepted,\" said the sociology professor Mr Shin. \"One of the most basic consensuses in a democracy is the premise of fair and free elections, and now we have people distrusting that. This is very extreme.\"",
      "As Yoon's unsubstantiated claims have taken root, his support seems to have grown. Although the majority of people in South Korea still want him permanently removed from office, the number has fallen. Last week it stood at 57%, compared to 75% in the week after the martial law declaration.",
      "Through his anti-communist rhetoric, Yoon has also effectively tapped into a simmering distrust of China. To fear North Korea now means to be wary of China too.",
      "At a recent weekend rally in Seoul, many supporters had swapped their trademark \"Stop the Steal\" election fraud placards for ones that read \"Chinese Communist Party OUT\".",
      "\"I believe China is interfering in all South Korea's political affairs. It's pulling the strings behind the scenes,\" said 66-year-old Jo Yeon-deok, who was holding one of the signs.",
      "According to the polling expert, Mr Lee, \"a growing portion of the public now believes China wants to turn South Korea into some kind of vassal state\".",
      "For those in their 20s and 30s who have never experienced real danger from North Korea, China is a more believable threat. Last year the Pew Research Centre found that South Korea and Hungary were the only two countries where the young had a more negative view of China than the old.",
      "But contrary to the information they are being fed, young people's fears have nothing to do with communism, said Cho Jin-man, a political scientist at Duksung Women's University.",
      "Until recently South Koreans felt their country was superior to China, Mr Cho explained - but as Beijing has become stronger and more assertive they have started to see it as a threat, especially since the US started treating it as such.",
      "On top of that, young people have a lot of grievances: they're struggling to find work or afford a home, and feel resentful when they see their universities catering to Chinese students.",
      "Communism, Mr Cho believes, is being used as a convenient catch-all bogeyman to stir up fear and hate. This message is amplified by far-right YouTube channels, particularly popular with young men.",
      "\"North Korea and China are my biggest concerns,\" said Kim Gyung-joo, a 30-year-old IT developer, who came alone to one of the rallies. He used to be left-wing like his friends, he said, and was initially very critical of the president's martial law order. But after researching the issue on YouTube he realised martial law was \"unavoidable\".",
      "\"If I'd been in the president's position, I'd have declared it too,\" he said.",
      "Nonetheless, Wi Sung-lac the opposition politician is not concerned about his party losing support. \"Even though these extreme views are spreading, they will be limited,\" he said. \"Most people understand who we really are, and they are yearning for a return to normality.\"",
      "Polling expert Lee Sang-sin is less sanguine, likening Yoon's supporters to \"a fast-growing cult\". The president's move was \"very divisive\", he said.",

      "It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars.",
      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",

    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"The city also has a lot of social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"Poverty, drugs, many slums.\"",
      "With no access to water supply networks, people in the slums rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",
      "Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is \"very special\" for its sea fog, \"because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains\".",
      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",

      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is name A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",

      "\"Dirty.\" \"Perverted mind.\" \"Disgusting.\"",
      "These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week.",
      "The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: \"Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\"",
      "The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked  massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show.",
      "In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages.",
      "Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a \"National Creators Awards\" trophy.",
      "Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media.",
      "But the incident continues to make news.",
      "\"It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia,\" says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show.",
      "\"Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state  persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments',\" he wrote in a post on X.",
      "Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content.",
      "Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it.",
      "Raina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either.",
      "The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests.",
      "A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her \"body count\" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had).",
      "But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too.",
      "Fans of the show have hailed it for championing \"raw talent and unfiltered jokes\". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show.",
      "Experts have underscored how, with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqu\u00e9 and lewd - just to gain views and virality.",
      "It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired.",
      "\"A lot of comedy, especially of a certain masculine kind, is cruel and punches down on people. It has a violent undercurrent. So if you contribute to that culture, it's not a shock if it comes back to bite you some day,\" filmmaker Paromita Vohra says.",
      "She adds that successful comedy calls for a fine-tuned awareness of the audience it is being performed for and what boundaries it can push.",
      "Interestingly, Allahbadia's question, which sparked the furore, was almost identical to the question asked by the host of an Australian comedy show called OG Crew's Truth or Drink. While the question didn't spark outrage in Australia, it has in India.",
      "\"The internet has made it possible for content to reach spaces and people it was not organically playing to. Unthinkingly appropriating content can have unexpected consequences,\" she says.",
      "But she also says that there's a need to guard against making such issues a question of morality.",
      "\"When such controversies erupt, there is always the risk of morality being weaponised to punish people who have gone against what's accepted by society,\" she says and adds that morality is increasingly being beaten into the legal framework of the country, which can have a divisive effect.",
      "Some critics have also accused the authorities of using the controversy as a smoke screen to divert attention from other pressing problems - like unemployment and pollution. Some fear that it will be used by the federal government as a reason to justify further regulating content creation.",
      "After the controversy, a report by NDTV news channel stated that a parliamentary panel was considering making laws around digital content stricter. The Supreme Court too has pushed for more regulations around online content.",
      "Mr Gupta says the state already has a \"tremendous amount of power\" to prosecute people accused of flouting various data and content laws and that while the state exercises its powers without restraint, content creators don't have as many legal safeguards to protect them.",
      "\"Instead of tighter laws, we need more reform; existing legal standards need to be more tolerant of free expression,\" he says.",
      "\"Other systems, like education and digital learning should be strengthened so that young people know to get their education from the classroom, and turn to the internet only for entertainment.\""

      "She added, however, that people inside the hotel said that was not true.",
      "Using a hidden mobile phone, since contact with those outside of the Dec\u00e1polis Hotel is reportedly not allowed, the Iranian woman said the migrant told her there were several children in the hotel, that they have been denied a lawyer and that they are not allowed to leave their rooms even to eat.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:16:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Peers and scholars reflect on the role Muhsin Hendricks played in the LGBTQ+ and Islamic communities.",
    "story": [
      "The execution-style killing of an openly gay imam, Muhsin Hendricks, in South Africa has left people in the LGBTQ+ community fearful for their safety - but also determined to forge ahead with the campaign to end their marginalisation in religious circles.",
      "Reverend Toni Kruger-Ayebazibwe, an openly gay Christian cleric, told the BBC that Hendricks was a \"gentle spirit\" who brought light into any room he occupied.",
      "\"The gap Muhsin leaves is massive,\" she said, adding that she knew for a fact that there were \"a large number of queer Muslims around the world who are grief stricken\".",
      "The 57-year-old was shot dead in what appeared to be a hit on Saturday in the small coastal city of Gqeberha.",
      "Initial reports that Cape Town-based Hendricks had been in Gqeberha to perform the wedding ceremony of a gay couple have been dismissed as untrue by his Al-Gurbaah Foundation.",
      "\"He was visiting Gqeberha to officiate the marriages of two interfaith heterosexual couples when he was tragically shot and killed,\" it said in a statement.",
      "It is unclear why the couples had asked Hendricks to oversee their ceremonies, but it suggests that he was pushing the boundaries, even in the last seconds of his life.",
      "Traditional imams in South Africa rarely, if ever, perform the marriage of a Muslim to a non-Muslim - something that Hendricks clearly had no issue with.",
      "He had, according to a faith leader that the BBC spoke to, conducted one such marriage ceremony and was on his way to conduct the next one when he was gunned down in his vehicle.",
      "Two leading bodies that represent imams - the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) and the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) - condemned Hendricks' killing.",
      "\"As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,\" the MJC said, while the UUCSA said it condemned \"all forms of extra-judicial killings\".",
      "However, Hendricks - who did his Islamic studies in Pakistan - was a pariah in their circles, as they hold the view that Islam prohibits same-sex relations.",
      "They pointedly referred to him as \"Mr Hendricks\", rather than by religious titles like imam or sheikh.",
      "In contrast, Hendricks' supporters hailed him as the world's first openly gay imam who made it possible for them to reconcile their sexuality with their Islamic faith.",
      "That he was a trail-blazer is not surprising - South Africa's constitution, adopted in 1996 after the end of white-minority rule, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation.",
      "Then in 2006, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.",
      "Once in a heterosexual marriage with children, Hendricks came out as gay in 1996 - and, according to The Conversation, he later broke another taboo by marrying a Hindu man.",
      "He then spearheaded the formation of The Inner Circle as \"an underground social and support group\" for queer Muslims.",
      "It started out at his home in Cape Town, and has \"proven to be very successful in helping Muslims who are queer to reconcile Islam with their sexuality\", The Inner Circle's website says.",
      "Despite South Africa having a thriving LGBTQ+ scene, members of the community still face some stigmatisation and violence.",
      "Only a few of the country's religious groups have adopted policies that are more favourable towards the community, among them the Dutch Reformed Church and the Methodist Church of Southern Africa.",
      "The Dutch Reformed Church was in 2019 forced by the courts to reinstate a policy it had introduced four years earlier, but then scrapped, allowing same-sex marriages and for gay and lesbian pastors to be in romantic relationships.",
      "The following year, the Methodist Church said that while it was \"not yet ready to apply for its ministers to officiate at same-sex marriages\", no congregant residing in a member country that recognised civil unions would be \"prevented from entering into such a union which can be as same-sex or opposite sex couples\".",
      "Reverend Ecclesia de Lange, the director at Inclusive and Affirming Ministries (IAM), told the BBC that even in instances where faith groups had adopted inclusive policies there were still \"pockets of very strong conservatism\".",
      "\"The traditional interpretations of sacred texts continue to exclude LGBTQ+ people, so the struggle for acceptance within faith communities remains ongoing,\" she said.",
      "Senior lecturer in Islamic Studies at South Africa's University of the Western Cape, Dr Fatima Essop, reflected on the \"distressing\" vitriolic content circulating on social media in the wake of Hendricks' killing.",
      "\"I just find that completely shocking and so far removed from our... Islamic tradition, which is all about compassion and mercy and preservation of human life,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Dr Essop added that while she understood some of the strong feelings against Hendricks' work, there was \"absolutely no justification, Islamic or otherwise, for this kind of violence\".",
      "And while the motive is unclear, Hendricks' killing - and the negative comments that followed - was likely to make people fearful to \"speak about their sexuality or sexual orientation\", Dr Essop said.",
      "Reverend Kruger-Ayebazibwe said that while Hendricks' shooting would make LGBTQ+ leaders rethink their security, it would not deter them from campaigning for change \"because the work matters too much\".",
      "Hendricks has already been buried at a private ceremony, though his Al-Gurbaah Foundation has pledged to organise a memorial in the near future to \"honour his immense contributions\".",
      "For Teboho Klaas, the religion programme officer at The Other Foundation, which champions LGBTQ+ rights in southern Africa, his killers may have cut his life short \"but not his legacy because he has multiplied himself\".",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:13:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Two years after ChatGPT, China launched DeepSeek, but India doesn't have its own foundational model yet.",
    "story": [
      "Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications.",
      "But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots.",
      "The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months.",
      "A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently.",
      "After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users.",
      "Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table \u2013 committing $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's \"unmatched\" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential.",
      "With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too.",
      "But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say.",
      "China and the US already have a \"four to five year head-start\", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC.",
      "Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index \u2013 which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research \u2013 India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas.",
      "China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent.",
      "India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023.",
      "India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030.",
      "While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of \"patient\" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations.",
      "\"Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it.\"",
      "Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity.",
      "But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent \u2013 with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country.",
      "The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country.",
      "This is partly because \"foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs\", Mr Bindra says.",
      "And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors.",
      "The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push.",
      "The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "AI chatbots unable to accurately summarise news, BBC finds",
      "Indian media pile into lawsuit against OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT",
      "Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies.",
      "\"It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill,\" says Mr Roy.",
      "He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence.",
      "\"I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years,\" he adds. It is a view many others share.",
      "India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek \"to leapfrog our own AI progress\", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X.",
      "In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts.",
      "India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet.",
      "Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully."

    "summary": "Blake Lively alleged she was not the only woman concerned about Justin Baldoni's \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior.\"",
    "story": [
      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Lively's attorneys said they would work to dismiss both defamation suits against her. The first trial with Baldoni is set for March 2026.",

    "story": [
      "A jury found rapper A$AP Rocky not guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm Tuesday following a nearly month-long trial in Los Angeles.",
      "Screams were heard inside the courtroom upon the reading of the verdict as Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug his longtime partner, Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if convicted of all charges.",
      "At the start of the trial last month, he rejected a plea deal which carried a sentence of 180 days in jail.",
      "\"We said from day one, he was innocent. He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,\" Joe Tacopina, his defense attorney, told reporters outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown LA, where photographers swarmed Rocky and Rihanna following the verdict. \"We're honored to have represented this amazing family.\"",
      "Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged Rocky shot twice in the direction of his former friend, Terell Ephron, near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. Ephron, another former member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob who previously went by A$AP Relli, has said he was left with bullet-graze wounds above his knuckles. He testified that Rocky had allegedly threatened to kill him the same night.",
      "The defense accused Ephron of fabricating evidence, committing perjury and attempting to extort Rocky, saying the rapper had a prop gun that only fired blanks which he carried around for security.",
      "Rocky pleaded not guilty to both counts and maintained his innocence through statements by his attorneys.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman released a statement on behalf of the prosecution after Tuesday's verdict.",
      "\"While today's verdict is not the outcome we sought, we respect the jury's decision and the integrity of our justice system,\" Hochman said in the statement. \"Our office remains committed to seeking accountability for those who break the law, no matter their status or influence. Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.\"",
      "As closing arguments got underway late last week, Rihanna appeared inside the downtown LA courtroom with the couple's 2-year-old and 1-year-old sons with her for the first time, the\u00a0Associated Press reported.",
      "A$AP Rocky stands trial in Los Angeles",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas.

      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "From hunting of dangerous predators to surviving treacherous seas, Spencer Dutton's journey in \"1923\" has been anything but ordinary. Now, actor Brandon Sklenar is promising even darker waters ahead for the troubled Dutton heir in the hit series' second season premiering this Sunday on Paramount +, which is part of the same corporate family as CBS News.",
      "Sklenar  told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that creator Taylor Sheridan foreshadowed the depth of Spencer's story in Season 1. Sheridan was also the director of the series \"Yellowstone.\" \"1923\" is the \"Yellowstone\" prequel.",
      "\"You're kind of giving glimpses into what Spencer's capable of, and what demons he's sort of running from, and what he's fighting for. And I think he [Sheridan] really lets the cat out of the bag in Season 2,\" said Sklenar.",
      "The actor also praised the emotional impact of the season finale, describing it as \"profoundly beautiful.\" The second season promises more hurdles for Dutton and his love interest, Alex, as they continue their struggle to be reunited.",
      "Sklenar also discussed his experience working with Hollywood legends Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, who play his parents in the show. Though Sklenar couldn't confirm whether they share the screen in the new season, he spoke highly of the two, describing them as \"living icons.\"",
      "\"They're just so sweet, so kind, and they're human beings before all else, and it's a testament to why they have lasted as long as they have,\" Sklenar said.",
      "The actor also opened up about his own background, sharing how his blue-collar upbringing and background in martial arts helped him connect with Dutton. \"Spencer has like a physicality to him, that he uses his body and he's not afraid to take it to extreme places, and I can relate to that for sure,\" he said.",

      "Sklenar, who is also known for his role in \"It Ends With Us,\" said despite a legal battle between actress Blake Lively and director and actor Justin Baldoni, he remains focused on the movie's intended message.",
      "\"I just want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place, and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that,\" Sklenar said. \"That movie meant so much to me, and I have someone very, very close to me in my life who's gone through what Lily's going through for a long time, and I've been on the front lines helping her navigate that space, so that movie meant a lot to me, and it means a lot to her, this person in my life.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that things get taken away from what the ethos of that thing is and it gets convoluted,\" he said.",
      "As far as whether he is Team Blake or Team Justin, Skelnar said he is Team \"It Ends With Us.\"",

      "The show had its typical ending, with all involved looking exhilarated and exhausted on the studio stage. This night it was so crowded with luminaries it looked like it might break. Led by Short, they all applauded in tribute to Michaels, who created the show and has run it for 45 of its 50 years.",

    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "title": "Looking back at 50 years of \"Saturday Night Live\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgaine\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on January 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",

    "story": [
      "Online searches for gambling addiction-related terms have surged in recent years across the U.S., especially in states that have legalized online sports betting, according to a study published on Monday in the American Medical Association's peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Since the Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association Supreme Court decision allowed states to legalize sports betting in 2018, there were 23% more searches nationwide (approximately 6.5 to 7.3 million queries) related to seeking help for gambling addiction, the study found. The researchers analyzed search queries mentioning gambling, addiction, addict, anonymous or hotline, such as gambling addiction hotline, from January 2016 through June 2024.",
      "The increases in Illinois (35%), Massachusetts (47%), Michigan (37%), New Jersey (34%), New York (37%), Ohio (67%), Pennsylvania (50%) and Virginia (30%) were all higher than expected after the opening of sportsbooks in those states, the study found. The researchers also found that online sportsbooks had a significantly greater impact than retail sportsbooks.",
      "\"The significantly higher search volumes observed in all eight states make it virtually impossible that our findings occurred by chance,\" the study's main author, Atharva Yeola, a student researcher in the UC San Diego Qualcomm Institute, said in the accompanying opinion article.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the introduction of retail sportsbooks led to 33% more searches than expected for gambling addiction-related terms during the five months before online sportsbooks launched, the study found. After online sportsbooks became available, searches spiked to 61% over expectations and persisted for year.",
      "\"This study doesn't actually measure problem gaming rates \u2014 instead, it measures Google searches and awareness of problem gaming,\" said Jeremy Kudon, the president of Sports Betting Alliance, a trade organization that represents major online sportsbooks like BetMGM.",
      "As of 2024, 38 states had legal, operational sportsbooks, the study noted, with the total amount bet increasing from $4.9 billion in 2017 to more than $121 billion in 2023. That year, 94% of wagers were placed online.",
      "\"The National Council of Problem Gambling puts the rate of problem gaming at 1-2%, and the group testified before Congress that problem gaming rates have stabilized since the pandemic. Similarly, comprehensive, state-sponsored studies of problem gaming in Connecticut and Indiana have shown problem gaming rates have not increased after the states passed online sports betting,\" Kudon said in a statement to CBS News.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\"The real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there's an easy fix to Social Security's financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\" Slavov said. \"This is simply not true.\"",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\" she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"",

More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April.

      "The IRS will be carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS.

The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",

The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House.

    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",

Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Trump's nominee to run the Labor Department, appeared before a Senate committee for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, where she has faced questions about her support for a pro-union bill when she was in Congress and other labor issues.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",

      "\"If confirmed, my job will be to implement President Trump's policy vision. And my guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principal \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",

      "\"I'm the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right-to-work but would preempt state law on right-to-work \u2014 I think it's not a good thing,\" Paul told NBC News last month. \"And it'd be sort of hard for me, since it's a big issue for me, to support her.\"",
      "Paul questioned Chavez-DeRemer about right-to-work policies during the hearing, asking whether she is still supportive of the PRO Act, which he said would have overturned right-to-work laws in half the country. When Chavez-DeRemer said she \"fully\" supports states that \"want to protect their right to work,\" Paul doubled down, asking if she no longer supports the aspects of the PRO Act that would have overturned state right-to-work laws. She said she did not.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer will need at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",

Democrats expressed appreciation for Chavez-DeRemer's record during the hearing, but none emerged as clear backers of her nomination.",
      "So far, Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed with minimal GOP defections. Three Republicans voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republicans have otherwise united behind Mr. Trump's picks, with the exception of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against three nominees as of last week.",

But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

The NSF had 1,450 employees prior to Tuesday's job cuts, the spokesperson said. The 168 workers who were fired represent about 12% of that number.",
      "Federal workers who are in a probationary period are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment.

    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items.

      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",

They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",

      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",

      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",

      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",

      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company also said that it would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",

The Defense Departmen expects to redirect those fund to other programs in the department that would be prioritized by President Trump.",
      "Robert Salesses, who is performing the duties of deputy secretary of defense, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the department intends to produce budgets \"that revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence.\"",

      "Iron Dome is envisioned as an extensive, multilayered air defense system for the U.S. that Trump has said should include the ability to shoot down incoming missiles from space.",
      "He said that the secretary has ordered a review of spending plans in the Biden administration's budget budget to offset the costs of Trump priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. Salesses confirmed in the statement that the department seeks cuts of 8% from the Biden defense budget that would add up to about $50 billion.

      "At the time, the accounts that were easier to cut were found in operations, maintenance and personnel. The services lost noncommissioned officers \u2014 highly trained mid-level enlisted personnel \u2014 and cut training such as flight hours. Military training accidents quickly climbed.",

      "The Trump administration said it is pulling the plug on New York City's controversial congestion pricing plan, just weeks after it started, but Gov. Kathy Hochul and the MTA are fighting to keep it in place.",
      "In a letter to Hochul on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was terminating its Nov. 2024 agreement with the state. This after President Trump\u00a0spoke with Hochul at least twice about ending the program, according to a highly placed source familiar with the matter.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called congestion pricing \"backwards and unfair,\" saying it is harmful to small businesses.",
      "\"New York State's congestion pricing plan is a slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners,\" Duffy wrote. \"Commuters using the highway system to enter New York City have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes. But now the toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative, and instead, takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. It's backwards and unfair. The program also hurts small businesses in New York that rely on customers from New Jersey and Connecticut. Finally, it impedes the flow of commerce into New York by increasing costs for trucks, which in turn could make goods more expensive for consumer. Every American should be able to access New York City regardless of their economic means. It shouldn't be reserved for an elite few.\"",
      "Not long after the move to end the tolling plan, Trump posted on social media \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!\"",
      "The president addressed congestion pricing late Wednesday on Air Force 1.",
      "\"Congestion pricing is not a good situation. They're treating the people of New York very badly,\" he said. \"Supposing you worked at a shoe shop or you worked in a restaurant as a waiter, and you have to come into Manhattan and they're taking, you know, many, many dollars out of your pocket. You can't afford to do it.\"",
      "Hochul, MTA, Riders Alliance push back",
      "Hochul was clearly not happy with what transpired on Wednesday and vowed in a statement to fight the Trump administration in court.",
      "\"Public transit is the lifeblood of New York City and critical to our economic future -- as a New Yorker, like President Trump, knows very well,\" Hochul said. \"Since this first-in-the-nation program took effect last month, congestion has dropped dramatically and commuters are getting to work faster than ever. Broadway shows are selling out and foot traffic to local businesses is spiking. School buses are getting kids to class on time, and yellow cab trips increased by 10%. Transit ridership is up, drivers are having a better experience, and support for this program is growing every day.\"",
      "Hochul then took aim at Mr. Trump's remarks on social media.",
      "\"We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king. The MTA has initiated legal proceedings in the Southern District of New York to preserve this critical program. We'll see you in court,\" Hochul said.",
      "The MTA said Wednesday it was filing papers in court to make sure the program stays in place. MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber called the move by the Trump administration to rescind approval \"mystifying,\" saying the program has been a success.",
      "\"Today, the MTA filed papers in federal court to ensure that the highly successful program -- which has already dramatically reduced congestion, bringing reduced traffic and faster travel times, while increasing speeds for buses and emergency vehicles -- will continue notwithstanding this baseless effort to snatch those benefits away from the millions of mass transit users, pedestrians and, especially, the drivers who come to the Manhattan Central Business District,\" Lieber said in a statement. \"It's mystifying that after four years and 4,000 pages of federally-supervised environmental review -- and barely three months after giving final approval to the Congestion Relief Program -- USDOT would seek to totally reverse course.\"",
      "The Riders Alliance said\u00a0it will fight to keep congestion pricing.",
      "\"Public transit riders won congestion relief and are now enjoying faster and more reliable bus service from throughout New York and New Jersey. We organized for a decade, held two governors accountable, and prevailed in court in three states after years of exhaustive environmental studies. We are committed to maintaining and expanding on our victory and will defend it with everything we have,\" Riders Alliance Director Betsy Plum said.",
      "\"It is raising money to create construction jobs, fixing the subway. It is backwards and unfair to go back into the past to a gridlocked New York,\" Riders Alliance Director of Policy and Communications Danny Pearlstein added. \"We've won in court in New York, New Jersey, in Pennsylvania already defending congestion pricing. We are no stranger to litigation. We'll be back, and we expect to have the governor of New York and the MTA right alongside us.\"",
      "Hochul takes aim at \"long live the king\" comment",
      "At a press conference Wednesday afternoon with MTA leadership, the governor doubled down on Mr. Trump's \"long live the king\" comment posted on social media.",
      "\"I'm here to say, New York hasn't labored under a king in over 250 years, and we are not, we sure as hell are not gonna start now. The streets of the city where battles were fought, we stood up to a king and we won then. In case you don't know New Yorkers, we're in a fight, we do not back down - not now, not ever,\" Hochul said.",
      "She went on to say she and the MTA were fighting for all New Yorkers from commuters and drivers to emergency personnel and residents with asthma.",
      "\"I don't care if you love congestion pricing or hate it, this is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington. We are a nation of states. This is what we fought for. This is what people like Alexander Hamilton and others fought for, to set up a system where you're not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,\" Hochul said.",
      "Hochul also said the license plate reader cameras will be staying on, and Lieber added the MTA's legal filing states they will not be turning off the tolls until there's a court order.",
      "\"New York ain't going back. We tried gridlock for 60 years, it didn't work. It cost our economy billions. But you know what's helping our economy, what's making New York a better place? Congestion pricing,\" Lieber said.",
      "While Hochul and Lieber both say they are confident they will be able to beat the Trump administration in court, Hochul said commuters should now think of the president whenever they are stuck in traffic.",
      "\"If in some world that they are successful, the next time you're stuck in traffic, the next time your train is delayed, the next time you're in a flooded station because infrastructure repairs were not made, I want you to think of this,\" Hochul said, holding up an image posted on the official White House social media pages depicting Mr. Trump wearing a crown with the caption \"LONG LIVE THE KING.\"",
      "Opponents thrilled with Trump administration's decision",
      "Some New York City and suburban leaders hailed the decision to pull the plug on the program.",
      "\"We've said this was a loser from Day 1,\" Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said. \"This is good news for the people who have basically been, I think, hijacked by many of those who said this was going to help them, when, in fact, it hurt them.\"",
      "Fossella acknowledged traffic had improved in parts of the area, but said that's no reason for Staten Island residents to have to pay a third toll.",
      "\"Staten Island residents who have to commute by car to work already pay two tolls. This would be a third to travel in and around the city. And yeah, sure, there may have been pockets where traffic was reduced, but it was amplified in other parts of the city, outside the Central Business District, which is what we all predicted from Day 1,\" Fossella said.",
      "\"There is no no-toll option to enter into our city center using these federal funded highways. And so they're within their right to reverse this decision. And I'm glad that the president did,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said. \"It is a bad policy that hurts our economy, hurts small businesses, hurts residents.\"",
      "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman lauded the Trump administration for doing away with what he calls a \"very oppressive tax on the hard-working families of the Metropolitan Area.\"",
      "\"It didn't make any sense and my commissioner to the MTA, David Mack, was the sole commissioner to vote against it, and he was right, and President Trump was right. This is an oppressive tax. It's a burden on the taxpayers. It's a burden on the students. It's a burden on the people who work in that area. And it was the right thing to do to terminate it,\" Blakeman added.",
      "Blakeman said Nassau County residents were \"mad as hell\" about the tolling plan.",
      "\"Spending $9 just for the privilege of driving on a public thoroughfare is not something that goes over well for people who have to work in downtown Manhattan, people who are students in downtown Manhattan, people who just want to take their kids there for the day. So they were very angry about this and I think they are going to be very happy this tax is terminated,\" Blakeman said.",
      "Hempstead, the nation's largest township, sued the MTA, charging congestion pricing exceeded its congressional authority as a pilot program. Supervisor Don Clavin said he was gratified legal challenges like his were cited in the decision to plug the plug.",
      "\"I've never seen the Tri-State Area so galvanized, so against something as congestion pricing,\" Clavin said. \"They overreached. They had to go back to Congress seeking authority.\"",
      "Among those also applauding was Charlton D'Souza, president of Passengers United, which represents Long Island Rail Road riders. The group was opposed to congestion pricing.",
      "\"I've been going to the MTA meetings for years. This agency is accountable to no one. It's a mess,\" D'Souza said. \"The MTA didn't provide any additional service, so the trains have been crowded on the Long Island Rail Road. The buses have been crowded.\"",
      "Congressman Mike Lawler, who has been mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2026, also released a statement thanking Mr. Trump and blasting Gov. Hochul.",
      "\"This is a huge win for New York families, commuters, and small businesses ruthlessly targeted by this unjust tax,\" Lawler said, in part. \"Make no mistake: this entire program is nothing more than a scam -- a money grab -- and is the symptom of a far deeper, systemic issue in our state -- government overreach and rampant mismanagement at the hands of Kathy Hochul and her cronies in Albany.",
      "\"Instead of imposing new, crippling taxes on struggling families, we should be auditing the MTA, the worst-run authority in America, to find savings, address its outrageous waste, and make sure that commuters are kept safe and served as well as they deserve,\" he added.",
      "New Jersey lawmakers take a victory lap",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy,\u00a0who earlier had said congestion pricing was the one area where he and Mr. Trump could find common ground, released the following statement:",
      "\"I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Duffy for their efforts to halt the current congestion pricing program in Manhattan's Central Business District. While I have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not unfairly burden hardworking New Jersey commuters, the current program lines the MTA's pockets at the expense of New Jerseyans.",
      "\"Although we have had a difference of opinion with our colleagues in New York on congestion pricing, we have always had a productive relationship with our neighbors across the Hudson. I look forward to continuing that spirit of partnership for the benefit of the entire Tri-State Area.\"",
      "Congressman Josh Gottheimer, a vocal opponent of the tolling plan and a candidate to succeed Murphy, cheered the end of the \"Congestion Tax.\"",
      "\"Today is a huge win for Jersey families, their wallets, and the environment. From Day 1, when we first started this fight, we knew that the Congestion Tax was just a giant cash grab for New York and the MTA -- all on the backs of hardworking Jersey families,\" Gotthaimer said in a statement. \"They never cared about how the tax would hurt Jersey families. They just needed the cash to pay for the MTA's woeful mismanagement. That was just confirmed today, and now, we can all breathe a sigh of relief. I'll never stop fighting to protect Jersey families. As I always say, don't mess with Jersey. Screw with us, and you'll find out why.\"",
      "\"I am very happy the federal government got involved because New York was just saying to New Jersey, 'Hey, listen, you are going to be the piggy bank for us.' Well, that's over,\" Republican gubernatorial candidate Jon Bramnick said.",
      "Congestion pricing just got started in January",
      "The controversial program was approved by the Biden administration last year and\u00a0finally got started just last month, on Jan. 5, after years of debate and delays.",
      "Hochul has defended the program, pointing to early MTA data showing the program has been working. In an analysis released near the end of January - the first month of the program - the MTA said 1 million fewer vehicles had entered the most congested parts of Manhattan, and that travel times on inbound bridges and tunnels had been reduced.",
      "Congestion pricing is expected to raise $15 billion for repairs to mass transit, and the MTA says there is no contingency plan if the Trump administration manages to turn off those license plate readers.",
      "Prior to his election, Mr. Trump said he would\u00a0\"terminate\" congestion pricing, and he has been under pressure from local members of Congress to do so. Malliotakis previously said Mr. Trump had \"tasked the Department of Transportation to come up with options\" for him to put a stop to the program.",
      "Long road to congestion pricing",
      "Congestion pricing's road to implementation in New York City has been long. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed it back in 2007. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo moved the plan into law in 2019, and it overcame a host of subsequent legal challenges.",
      "Just weeks before it was initially set to start in 2024, Hochul put the plan on pause, saying the $15 fee associated with it at the time was too high. She later \"un-paused\" the plan with a revised $9 fee for most drivers, and it launched in January.",

    "story": [
      "John Rosenow, a fifth-generation farmer in Waumandee, Wisconsin, owns more than 900 acres and over 600 dairy cows. He said about 90% of the work on the farm is done by immigrants.",
      "Those immigrants include Kevin, who was born in central Mexico and crossed the U.S. southern border illegally when he was 18. Now 21, Kevin, who did not provide his last name during an interview with CBS News, is among the 11 million undocumented migrants living in the U.S. More than 10,000 of them work on Wisconsin dairy farms, according to\u00a0a report\u00a0by the\u00a0University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "Kevin's duties include feeding cows and cleaning barns. He told CBS News he often works 12 hours a day, six days a week, sometimes starting as early as 3 a.m. But the pay is better than back home.",
      "He said his mother and siblings back home depend on his salary, along with money made by his dad, who works on the same farm.",
      "More than half of all workers in the U.S. dairy industry are immigrants, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0by Texas A&M University. Many are presumed to be undocumented since dairy farms generally can't access seasonal visa programs to hire legal migrant workers. Like Kevin, many leave behind loved ones for wages that are below what American workers get.",
      "\"If I hired Americans to do the work, I would have to pay probably about $100,000 a year per person, and they would only work maybe 40-50 hours a week at that rate,\" Rosenow said. \"Clearly, I couldn't be able to afford to pay Americans as much as they want.\"",
      "But as the new Trump administration begins to follow through on the president's promise to deport undocumented immigrants, Rosenow is fearful of the future.",
      "When asked what would happen if his workers were deported, Rosenow told CBS News, \"I'm out of business. And it wouldn't take long.\"",
      "But Kevin doesn't appear to share his boss' fear.",
      "\"Four years ago, when he was the president, he said 'I am going to deport everyone' but it never happened,\" Kevin said in Spanish. \"Sometimes we would watch the news and we would see that a family was deported, and we were scared to go out and buy groceries. But I have not felt fear since then.\"",

      "On Monday, a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis caught fire and flipped upside down while landing in Toronto. All 80 onboard survived.",

Duffy said a team from SpaceX has been asked to give advice on \"simple, easy steps\" the government can take to modernize the air traffic control system.",

      "\"All the critical safety positions like air traffic controllers and inspectors, all of those positions have been protected. No one's been fired. Actually we were hiring into those spaces,\" he said. \"So 352 cuts is 0.8% of the workforce.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator without elections,\" echoing rhetoric from the Kremlin about the war in Ukraine and escalating a public feud between the two leaders.",
      "In a post on Truth Social\u00a0on Wednesday, Mr. Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy, accusing him of duping the U.S. into providing billions in aid to Ukraine and misusing it.",
      "\"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump inflated the amount of assistance the U.S. has sent to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022. The U.S. has provided $66 billion in security assistance. In total, Congress has appropriated $175 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine in 2019 with 73% of the vote. The country has delayed elections that were scheduled for early 2024 because of the war with Russia. One recent public opinion poll in Ukraine showed 57% of Ukrainians said they trust Zelenskyy, compared to 37% who said they don't.",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's attack on Zelenskyy was a direct response to the Ukrainian president saying that Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a Russian-created \"disinformation space.\"",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's comment came a day after Mr. Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, falsely claiming Ukraine was run by \"neo-Nazis\" who posed a threat to Russia and its neighbors.",
      "U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia earlier this week about ending the war. Ukrainian officials were not included in the meeting.",
      "On Capitol Hill, several Republican senators disagreed with Mr. Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would \"never refer to President Zelenskyy as a dictator.\" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Zelenskyy is not to blame for Russia's invasion \"in any way.\"",
      "\"To equate anybody or to suggest that anyone in Ukraine has responsibility for this war forgets the fact that Putin lied,\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said. \"He has lied every step of the way, and I believe any resolution in Ukraine that makes him feel like he won or just pushed to a tie is a bad idea.\"",
      "Mike Pence, who served as Mr. Trump's vice president during his first term, also spoke out against the president's comments, sharing a Fox News article from Feb. 24, 2022, with the headline \"Russia Invades Ukraine in Largest European Attack Since WWII.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\"The real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there's an easy fix to Social Security's financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\" Slavov said. \"This is simply not true.\"",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\" she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"",

      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "The IRS will be carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",

We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House.

      "\"The president's involved in business deals in a foreign country and you've got to wonder, what's he putting first, his business or Americans'?\" Libowitz asked.",

The president nodded \"in particular the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a special place with special leaders\" and mentioned Saudi finance minister Mohammad Al-Jadaan.",
      "Mr. Trump pointed out that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, was seated next to his right-hand man, billionaire Elon Musk in the audience. He also gave a nod to his son-in-law and former Middle East point person, Jared Kushner, \"a very special guy.\"",

The president floated the idea of giving 20% of the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency back to Americans.",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said, although 20% of those savings would only put a small dent in the federal debt, which is currently over $36 trillion. It's unclear where the other 60% would go.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:57:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The move threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who applying for immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has enacted a pause on all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine allowed into the U.S. under certain Biden-era programs, citing fraud and security concerns, according to two U.S. officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The application freeze will remain in place indefinitely while government officials work to identify potential cases of fraud and enhance vetting procedures to mitigate concerns related to national security and public safety, according to the directive.",
      "The move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were in the process of applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
      "While the exact number of affected migrants is unclear, the hold on applications applies to several Biden administration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. That law empowers the U.S. government to welcome foreigners quickly on humanitarian or public benefit grounds.",
      "The Biden administration used parole at an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to sign up for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration moved swiftly to suspend those efforts, arguing that they abused the parole authority.",
      "The Trump administration had previously halted new entries under Biden-era parole policies. But in a memo dated Feb. 14, Andrew Davidson, a top U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, ordered an agency-wide \"administrative pause\" on all \"pending benefit requests\" filed by migrants already allowed into the U.S. under three Biden administration programs.",
      "They include a policy, called Uniting for Ukraine, set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians with American sponsors arrived in the U.S. under that process before President Trump took office. Another affected program, known as CHNV, allowed 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans sponsored by American citizens to enter the U.S.",
      "The third impacted program consists of processes that permitted some Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans with American relatives to come to the U.S. to wait for a family-based green card to become available.",
      "Because those allowed into the U.S. under these programs were only given temporary work permits and deportation protections that typically last for two years, many of them applied for other immigration benefits, lawyers and experts said.",
      "Those benefits include a program known as Temporary Protected Status for migrants from crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela; asylum, which allows those fleeing persecution to gain a permanent safe haven in the U.S.; and green cards, or permanent American residency. Because of a Cold War-era law, Cubans paroled into the U.S. are eligible to apply for green cards.",
      "But under the internal USCIS directive, officials will no longer be able to process any applications for these programs or any other benefit if the requests were filed by migrants who arrived in the U.S. under the targeted Biden administration policies.",
      "\"This effectively freezes their ability to move into another legal status,\" said Lynden Melmed, who served as the top lawyer at USCIS during the administration of former President George W. Bush and now works as a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP. \"In the interim, they would remain susceptible to removal from the country if the government terminates their parole status.\"",
      "The USCIS memo said the move is justified because \"[c]urrently, fraud information and public safety or national security concerns are not being properly flagged in USCIS' adjudicative systems.\" The directive cites the Biden administration's move last year to temporarily pause the parole initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans due to fraud concerns.",
      "In his memo, Davidson referenced investigations that he said found thousands of CHNV applications with \"serial sponsors,\" information of deceased individuals or identical addresses. He said some of those cases were proven to be fraud. Davidson also said some migrants allowed into the U.S. under CHNV \"were not fully vetted.\"",
      "The pause, Davidson said in his memo, could potentially be lifted, but only once officials complete a \"comprehensive review and evaluation of the in-country population of aliens who are or were paroled into the United States under these categorical parole programs.\"",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the \"administrative hold\" on applications would be in effect \"pending the completion of additional vetting to identity any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns.\"",
      "The Trump administration has targeted those who've come to the U.S. under the Biden-era immigration parole programs in other ways, too.",
      "Last month, officials authorized federal immigration agents to seek the deportation \u2014 including in an expedited fashion in some cases \u2014 of those permitted to enter the U.S. under the CHNV program and other Biden administration parole policies. The administration has also drafted plans to revoke the parole status of many of those who've come to the U.S. under CHNV.",

    "summary": "President Trump endorsed the House Republicans' budget proposal to begin enacting his agenda as the Senate pursues a competing plan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed House Republicans' budget proposal that would enact trillions of dollars in spending reductions and tax cuts in a single bill, saying on Wednesday that he prefers that approach over the Senate's competing two-bill plan.",
      "\"We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,'\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"It will, without question, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The president praised House and Senate Republicans, saying they're doing a \"SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable.\" But he said the Senate proposal would address just part of his agenda to begin, while the House's proposal would address it in its entirety. Both approaches would rely on a process known as budget reconciliation that allows legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans, led by Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, have been pursuing a two-bill plan, which leaves the extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts for a later date in order to quickly increase funding for border security and defense. But House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the Senate would move forward this week with its proposal on the Senate floor, after both the House and Senate advanced their resolutions out of committee last week. The Senate had deferred to the House for weeks to kickstart the process, but began pushing ahead earlier this month.",
      "Thune told reporters after Mr. Trump's announcement that the Senate is still \"planning to proceed\" with its resolution this week, but he noted that they hoped to hear more from Vice President JD Vance during a lunch meeting on Wednesday. Thune said he didn't speak with the president ahead of the endorsement, and that he \"did not see that one coming,\" referring to the president's post.",
      "After the lunch meeting, Thune said the Senate would begin voting on the budget resolution Thursday night, saying Mr. Trump \"likes optionality.\"",
      "\"If the House can produce one big beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line,\" Thune said, adding that the question before them is a \"tactical one\" and that the \"strategic objectives\" of approaches are the same.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso told reporters following the meeting that Senate Republicans \"want to move ahead with speed,\" adding that if the House, which is away on recess, had been in town this week, it would be a \"different discussion.\"",
      "\"We have a shared agenda focused on rebuilding the economy, getting the country back to work and securing the border and making sure that America is strong and safe,\" Barrasso said.",
      "The president's endorsement follows months of back and forth over the path forward. Though Mr. Trump initially indicated support for a single-bill approach, he had appeared to step back from weighing in on the process in recent weeks, making clear his support for approving his agenda \u2014 no matter the approach.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:05:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The initial accounting by DOGE of its estimated savings was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
    "story": [
      "After repeated delays, the Department of Government Efficiency on Monday released a \"wall of receipts\" \u2014 what it characterized as documentation of the money saved by the slashing cuts to jobs and contracts pushed by Elon Musk's team at DOGE over the past several weeks.",
      "The initial accounting was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
      "Among the errors were contracts that DOGE identified for cuts, saying the move could save billions for taxpayers. But they were actually standard government funding vehicles called \"indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity\" contracts. The DOGE team misread these specialized contracts, experts told CBS News, and as a result overstated their push for savings by as much as $1.96 billion.",
      "A closer inspection of another big so-called savings: the cancellation of a contract DOGE identified as worth $8 billion was in fact worth only $8 million. This single mistake slashed the receipts of savings DOGE said it had identified in half \u2014 to $8.4 billion.",
      "That error involved an award for Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Equal Opportunity Employment Office, and the contract described the project as \"Program and Technical Support Services for Office of Diversity and Civil Rights.\" In his first days in office, President Trump signed executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.",
      "The DOGE team led by Musk has become a hallmark of Mr. Trump's early days in office, as members of the efficiency team set up shop in federal agencies to identify cuts of employees, grants and contracts. The president has praised the effort, which he says is a long overdue move to eliminate waste.",
      "\"They're doing a hell of a job, it's an amazing job they're doing,\" he said during remarks in the Oval Office on Feb. 11. \"You know that force is building, I call it 'the force of super geniuses.'\"",
      "DOGE's accounting error involving indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, known in government-speak as IDIQ, occurred because the team likely misunderstood how government contracting works, experts told CBS News. These contracts are designed to set a ceiling for the funding of a larger project.",
      "Multiple contractors bid on tasks within that IDIQ. The ceiling for the project identified by DOGE was $655 million. But DOGE claimed savings of $654,990,000 three times. In actuality, the government spent less on the contract \u2014 around $400 million over the course of the past four years for 44 different sub-contracts\u00a0\u2014 and the IDIQ is likely to have only minimal additional spending.",
      "That specific contract was called USAID EVAL-ME II IDIQ and it provided \"monitoring, evaluation and learning services to promote evidence-based decision making for adaptive management across USAID.\" One of the contractors involved told CBS News that this program was directly responsible for ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money was spent in accordance with U.S. goals and interests.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the discrepancy, and DOGE also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE \"may be more interested in inflating savings than in accurately reporting them,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight.",
      "The New York Times, which first reported DOGE's $8 billion accounting error, pointed out that a 2022 version of this contract was listed at $8 billion, and on Jan. 22 of this year, the figure was changed to $8 million. The contracting company, D&G Solutions, confirmed to CBS News that this was originally the result of an accounting error and that $3.8 million of the contract had already been expended.",
      "On Wednesday morning, DOGE fixed the error, and the website now shows $8 million in savings for that contract, but the link they provide for the \"receipt\" is to the earlier $8 billion figure.",
      "Musk recently admitted he knows DOGE isn't perfect. Defending DOGE during an Oval Office appearance on Feb. 11, he said that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected.\"",
      "\"Nobody's going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes,\" he added.",
      "Beyond the ICE contract blunder, Amey described the numbers as underwhelming. Excluding the impact of USAID's elimination, receipts of contract savings from other agencies appear to total $2 billion \u2014 a fraction of the federal budget, which stands at $6.75 trillion.",
      "\"If DOGE's goal is to trim a trillion or two, it has a long way to go, and Congress has to do its job to cut spending, too,\" Amey said. Musk has said he'd like to trim $2 trillion, putting DOGE at 0.1% of his goal.",
      "Many of these contract cancellations, outside of the USAID cuts, appear to have been selected based on language in the agreements referencing diversity, equity, or inclusion, CBS News' review found.",
      "And at what cost? Among the receipts on the DOGE wall was funding for a\u00a0 Department of Education project that's now been scrapped. The contractor described the real-world consequences in an interview: \"Thirteen school districts across 11 states were set to receive more than $13 million to support over 1,070 youth with disabilities participating in the program.\"",
      "At USAID, savings touted by DOGE\u00a0 on X on Saturday included $10 million for \"Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcision\" and $9.7M for UC Berkeley to develop \"a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise driven skills\" amongst other cuts. Circumcision has been proved to reduce the spread of HIV by as much as 60%. Programs like that have the potential to significantly lower costs for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, which provides antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS and had been given a limited waiver to continue to operate at the end of January. It has been credited with helping to save 26 million lives. One 2017 estimate suggested that widespread circumcision efforts could avert 3.6 million new HIV infections and save $16.5 billion.",
      "DOGE has for weeks been promising an accounting of the unprecedented sweep through federal agencies that appears to have left hundreds of workers suddenly jobless.",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's abrupt firings have set government agencies on edge. The government is now trying to rehire hundreds of workers in the U.S. nuclear weapons program after last week's layoffs. Farmers across the U.S. remain in limbo after promised federal funds for healthy soil initiatives \u2014 amounting to thousands of dollars per farm \u2014 failed to materialize. Life-saving efforts across Africa have also been put on hold while service providers wait for clarity on whether court-ordered funds will resume.",

      "President Trump, speaking Tuesday afternoon from his home in Florida, appeared to shift three years \u2014 if not many decades \u2014 of U.S. foreign policy almost 180 degrees, issuing remarks that made his administration sound aligned more with Russian President Vladimir Putin than America's European allies of the last eight decades.",
      "In rhetoric similar to claims Putin has used himself to justify his three-year\u00a0war on Ukraine, Mr. Trump seemed to blame President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Russia's full-scale invasion after the Ukrainian leader took issue with being left out of initial conversations between the White House and Moscow, which began Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well. Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years \u2014 you should have never started it,\" Mr. Trump chided Zelenskyy. \"You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land. Everything, almost all of the land. And no people would have been killed and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.\"",
      "\"This is, frankly, what Vladimir Putin would have said \u2014 that none of this needed to happen, when in fact, it happened because he wanted it to happen,\" Ravi Agrawal, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, told CBS News' Major Garrett after hearing Mr. Trump's remarks.",
      "Zelenskyy reacted Wednesday, saying Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a \"disinformation space\" fostered by Russia.",
      "Putin, who first sent forces into Ukraine in 2014 and seized control of its Crimean Peninsula in a unilateral annexation never recognized by the U.S. or most of the world, has claimed he was forced to launch his full-scale attack on the neighboring nation due to a threat posed by the U.S.-led NATO alliance spreading its influence eastward toward Russia's border.",
      "The U.S. and its European NATO allies have always dismissed that excuse, insisting that Putin's real intention ahead of the February 2022 full-scale invasion was always to seize more of Ukraine's sovereign territory and delegitimize Zelenskyy's pro-Western government.",
      "\"NATO consists of 32 countries and NATO's position is that it [war in Ukraine] was unprovoked,\" U.S. Navy Adm. Stuart B. Munsch, commander of JFC Naples, one of NATO's three Joint Force Commands, said Wednesday in Romania when asked about Mr. Trump's remarks. Munsch \u2014 one of the U.S. Navy's longest-serving active duty officers \u2014 is in Romania this week for a NATO military exercise aimed at preparing the alliance for any further Russian aggression on Europe's far eastern flank.",
      "Mr. Trump has made fiery rhetoric, and sometimes a loose adherence to fact, a hallmark of his negotiating tactics with foreign powers \u2014 including a baseless claim from his Mar-a-Lago mansion on Tuesday that Zelenskyy's approval rating had dipped to 4%, when domestic polling in Ukraine shows it over 50%. That lines up with Kremlin propaganda, along with a call for Ukraine to hold new elections and a suggestion it should have done so already, despite the country's constitution making a vote impossible under the current state of emergency sparked by Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarkable espousal of Russian rhetoric has fueled rising concern in Europe that the U.S. could be shifting the enormous weight of its geopolitical and security influence away from the deep-rooted democracies of the West, toward the autocratic rulers of the ideologically conservative east, and especially Putin.",
      "The Russian leader's longtime confidant, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, acknowledged the shift Wednesday, lauding Mr. Trump and saying his \"remarks on NATO being the main reason for the conflict in Ukraine are a signal that he understands our position.\"",
      "\"I assume the United States, as discussed yesterday, intends to remove obstacles that are in the path of promising projects. We have begun to move away from the edge of the abyss where Biden's administration led our relationship,\" the veteran Russian diplomat said.",
      "Zelenskyy has softened his stance in recent months, seemingly accepting that he may have to cede some of his country's Russian-occupied territory in an eventual peace deal, but he's made it clear that Ukraine must be involved in the negotiations for a ceasefire agreement, and that his country will need security guarantees from the U.S. and the West to protect it from any future Russian attack.",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he wanted to end the war \"this year,\" but he admonished the Trump administration for helping Russia's autocratic regime to \"break out\" of the isolation it brought upon itself \u2014 in the form of sanctions and cut-off diplomacy \u2014 by launching the unprovoked attack on his country.",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of Zelenskyy later Wednesday, accusing him doing \"a terrible job\" and \u00a0of \"playing\" the Biden administration to convince the U.S. to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \"to go into a War that couldn't be won.\"",
      "Repeating the Kremlin's misleading refrain that Zelenskyy \"refuses to have Elections,\" Mr. Trump went as far as calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" warning the Ukrainian leader that he, \"better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",

      "It was unclear how hard Mr. Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv Wednesday to \"sit and listen\" to Zelenskyy's administration after the Ukrainians were left out of the initial dialogue with the Kremlin, would push the American president's viewpoint that Ukraine could or should have prevented or stopped the war foisted upon it by its far larger, far better armed, autocratically-ruled neighbor.",
      "Upon arriving, Kellogg, a retired three-star general, said it was nice to be visiting Kyiv \"just a few days before the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" seemingly acknowledging which side had initiated the war.",

      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Kellogg called his visit \"a chance to have some good, substantial talks,\" but what Ukraine will want is a clear indication that the world's biggest military power will somehow protect it from future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy has long said that could come in the form of either NATO membership for his country or NATO forces deployed to enforce a ceasefire.",
      "After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the White House delegation's bilateral talks with Lavrov in Saudia Arabia on Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister said point-blank that the Kremlin wouldn't accept either of those things. Russia has already ruled out any exchange of occupied territory with Ukraine, and it's unclear what concessions the Trump administration could try to win from Russia for a peace deal.",

      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Affected organizations said the move would prevent them from offering critical legal services to migrant children who crossed the U.S. southern border without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "Legal services groups that offer representation and guidance to thousands of migrant children facing deportation said on Tuesday that they were abruptly directed by the Trump administration to halt their government-funded work.",
      "Affected organizations across the U.S. said the move would prevent them from offering critical legal services, including \"know your rights\" sessions, to migrant children who crossed the U.S. southern border without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "Under U.S. law, the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for housing unaccompanied migrant minors who enter the U.S. without legal authorization, until they turn 18 or can be placed with a sponsor, who is typically a relative in the U.S. The government has long funded efforts by nonprofits to provide these children legal counsel \u2014 both in custody and after they are released from government care \u2014 while immigration judges decide whether they can remain in the U.S.",
      "The Acacia Center for Justice, an organization that oversees the main federal contract funding legal services for migrant children, received an order on Friday that directed the group to immediately\u00a0 \"stop all work\" under that contract, according to a copy of the notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Shaina Aber, the executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said her organization has nearly 100 subcontractors providing legal services to roughly 26,000 migrant children across the country who are or were at some point in the custody of HHS, which oversees a network of child shelters.",
      "Aber said the stop work order would immediately halt funding for know your rights presentations and legal screenings that lawyers conduct soon after migrant children arrive in the U.S. to determine whether they qualify for a benefit that would allow them to stay in the country legally. Those benefits could include asylum, for those fleeing persecution, and visas for abused, neglected or abandoned youth.",
      "But Aber said the contract pause would also force non-profits to use their own funds to continue representing migrant children in immigration court, noting that attorneys have ethical obligations to their clients and can't simply abandon their cases. She said it's unclear how long organizations could do this without federal support, since migrant youth typically don't have the financial means to pay for lawyers.",
      "\"I think the due process rights of children will reach a new low,\" Aber said in an interview.",
      "The stop work order to Aber's group was issued by the Department of Interior, who she said administers the federal contract for her organization, even though the funding comes from HHS. Both departments did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Various immigration non-profit groups that received funds under the federal contract that was suspended protested the government's decision, including the California-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, the Texas-based Estrella del Paso and the Illinois-based National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration is abandoning children for the sake of politics and leaving kids to fend for themselves against our complex immigration system,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, the president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.",
      "It's unclear what exactly prompted the stop work order, but the Trump administration has been moving aggressively to dramatically cut federal spending that it sees as wasteful and misaligned with its policy views, including on immigration. The administration, for example, has also issued stop work orders to the non-profit groups that resettle newcomers under the U.S. refugee program, which President Trump has suspended.",
      "The Trump administration has made other policy changes affecting unaccompanied migrant children.",
      "Last week, officials at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the HHS branch that cares for unaccompanied children, significantly tightened the vetting process for those seeking to sponsor minors out of its custody. Under the policy change, all adults in households applying to sponsor migrant children will need to submit fingerprints for background checks, not just the prospective sponsors themselves.",
      "The Trump administration has also been working on expanding collaboration between the refugee agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a prospect that has alarmed advocates who say it will discourage some family members from sponsoring migrant children, if they are in the U.S. illegally. The administration installed a former ICE official to run the refugee office.",
      "Trump administration officials have said drastic changes are necessary to protect migrant children from exploitation and trafficking. They have accused the Biden administration, which faced a historic influx in unaccompanied children crossing the southern border, of not sufficiently tracking and protecting these minors.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at National Center for Youth Law, a group that represents migrant children in a federal court case, said the move to halt funding for lawyers undermined the Trump administration's stated goals, calling it \"reckless.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, touches millions of Americans and has become deeply woven into the U.S. health care system.",
    "story": [
      "In January, during\u00a0a congressional hearing on his way to becoming secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got basic details wrong about Medicaid \u2014 a program he now oversees.",
      "He said that Medicaid is fully funded by the federal government (it's not) and that many enrollees are unsatisfied with high out-of-pocket costs (enrollees pay limited, if any, out-of-pocket costs).",
      "Medicaid\u00a0is complex. The\u00a0$880 billion-a-year\u00a0state-federal program offers health coverage to millions of disabled and low-income Americans. The program covers different services for different people in different parts of the country \u2014 and enrollees may interact with private insurance companies without \"Medicaid\" in their names, leaving some unaware that they're on the program at all.",
      "Although President Donald Trump\u00a0promised to \"love and cherish\" Medicaid, Republicans in Congress last week announced federal budget proposals that could dramatically curtail the program. As that debate begins, here is what you need to know about Medicaid.",
      "What is Medicaid, and how is it different from Medicare?",
      "Medicaid and Medicare were created by the same legislation \u2014 an addition to the Social Security Act \u2014 that was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.",
      "Medicaid is a government health insurance program for people with low incomes and adults and children with disabilities.",
      "Medicare, by contrast, generally covers those\u00a065 or older.",
      "For older Americans with low incomes, Medicaid covers out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. Such people are commonly called \"dual eligibles,\" because they qualify for both programs.",
      "Who is on Medicaid?",
      "More than 79 million people receive services from Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program. That represents about 20% of the total population of the United States. Most enrollees qualify because of low incomes.",
      "About 40% of all children in the country are covered by Medicaid or CHIP, created in 1997. Both pay for services such as routine checkups, vaccinations, and hospital stays. Medicaid also covers pregnant people before and after they give birth and pays for more than 40% of all births.",
      "Medicaid also covers people with disabilities or complex medical needs and helps them afford services that allow them to live independently in community settings, outside of institutions such as nursing homes and state-run hospitals.",
      "The program serves a diverse cross section of the country. About 40% of people under 65 who use Medicaid are white, 30% are Hispanic, 19% are Black, and 1% are Indigenous people.",
      "Federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to cover immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission, though some states, as well as Washington, D.C.,\u00a0have used their own funds\u00a0to extend Medicaid coverage to such individuals. California was the first state to do so.",
      "What are the income qualifications?",
      "Eligibility generally depends on whether a person is low income, and states have different ways of defining that. For a four-adult household without dependent children, the current national median coverage level is $44,367.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, which passed in 2010, allowed more people to qualify for Medicaid on the basis of income. This is what is known as \"Medicaid expansion.\"",
      "The law offered states a sizable incentive to add more people to their programs: The federal government would pitch in more money per enrollee to help cover them.",
      "The intention behind the expansion was to close gaps in health insurance programs for the millions of Americans who don't get coverage through an employer. Medicaid would cover people with extremely low incomes, and as their incomes rose, they could move to subsidized health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.",
      "In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court said the decision of whether to expand the program would be\u00a0left up to individual states. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 led by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 have opted in.",
      "In the\u00a010 states that haven't expanded\u00a0Medicaid to more low-income adults, the median earnings qualification level is $5,947 a year for a single-person household in 2025. Those who make more are not eligible.",
      "Adults in those states who make too much for Medicaid can also make too little to qualify for help buying plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, leaving some unable to afford coverage. An estimated 1.5 million fall into this coverage gap.",
      "Where does the money to pay for it come from?",
      "The federal government pays most of the cost of Medicaid by matching a portion of what states spend.",
      "Currently, the federal government matches at least 50% of state spending and offers states more money for some services and enrollees \u2014 for instance, for children and pregnant women.",
      "Less wealthy states \u2014 determined by considering residents' per capita incomes \u2014 receive a higher match, translating to a higher percentage of federal dollars. In Mississippi, for instance, the federal government picks up\u00a077% of the cost\u00a0of Medicaid.",
      "States also receive a 90% match from the federal government for enrollees eligible for Medicaid under the ACA's expansion.",
      "There is no limit on how much states can spend on the program, and hundreds of billions of federal dollars flow into states each year. In 2023, states\u00a0spent about 15%\u00a0of their own budgets on Medicaid.",
      "What does that money pay for?",
      "Federal law requires all state Medicaid programs to cover certain services, including emergency medical transportation, X-rays and lab work, family planning, and medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorder. The program also covers many nursing and home health services, though federal law allows those benefits\u00a0to be clawed back\u00a0after an enrollee's death.",
      "Beyond that, states have the flexibility to choose the services their Medicaid programs cover. All states cover prescription drugs, and most cover eyeglasses, some dental care, and physical therapy.",
      "Medicaid covers more mental health and long-term care services than any other type of insurance, public or private.",
      "What is Medicaid called in my state?",
      "Medicaid programs can go by\u00a0many different names, even within the same state, in part because most states use private insurance companies to run them. This can be confusing for consumers who may not realize they are actually enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "In\u00a0New York, for instance, Medicaid plans are offered by major companies, such as Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare \u2014 and some you may not have heard of, such as Amida Care and MetroPlusHealth. In Wisconsin, enrollees may be in BadgerCare Plus; in Connecticut, Husky Health; in Texas, STAR; and in California, Medi-Cal.",
      "How does Medicaid affect hospitals and doctors in my state?",
      "Medicaid generally pays health care providers such as doctors and hospitals less money for services than Medicare or private insurance does. But it can be more money than they'd get caring for people who are uninsured \u2014 and without Medicaid, many more Americans would be uninsured.",
      "Like states, providers and hospitals have come to rely on this money and express concerns that even phasing it out over time would require major adjustments.",
      "What's going to happen to Medicaid?",
      "It's not clear. Republicans in Washington are again pushing for major changes, which could take the form of cuts to federal funding. That could reduce the number of people who qualify, the services available, or both. A similar push focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare in 2017, during Trump's first term, was unsuccessful.",
      "Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to changing Medicaid is\u00a0its popularity: 77% of Americans \u2014 and majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 view the program favorably.",
      "At the heart of it all are key questions about the role of government in people's health: How big should the U.S. medical insurance safety net be? Who deserves government assistance? And how will enrollees, states, providers, and the health care system at large absorb major changes to Medicaid, even if a rollout were staggered?",
      "KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Trump's hardline trade policies.",
      "At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",
      "The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.",
      "Mr. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as \"nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs \"country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Mr. Trump is commandeering the process.",
      "The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened \u2014 and delayed until March 4 \u2014 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.

    "story": [
      "When President Trump issued sweeping pardons to some 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants on his first day in office, his action did not distinguish between those who peacefully wandered the Capitol grounds four years earlier and those who engaged in violence against police.",
      "Now, critics of the move are raising concerns about the dangers posed by some of those convicted of violent felonies who have been released with no plan, and none of the monitoring or restrictions that typically accompany a more traditional parole process.",
      "\"I'm just afraid that I'm going to come home from work one night and he's going to be right there. He's going to be right there sitting on my porch,\" said Shantelle Holeton, a 43-year-old factory worker who says she voted for Trump three times.",
      "Holeton, who spoke with CBS exclusively, said she was abused by Jan. 6 defendant Peter Schwartz in 2019. He was charged and convicted for threatening her.",
      "Then in 2023, a federal judge handed Schwartz one of the longest sentences of any Capitol riot defendant \u2014 more than 14 years in prison on charges that included four counts of assaulting police officers.",
      "Body camera footage from Capitol Hill police during the riot show Schwartz spraying officers with pepper spray and wielding a baton. In court filings, the Department of Justice said he threw the first chair at officers, creating an opening that enabled hundreds of rioters to push back police lines.",
      "Federal prosecutors described Schwartz as \"one of the most violent and aggressive participants in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol,\" and as someone who \"has a long history of assaulting police officers and women.\"",
      "Prior to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Schwartz had amassed a lengthy criminal record that included previous clashes with police. CBS News reviewed dozens of Schwartz' convictions in more than four states for crimes including domestic violence, threatening his girlfriend, and assaulting security officers.",
      "CBS News made repeated efforts to contact Schwartz through his defense lawyer, known associates and family members. He did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0 He has appeared in public proclaiming his innocence from the charges that led to his Jan. 6 conviction.",
      "\"A lot of us that were Jan. Sixers were actually innocent,\" Schwartz claimed in an interview with right-wing influencer Christopher Key, days after being released from prison.",
      "Speaking about the mass pardons of Jan 6 rioters during a press conference on Air Force One last week, President Trump said, \"what I did was a great thing for humanity. They were treated very, very unfairly.\"",
      "The White House would not say whether anyone had reviewed Schwartz's case before issuing him a pardon.",
      "\"President Trump campaigned on pardoning January 6th protestors, won the election with an overwhelming mandate, and delivered on his promise,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Dozens of defendants with criminal histories",
      "Since Trump's mass pardon on Jan. 20, several defendants have had incidents with law enforcement or other legal troubles. Matthew Huttle, who was sentenced to six months in prison for his actions at the Capitol, was killed by a police officer while resisting arrest during a traffic stop in Indiana last month. Elizabeth Hernandez, sentenced to 30 days in federal prison for her role in Jan. 6, was recently handed a 10-year prison sentence for a fatal DUI in Missouri in 2022.",
      "There are no reports that Schwartz has re-offended in the weeks since his release.",
      "Shortly before Schwartz was pardoned, an appeals court reversed only one of the 11 charges against him, and none of the assault charges. Schwartz has been citing the appeals court decision as proof of his innocence while appearing on right-wing media shows.",
      "Schwartz is not the only Jan. 6 defendant with an extensive criminal history. A CBS News analysis of hundreds of sentencing documents found that at least 159 of pardoned Jan. 6 defendants had criminal records prior to that day. That includes at least 41 people who had been convicted of at least one violent crime prior to their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "\"There were a lot of folks who had no criminal history,\" said Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor involved in more than 50 Jan. 6-related cases.",
      "\"There were a lot of other defendants, however, who had extensive histories of domestic abuse, histories of assaulting police officers for whom assaulting the police on January 6th was not the first time they had assaulted police.\"",
      "Allegations of domestic violence, threats",
      "Holeton says she met Schwartz on Facebook in 2019 and moved in with him in Owensboro, Kentucky, after several months of dating long distance. She says it was perfect for two weeks, and then things changed.",
      "\"I made a comment about how tall the corn had gotten in a week. We lived right across from a cornfield, and that comment started the argument that got me beat up,\" Holeton said.",
      "Holeton alleges Schwartz beat her. She says the violence persisted until she called the police in July 2019 when she alleged Schwartz was threatening to kill her and her son. Photos taken by the Kentucky State Police, and reviewed by CBS News, show numerous firearms belonging to Schwartz found on the property. Schwartz was eventually charged and convicted for \"terroristic threatening\" and possessing a handgun.",
      "Even when Schwartz was in prison, Holeton said she was afraid.",
      "\"I walked around the house with a big butcher knife, because I was afraid that they were just gonna let him out and he was just gonna show up,\" she said.",
      "According to a 2015 incident report, Schwartz also threatened police, reportedly telling an officer in Owensboro, \"I am going to shoot you right in the head.\"",
      "In another police report from 2020, Schwartz's then girlfriend, Shelly Stallings, alleged Schwartz bit her forehead and then continued to punch her in the head. In police bodycam footage, reviewed by CBS News, Stallings can be heard saying, \"I locked him out because I couldn't control him, I don't want to be beat up. \u2026 He just gets violent.\" Schwartz was later convicted of domestic violence.",
      "Holeton was not surprised when she heard Schwartz had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"He found an opportunity to go and be violent,\" she said. \"That man thrives on violence. He thrives on people fearing him.\"",
      "Two years later, when Holeton heard that Schwartz would be in prison for more than a decade, she said she felt a huge weight had been lifted. She took to TikTok and Facebook to share an old photo of her battered face and a screenshot of Schwartz's sentencing, with the caption, \"whether you agree with the J6 prisoners or not, myself and all the other women he beat on finally got some justice.\"",
      "\"I was like, oh, well, at least I don't have to worry about him just showing up at my house for the next 14 years,\" said Holeton, who did not want to share her specific location out of concern for her safety.",
      "\"He is not a hero\"",
      "Holeton, a registered Democrat, said she has voted for President Trump in the past three elections. She said she decided to vote for him in 2024 because she thought he would improve the economy, and she believed his administration would only pardon Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis.",
      "In an interview on Fox News in early January, Vice President-elect JD Vance said those who protested peacefully should be pardoned, but he made an exception for rioters who engaged in violence.",
      "\"If you committed violence that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,\" he said. But Vance later told CBS News he supported the president's action, saying it \"rectified a wrong.\"",
      "Holeton believes, \"Most of those people should have been allowed to go home, but not people like Pete.\"",
      "\"The idea of pardoning people who had criminal histories, violent histories, it's a really poor choice if you're thinking about public safety going forward,\" said Manning.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House said in a legal filing that Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't an employee of its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order that directs his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, for Americans struggling with fertility.",
      "At an event at Mar-a-Lago, White House staff secretary Will Scharf told reporters that the order directs the Domestic Policy Council \"to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.\" The order requests that the council make policy recommendations within 90 days to protect access to IVF and \"aggressively\" reduce costs for the treatment.",
      "\"These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or been unaffordable for many Americans,\" Scharf said.",
      "Health insurance companies are not currently required to cover IVF treatments, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "The executive order said it's the Trump administration's policy to \"ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump vowed during the 2024 campaign that the treatments would either be covered by the government or insurance companies if he was reelected.",
      "\"Your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment,\" Mr. Trump said in August 2024.",
      "Weeks after Mr. Trump made the pledge, Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have protected access to IVF and made the fertility treatments more affordable. Republicans said the legislation was too broad and only two GOP senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 supported it.",
      "\"Republicans support IVF, full stop,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, who was then the minority whip, said at the time, calling the vote \"an attempt by Democrats to try and create a political issue where there isn't one.\"",
      "The issue of access to fertility treatments became a political flashpoint last February after the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos were considered children under state law. The ruling caused an uproar and cleared the way for potential wrongful death claims if an embryo did not survive the process, causing several providers to pause IVF treatments.

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday declined to stop Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected a request for a temporary restraining order sought by 14 Democrat-led states as they pursue a challenge to Musk's actions. The states have argued that Musk, who the White House said is categorized as a special government employee, has unchecked authority and is violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "But in a 10-page decision, Chutkan found that the states have failed to show that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief.",
      "\"The court is aware that DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,\" she wrote. \"But the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Chutkan, though, added that the states' claim that Musk's actions violate Appointments Clause has \"serious implications.\" Citing Supreme Court precedent, she wrote that they are the \"executive abuses\" that the constitutional provision seeks to prevent.",
      "\"Musk has not been nominated by the president nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise 'significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,'\" she said. \"Bypassing this 'significant structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme,' Musk has rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the Executive Branch.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order establishing the Musk-led DOGE on his first day in office and tasked the agency with reducing the size of the government and cutting federal spending. Since then, DOGE's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies to implement Mr. Trump's agenda. In a court filing on Monday, the White House sought to clarify that Musk is not the formal head of DOGE, but oversees the effort as a senior White House adviser.",
      "DOGE's actions raised alarms for Democrats and labor unions representing federal workers after it was revealed that Musk and his team had gained access to government systems. Musk has publicly called for entire agencies to be \"deleted,\" and DOGE has claimed on social media that it is responsible for contracts being canceled.",
      "In an effort to combat DOGE's efforts, several states and the unions have filed federal lawsuits seeking to stop the task force from having access to information and payment systems.",
      "The case before Chutkan was filed last week and claims that Musk's actions are a violation of the Appointments Clause and exceed the scope of his authority.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X, is an \"unelected, unconfirmed government official\" who is \"exercising unprecedented executive authority,\" the states said in a court filing.",
      "\"An individual accountable only to the president \u2014 if he answers to anyone at all \u2014 is exercising apparently limitless power within the Executive Branch,\" the states wrote in their complaint. \"Mr. Musk's conduct has wreaked havoc on the federal government and caused mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees, the American public, and people around the world who depend on the United States for leadership and support.\"",
      "The states asked Chutkan to issue a temporary restraining order that would temporarily bar Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at the Office of Personnel Management and the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, Transportation and Commerce. They also asked her to prevent him from terminating, furloughing or placing on involuntary leave any federal employees at those agencies.",
      "The Justice Department, though, argued that the states cannot identify any imminent, irreparable harm \u2014 one of the four factors they have to prove to receive relief \u2014 that warranted the court's intervention. The Trump administration also said the relief sought by the states was too broad and would sweep in anyone affiliated with DOGE, including Mr. Trump and Senate-confirmed administration officials.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the states' claim that Musk has the authority to make decisions for the government is \"wrong,\" and \"rests entirely on conflating influence and authority.\"",
      "\"An advisor does not become an officer simply because the officer listens to his advice. And stripped of their lengthy rhetoric, the states do not actually cite a single example of where Elon Musk (or anyone at USDS) has been given formal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States,\" they wrote, referring to the U.S. DOGE Service, the entity's formal name.",
      "A declaration filed by Joshua Fisher, director of the White House's Office of Administration, noted that Musk serves as a senior advisor to the president, as well as a special government employee. He has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" Fisher stated in the filing. Musk is also not the administrator of DOGE, according to the declaration.",
      "Chutkan held a hearing to consider the states' request on Monday, and she appeared skeptical that the states had shown that they would be imminently harmed by Musk and DOGE's actions.",
      "A \"generalized fear that this is going to happen, even if it looks like it's likely to happen,\" is not enough to satisfy the need for a temporary restraining order, she said.",
      "\"I'm not seeing it so far,\" Chutkan told a lawyer for the states, adding that they were effectively seeking a \"prophylactic\" temporary restraining order, which she said is \"not allowed.\"",
      "But Anjana Samant, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which is leading the suit, called DOGE and its actions a \"one-of-a-kind situation.\"",
      "The nation has never experienced \"this type of wielding of power in this way,\" she said",
      "Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president nor confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Musk, Chutkan said, is a private citizen tasked with directing an organization, DOGE, to have access to \"the entire workings of the federal government.\" She noted that, according to the states, the task force has fired workers, cut contracts and terminated programs, \"all without apparently any congressional oversight.\"",
      "\"The allegation isn't that agencies can't manage their own workforce,\" she said. \"The allegation is that DOGE is coming into these agencies and accessing data and firing people, terminating contracts. They're essentially running the government. That's the problem.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday that the Senate will move forward with a vote on a budget proposal to begin enacting President Trump's agenda this week, moving ahead of Republicans in the House who are pursuing a competing plan.",
      "\"It's time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,\" Thune said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon, adding that \"[s]ecuring the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy\" will begin \"this week.\"",
      "The Senate's budget resolution is the first of two the chamber intends to pursue under the reconciliation process. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy, while the second will address the extension of the 2017 tax cuts.",
      "The House is also moving forward with its own budget resolution, which would address the border security, defense, energy and tax priorities in a single bill. That could see a vote on the House floor as soon as next week.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee marked up its resolution last week, voting to advance it to the floor on Wednesday. During the committee meeting, the panel's chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina touted the legislation, outlining that it would allow $175 billion to be spent on border security and $150 billion on military capabilities, while instructing committees to find reconciliation-compliant offsets to cut mandatory spending outside of Social Security.",
      "Graham acknowledged that while \"there's been a bit of debate between the House and the Senate about what to do and why,\" he decided to move forward with the budget resolution due to a \"sense of urgency\" about implementing Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,\" Graham said. \"And to my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill meeting the priorities of President Trump and what we've been promising to do as a party. But we've got to move on this issue.\"",
      "The House also advanced its own budget proposal out of committee last week, which includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, spending cuts of at least $1.5 trillion and an increase of the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The House is away this week on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when lawmakers return next week.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise urged in a post on X shortly after Thune's announcement Tuesday that it's \"time to act on ALL of the powerful mandates\" that voters delivered to Mr. Trump in November's election. The Louisiana Republican touted the many components that would be included \"in one big, beautiful bill\" that will start moving when the House approves its own budget.",
      "Thune's announcement on Tuesday that the Senate will vote on the proposal as soon as this week marks a step forward. But approving the budget resolution is just one hurdle in the reconciliation process.",
      "Reconciliation allows lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that makes advancing partisan legislation extremely difficult. But in order to use it, lawmakers must first approve identical budget resolutions through both chambers and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The legislation can ultimately include only provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, and settles disputes over whether a provision has direct budgetary consequences.",
      "Despite support among Senate Republicans for a two-bill approach, House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the budget resolution. During the committee markup, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called the resolution \"pro-billionaire, anti-middle class,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, saying he expects an \"effort to keep the Medicaid cuts hidden behind the curtain, but they're going to come sooner or later.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:54:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:21:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 1.5%, and the European agency putting it at around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "title": "Vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer shows promise in new study",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 3.1%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "title": "Study finds growing levels of microplastics in human brains",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "title": "Odds of \"city-killer\" asteroid hitting Earth in 2032 rise, then fall again, NASA says",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:54:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a01.5% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA said it expects the probability \"to continue to evolve\" as scientists gather new observations of the asteroid in the days and weeks ahead.",

      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",

      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 3.1%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",

    "story": [
      "Over 6,000 Internal Revenue Service employees are expected to be terminated by the end of this week, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans. More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "The IRS will be carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",

We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House. The program is facing legal challenges, but a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in early February that the program could continue.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities on Wednesday, an address that transpired as the Trump Organization seeks to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia and as the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "The president's speech came a day after the U.S. and Russia held talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on how to end the war in Ukraine, and the administration is seeking Saudi Arabia's cooperation on a range of issues, including the war in Gaza. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years in a phone call with Mr. Trump shortly after he took office in January.",
      "The\u00a0FII PRIORITY Summit\u00a0in Miami Beach is billed as an opportunity for \"thought leaders, investors and policymakers\" to come together and \"unleash extraordinary value creation.\" The Saudi Public Investment Fund is the main backer of the Miami conference, along with other Saudi government entities, including the Saudi Ministry of Investment and Riyad Bank, which the Saudi government controls.",
      "Led by the crown prince, the Saudi Public Investment Fund reportedly invested $2 billion in Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm after Mr. Trump left the White House in 2021. The fund is also a major backer of LIV Golf, which has held several tournaments at Trump golf courses.",
      "The Trump family businesses' ties with the Saudis raise questions about why he's delivering the speech, and whether the president's business interests might influence how he manages the relationship with the nation's authoritarian leadership.",
      "\"You kind of have to question when you see something like this, is this being done to advance Trump's business interests, or is there a reason America wants a president there?\" Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Government or CREW, said of Mr. Trump's speech.",
      "\"The president's involved in business deals in a foreign country and you've got to wonder, what's he putting first, his business or Americans'?\" Libowitz asked.",
      "The president began his speech by touting his properties in the Miami area, before mentioning Middle Eastern leaders, but he only acknowledged Saudi Arabia and its leaders by name. The president nodded \"in particular the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a special place with special leaders\" and mentioned Saudi finance minister Mohammad Al-Jadaan.",
      "Mr. Trump pointed out that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, was seated next to his right-hand man, billionaire Elon Musk in the audience. He also gave a nod to his son-in-law and former Middle East point person, Jared Kushner, \"a very special guy.\"",
      "He thanked Saudi Arabia for doing a \"great job\" in hosting the talks on Russia and Ukraine and the crown prince, and he again bashed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a\u00a0\"dictator.\"\u00a0The White House also said bin Salman played a role in the recent release of an American detained in Russia, Marc Fogel.",
      "The president reiterated his plan to give businesses that manufacture their products in the U.S. lower tax corporate tax rates.",
      "\"I come today with a simple message for business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If you want to build the future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries or make a fortune. Do you want to make a fortune? Most of you have already made a fortune, I don't want to say. There's no better place on earth than the current and future United States of America under a certain president named Donald J. Trump,\" he said.",
      "The president also lauded his administration's work to deport illegal immigrants, and Musk's work to slash the size of government \u2014 his goal is to cut up to $2 trillion in spending. The president floated the idea of giving 20% of the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency back to Americans.",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said, although 20% of those savings would only put a small dent in the federal debt, which is currently over $36 trillion. It's unclear where the other 60% would go.",
      "The institute hosting the Miami conference did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News, nor did the Saudi embassy.",
      "Asked why the president chose to speak at the event, a White House official told CBS News ahead of the speech that the president would be \"encouraging investment in the United States.\"",
      "Business ties to the Saudis",
      "The president handed over day-to-day operations of the Trump Organization to his children and placed his assets in a trust before taking office in January, similar to an arrangement he made before his first term. But he has declined to fully divest from his business interests, raising questions about the potential for conflicts of interest in his dealings with foreign entities.",
      "Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, announced the Jeddah deal in December. He told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "\"What I'll tell you is one of them will definitely be a tower,\" Eric Trump told the news agency, declining to offer other details.",
      "Kushner, who handled Middle East affairs for Mr. Trump in the White House during the first Trump term, grew close with the Saudi crown prince, despite the CIA assessing as far back as 2018 that bin Salman, known as MBS, approved the murder of Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi.",
      "Kushner recently dismissed any conflict of interest concerns about the Saudi investment fund's stake in his private equity firm, Affinity Partners. He also scoffed when asked if he believed a declassified U.S. intelligence report released in 2021 that found the crown prince approved the killing of Khashoggi. Kushner said he has not seen the report.",
      "\"Are we really still doing this?\" Kushner first replied last week when asked if he believed the U.S. intelligence report pointing to MBS.",
      "The Saudi-funded LIV Golf league, which has held talks to merge with the PGA Tour, is scheduled to hold a tournament at the Trump National Doral in April, after hosting multiple events at Trump properties in recent years. Mr. Trump has deflected criticism of his involvement with the Saudi-backed tournament by casting doubt on the Saudis' involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying, \"Well, nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have.\"",
      "Human Rights Watch specifically names the Saudis' involvement with LIV as a serious concern, saying the country is trying to \"'sportswash' its egregious human rights record.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump met with the PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan at the White House, with a potential deal between the PGA Tour and LIV subject to scrutiny by federal regulators.",
      "\"We are grateful that his leadership has brought us closer to a final deal, paving the way for reunification of men's professional golf,\" Monahan and players Tiger Woods and Adam Scott said in a statement after the meeting.",
      "Ethical and national security questions",
      "Libowitz suggested that a sitting U.S. president with business interests that involve a foreign government complicates the relationship.",
      "\"Look, you're not going to be able to do major business deals in a country, particularly an authoritarian country, if that country doesn't want you to,\" Libowitz said.",
      "Presidents aren't subject to the federal statute prohibiting federal employees from participating in government matters that could affect their financial interests or those of their families, said Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at the George Washington University Law School.",
      "\"The president just doesn't have any of those limitations that you would traditionally see of an executive branch federal employee,\" Tillipman said.",
      "Still, it's traditionally been a norm that a president would divest himself from his business interests, or place some interests in a blind trust.",
      "\"We've seen no indication that the president intends to separate himself from his existing financial interests,\" Tillipman said. \"Again, he's not legally required to do any of this.\"",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said Mr. Trump's failure to properly divest from his business holdings raise not only ethical concerns, but national security ones.",
      "\"Trump has not properly divested from his business holdings and recently announced a new hotel in Saudi Arabia,\" Amey said. \"The Trump Organization's website sells tickets to the Saudi-owned golf league event at Trump's Miami golf course. Every meeting that involves current or potential business partners or investors is a conflict. These entanglements raise numerous ethics concerns as well as national security concerns because we are talking about Saudi interests where there is even less of a distinction between the ruling family and their businesses.\"",

      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",

    "summary": "Ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an uncommon style of giving that has brought meaningful change to charities, a new report finds.",
    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:05:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The initial accounting by DOGE of its estimated savings was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
    "story": [
      "After repeated delays, the Department of Government Efficiency on Monday released a \"wall of receipts\" \u2014 what it characterized as documentation of the money saved by the slashing cuts to jobs and contracts pushed by Elon Musk's team at DOGE over the past several weeks.",
      "The initial accounting was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
      "Among the errors were contracts that DOGE identified for cuts, saying the move could save billions for taxpayers. But they were actually standard government funding vehicles called \"indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity\" contracts. The DOGE team misread these specialized contracts, experts told CBS News, and as a result overstated their push for savings by as much as $1.96 billion.",
      "A closer inspection of another big so-called savings: the cancellation of a contract DOGE identified as worth $8 billion was in fact worth only $8 million. This single mistake slashed the receipts of savings DOGE said it had identified in half \u2014 to $8.4 billion.",
      "That error involved an award for Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Equal Opportunity Employment Office, and the contract described the project as \"Program and Technical Support Services for Office of Diversity and Civil Rights.\" In his first days in office, President Trump signed executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.",
      "The DOGE team led by Musk has become a hallmark of Mr. Trump's early days in office, as members of the efficiency team set up shop in federal agencies to identify cuts of employees, grants and contracts. The president has praised the effort, which he says is a long overdue move to eliminate waste.",
      "\"They're doing a hell of a job, it's an amazing job they're doing,\" he said during remarks in the Oval Office on Feb. 11. \"You know that force is building, I call it 'the force of super geniuses.'\"",
      "DOGE's accounting error involving indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, known in government-speak as IDIQ, occurred because the team likely misunderstood how government contracting works, experts told CBS News. These contracts are designed to set a ceiling for the funding of a larger project.",
      "Multiple contractors bid on tasks within that IDIQ. The ceiling for the project identified by DOGE was $655 million. But DOGE claimed savings of $654,990,000 three times. In actuality, the government spent less on the contract \u2014 around $400 million over the course of the past four years for 44 different sub-contracts\u00a0\u2014 and the IDIQ is likely to have only minimal additional spending.",
      "That specific contract was called USAID EVAL-ME II IDIQ and it provided \"monitoring, evaluation and learning services to promote evidence-based decision making for adaptive management across USAID.\" One of the contractors involved told CBS News that this program was directly responsible for ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money was spent in accordance with U.S. goals and interests.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the discrepancy, and DOGE also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE \"may be more interested in inflating savings than in accurately reporting them,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight.",
      "The New York Times, which first reported DOGE's $8 billion accounting error, pointed out that a 2022 version of this contract was listed at $8 billion, and on Jan. 22 of this year, the figure was changed to $8 million. The contracting company, D&G Solutions, confirmed to CBS News that this was originally the result of an accounting error and that $3.8 million of the contract had already been expended.",
      "On Wednesday morning, DOGE fixed the error, and the website now shows $8 million in savings for that contract, but the link they provide for the \"receipt\" is to the earlier $8 billion figure.",
      "Musk recently admitted he knows DOGE isn't perfect. Defending DOGE during an Oval Office appearance on Feb. 11, he said that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected.\"",
      "\"Nobody's going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes,\" he added.",
      "Beyond the ICE contract blunder, Amey described the numbers as underwhelming. Excluding the impact of USAID's elimination, receipts of contract savings from other agencies appear to total $2 billion \u2014 a fraction of the federal budget, which stands at $6.75 trillion.",
      "\"If DOGE's goal is to trim a trillion or two, it has a long way to go, and Congress has to do its job to cut spending, too,\" Amey said. Musk has said he'd like to trim $2 trillion, putting DOGE at 0.1% of his goal.",
      "Many of these contract cancellations, outside of the USAID cuts, appear to have been selected based on language in the agreements referencing diversity, equity, or inclusion, CBS News' review found.",
      "And at what cost? Among the receipts on the DOGE wall was funding for a\u00a0 Department of Education project that's now been scrapped. The contractor described the real-world consequences in an interview: \"Thirteen school districts across 11 states were set to receive more than $13 million to support over 1,070 youth with disabilities participating in the program.\"",
      "At USAID, savings touted by DOGE\u00a0 on X on Saturday included $10 million for \"Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcision\" and $9.7M for UC Berkeley to develop \"a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise driven skills\" amongst other cuts. Circumcision has been proved to reduce the spread of HIV by as much as 60%. Programs like that have the potential to significantly lower costs for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, which provides antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS and had been given a limited waiver to continue to operate at the end of January. It has been credited with helping to save 26 million lives. One 2017 estimate suggested that widespread circumcision efforts could avert 3.6 million new HIV infections and save $16.5 billion.",
      "DOGE has for weeks been promising an accounting of the unprecedented sweep through federal agencies that appears to have left hundreds of workers suddenly jobless.",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's abrupt firings have set government agencies on edge. The government is now trying to rehire hundreds of workers in the U.S. nuclear weapons program after last week's layoffs. Farmers across the U.S. remain in limbo after promised federal funds for healthy soil initiatives \u2014 amounting to thousands of dollars per farm \u2014 failed to materialize.

      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator without elections,\" echoing rhetoric from the Kremlin about the war in Ukraine and escalating a public feud between the two leaders.",
      "In a post on Truth Social\u00a0on Wednesday, Mr. Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy, accusing him of duping the U.S. into providing billions in aid to Ukraine and misusing it.",
      "\"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump inflated the amount of assistance the U.S. has sent to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022. The U.S. has provided $66 billion in security assistance. In total, Congress has appropriated $175 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine in 2019 with 73% of the vote. The country has delayed elections that were scheduled for early 2024 because of the war with Russia. One recent public opinion poll in Ukraine showed 57% of Ukrainians said they trust Zelenskyy, compared to 37% who said they don't.",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's attack on Zelenskyy was a direct response to the Ukrainian president saying that Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a Russian-created \"disinformation space.\"",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's comment came a day after Mr. Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, falsely claiming Ukraine was run by \"neo-Nazis\" who posed a threat to Russia and its neighbors.",
      "U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia earlier this week about ending the war. Ukrainian officials were not included in the meeting.",
      "On Capitol Hill, several Republican senators disagreed with Mr. Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would \"never refer to President Zelenskyy as a dictator.\" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Zelenskyy is not to blame for Russia's invasion \"in any way.\"",
      "\"To equate anybody or to suggest that anyone in Ukraine has responsibility for this war forgets the fact that Putin lied,\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said. \"He has lied every step of the way, and I believe any resolution in Ukraine that makes him feel like he won or just pushed to a tie is a bad idea.\"",
      "Mike Pence, who served as Mr. Trump's vice president during his first term, also spoke out against the president's comments, sharing a Fox News article from Feb. 24, 2022, with the headline \"Russia Invades Ukraine in Largest European Attack Since WWII.\"",
      "\"Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war,\" Pence wrote. \"Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.\"",

    "summary": "Pope Francis, despite a worrying bilateral pneumonia diagnosis, is breathing on his own and not experiencing heart problems, sources tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 The Vatican said Wednesday that Pope Francis had spent a peaceful night in a Rome hospital \u2014 his fifth after being admitted with a bout of bronchitis that has developed into pneumonia in both lungs. Tuesday's bilateral pneumonia diagnosis would be a worrying turn for any 88-year-old, but it is of particular concern for the leader of the Catholic Church, who has long suffered from respiratory problems.",
      "Pope Francis rested well, woke up and ate breakfast Wednesday morning, the Vatican said. A source at the institution said the pontiff was not suffering heart problems and was breathing on his own, without the aid of a respirator. They said he was sitting up in an armchair at times, and it was understood that he's under strict orders from his medical team to rest.",
      "The Vatican said later Wednesday the pope was in stable condition and blood tests had shown a slight improvement, specifically with inflammation markers.",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Francis on Wednesday afternoon, and the two spoke privately for 20 minutes, the Vatican said. Close aides have also been bringing him documents to review and sign.",
      "Another source told CBS News that Francis had been making a number of phone calls, and he's also been receiving notes from well-wishers.",
      "People have been gathering outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to show their support, too, with many leaving messages and notes near a statue of former Pope John Paul II. The Vatican also shared a selection of photos Wednesday showing some of the drawings and notes of support that children being treated at Gemelli's pediatric oncology unit have sent to the pope.",
      "The pope has always kept a very busy schedule, and he appeared breathless at some of his public events earlier in the month, before being admitted to the hospital on Friday for what was first diagnosed as bronchitis.",
      "The new diagnosis confirmed on Tuesday, of pneumonia in both of his lungs, came a day after the Vatican said the pontiff had a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract and that test results were \"indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an adequate hospital stay.\"",
      "The Vatican said Tuesday that the pneumonia would require additional drug therapy. The illness was discovered after Francis underwent a CT scan of his chest on Tuesday afternoon, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican has said Francis is thankful for the \"closeness he feels at this moment\" from his supporters, and that he asked for people to pray for him.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican has canceled an audience Francis was scheduled to have on Saturday and announced that he wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, either.",
      "The pope's continuing hospitalization comes just over two weeks before the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",
      "Just before Easter last year, Francis declined to attend a Good Friday procession at Rome's Colosseum in a bid to conserve his health, but the pope later led tens of thousands of worshipers in Easter celebrations.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:49:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Moscow gloats, Ukraine's leader says Trump is operating in a Russian \"disinformation space\" as the U.S. president echoes Putin's own defense of his war.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, speaking Tuesday afternoon from his home in Florida, appeared to shift three years \u2014 if not many decades \u2014 of U.S. foreign policy almost 180 degrees, issuing remarks that made his administration sound aligned more with Russian President Vladimir Putin than America's European allies of the last eight decades.",
      "In rhetoric similar to claims Putin has used himself to justify his three-year\u00a0war on Ukraine, Mr. Trump seemed to blame President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Russia's full-scale invasion after the Ukrainian leader took issue with being left out of initial conversations between the White House and Moscow, which began Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well. Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years \u2014 you should have never started it,\" Mr. Trump chided Zelenskyy. \"You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land. Everything, almost all of the land. And no people would have been killed and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.\"",
      "\"This is, frankly, what Vladimir Putin would have said \u2014 that none of this needed to happen, when in fact, it happened because he wanted it to happen,\" Ravi Agrawal, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, told CBS News' Major Garrett after hearing Mr. Trump's remarks.",
      "Zelenskyy reacted Wednesday, saying Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a \"disinformation space\" fostered by Russia.",
      "Putin, who first sent forces into Ukraine in 2014 and seized control of its Crimean Peninsula in a unilateral annexation never recognized by the U.S. or most of the world, has claimed he was forced to launch his full-scale attack on the neighboring nation due to a threat posed by the U.S.-led NATO alliance spreading its influence eastward toward Russia's border.",
      "The U.S. and its European NATO allies have always dismissed that excuse, insisting that Putin's real intention ahead of the February 2022 full-scale invasion was always to seize more of Ukraine's sovereign territory and delegitimize Zelenskyy's pro-Western government.",
      "\"NATO consists of 32 countries and NATO's position is that it [war in Ukraine] was unprovoked,\" U.S. Navy Adm. Stuart B. Munsch, commander of JFC Naples, one of NATO's three Joint Force Commands, said Wednesday in Romania when asked about Mr. Trump's remarks. Munsch \u2014 one of the U.S. Navy's longest-serving active duty officers \u2014 is in Romania this week for a NATO military exercise aimed at preparing the alliance for any further Russian aggression on Europe's far eastern flank.",
      "Mr. Trump has made fiery rhetoric, and sometimes a loose adherence to fact, a hallmark of his negotiating tactics with foreign powers \u2014 including a baseless claim from his Mar-a-Lago mansion on Tuesday that Zelenskyy's approval rating had dipped to 4%, when domestic polling in Ukraine shows it over 50%. That lines up with Kremlin propaganda, along with a call for Ukraine to hold new elections and a suggestion it should have done so already, despite the country's constitution making a vote impossible under the current state of emergency sparked by Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarkable espousal of Russian rhetoric has fueled rising concern in Europe that the U.S. could be shifting the enormous weight of its geopolitical and security influence away from the deep-rooted democracies of the West, toward the autocratic rulers of the ideologically conservative east, and especially Putin.",
      "The Russian leader's longtime confidant, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, acknowledged the shift Wednesday, lauding Mr. Trump and saying his \"remarks on NATO being the main reason for the conflict in Ukraine are a signal that he understands our position.\"",
      "\"I assume the United States, as discussed yesterday, intends to remove obstacles that are in the path of promising projects. We have begun to move away from the edge of the abyss where Biden's administration led our relationship,\" the veteran Russian diplomat said.",
      "Zelenskyy has softened his stance in recent months, seemingly accepting that he may have to cede some of his country's Russian-occupied territory in an eventual peace deal, but he's made it clear that Ukraine must be involved in the negotiations for a ceasefire agreement, and that his country will need security guarantees from the U.S. and the West to protect it from any future Russian attack.",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he wanted to end the war \"this year,\" but he admonished the Trump administration for helping Russia's autocratic regime to \"break out\" of the isolation it brought upon itself \u2014 in the form of sanctions and cut-off diplomacy \u2014 by launching the unprovoked attack on his country.",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of Zelenskyy later Wednesday, accusing him doing \"a terrible job\" and \u00a0of \"playing\" the Biden administration to convince the U.S. to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \"to go into a War that couldn't be won.\"",
      "Repeating the Kremlin's misleading refrain that Zelenskyy \"refuses to have Elections,\" Mr. Trump went as far as calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" warning the Ukrainian leader that he, \"better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "\"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do,\" argued Mr. Trump.",
      "It was unclear how hard Mr. Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv Wednesday to \"sit and listen\" to Zelenskyy's administration after the Ukrainians were left out of the initial dialogue with the Kremlin, would push the American president's viewpoint that Ukraine could or should have prevented or stopped the war foisted upon it by its far larger, far better armed, autocratically-ruled neighbor.",
      "Upon arriving, Kellogg, a retired three-star general, said it was nice to be visiting Kyiv \"just a few days before the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" seemingly acknowledging which side had initiated the war.",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Kellogg called his visit \"a chance to have some good, substantial talks,\" but what Ukraine will want is a clear indication that the world's biggest military power will somehow protect it from future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy has long said that could come in the form of either NATO membership for his country or NATO forces deployed to enforce a ceasefire.",
      "After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the White House delegation's bilateral talks with Lavrov in Saudia Arabia on Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister said point-blank that the Kremlin wouldn't accept either of those things. Russia has already ruled out any exchange of occupied territory with Ukraine, and it's unclear what concessions the Trump administration could try to win from Russia for a peace deal.",
      "\"We understand the need for security guarantees,\" Kellogg told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Novyny after arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday. \"It's very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well... Part of my mission is to sit and listen.\"",

      "There'd been no immediate explanation Tuesday when the 2021 U.S. Open champion walked to the umpire after the second game, said a few words and then stood in a small space between the back of the official's chair and barrier netting adjacent to Court 2.",
      "Raducanu returned to play after a brief delay at 2-0 down and eventually lost 7-6 (6), 6-4 to 14th-seeded Karolina Muchova.",

    "title": "Over 150 false killer whales stranded on beach can't be saved, experts say",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 10:18:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing 157 false killer whales that stranded on a remote Australian beach.",
    "story": [
      "Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia's island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene near the Arthur River on Tasmania's northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn't have success as the ocean conditions weren't allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\" Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\" Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 1,100 pounds, while the adults weighed over three tons each. Despite their name, false killer whales are one of the largest members of the dolphin family. The whales are large and slender, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and have prominent markings that can allow scientists to identify individuals. A subspecies in the United States is considered endangered. The animals also have strong social bonds and tend to travel in groups, NOAA said.",
      "The reasons for the beachings are unclear. Reasons could include disorientation caused by loud noises, illness, old age, injury, fleeing predators and severe weather.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within six miles of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to be refloated.",
      "\"The water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They're just dying, they've sunk down in the sand,\" Flint said Wednesday morning. \"I think it's too late.",
      "\"There are little babies. Up one end, there's a lot of big ones. It's sad,\" she added.",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "In early 2024, 29 long-finned pilot whales died and about 100 more were rescued after they were beached along the lower tip of Western Australia. In 2023, nearly 100 pilot whales were stranded on a beach in Western Australia. About half were rescued, but re-stranded only hours later. All of the whales wound up dead, CBS News previously reported. In 2022, 230 pilot whales stranded further south on the west coast at Macquarie Harbor. Only 35 survived.",
      "The largest mass stranding in Australian history occurred in the same harbor in 2020 when 470 long-finned pilot whales became stuck on sandbars. Most of the beached whales died on both occasions.",

    "summary": "An investigation is underway into the Delta plane that crash-landed Monday in Toronto. What caused it remains to be seen, but here's what we know so far.",
    "story": [
      "A Delta Air Lines jet crashed Monday during a fiery landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport, skidding down the tarmac before coming to a stop while flipped upside down.",
      "The dramatic scene, captured on video by air traffic controllers and, later, the passengers on board, left 21 people injured \u2014 two critically. What caused it remains under investigation by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which said Tuesday that the aircraft's black boxes have been recovered, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration. Here's what we know so far.",
      "The ceiling of the plane \"had become the floor\"",
      "Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 departed Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota on Monday morning, carrying 76 passengers and four crew members.",
      "The plane, operated by Minneapolis-based Delta Air Lines subsidiary Endeavor Air, struck the landing strip as it arrived at Toronto Airport at about 1:15 p.m. CST, according to Delta. Images and video of the accident showed the CRJ-900 aircraft catch fire when it hit the pavement and proceeded to turn sideways while sliding across the airfield, losing its tail and both wings along the way.",
      "It eventually flipped over and came to a halt. Passengers on the plane have since described hanging upside down, suspended by their fastened seatbelts, with one person recalling how he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor\" after unbuckling.",
      "Emergency teams rushed to the site of the crash, extinguishing the blaze and then evacuating the passengers who were still inside. At a news conference Tuesday, Toronto International Airport president and CEO Deborah Flint praised the Delta flight crew and emergency workers at the airport for launching a \"textbook response\" to the accident \"within minutes.\"",
      "\"The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing that was amidst smoke and fire,\" Flint said. \"Thank you for all that you do every day and every night in service of safe air travel.\"",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian also commended the flight crew and their swift evacuation, calling the circumstances \"horrifying\" in an interview Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "\"You can imagine, when I received the text minutes after it happened, hearing that there was a regional jet upside down on an active runway with 80 people on board, how I felt without knowing yet what was transpiring,\" Bastian said. \"But the reality is, safety is embedded into our system. ... And yes, it's amazing the work that our team did up at Endeavor, but that's what we expect out of them because we are prepared for all types of circumstances.\"",
      "Two people were critically injured",
      "All 80 passengers and crew members on the Delta flight survived the crash. Emergency responders and the flight crew themselves ushered passengers down the aisle of the overturned jet and helped evacuate them through an emergency exit door. More footage from the crash showed passengers climbing out of the aircraft and stepping out onto a snowy tarmac, where powerful winds whipped past.",
      "Officials originally reported that 19 people suffered injuries in the accident, but the number was revised up to 21 between Monday and Tuesday. Flint said 19 people were taken to hospitals in the area for medical treatment immediately after the crash, and two more were admitted later on. Corey Tkatch, commander of operations for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, said some people suffered back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and \"nausea and vomiting due to the fuel exposure.\"",
      "Nineteen of the injured people had been released by Tuesday, according to Delta Air Lines, while two remained hospitalized and their conditions were listed as critical. The exact nature of their injuries has not been released, but Flint told reporters the people hurt on Flight 4819 had a range of injuries considered minor to critical, none of which are life-threatening.",
      "Peel Regional Paramedic Services at first classified a child as injured and in critical condition, but the Hospital for Sick Children later said the child was in good condition.",
      "Toronto was experiencing rough and frigid weather",
      "Evacuees from the plane crash were met with harsh wintry conditions when they exited onto the airfield, with one person likening the environment to tundra weather. Snow and ice coated the tarmac, and powerful, blustery winds could be seen on video.",
      "Meteorologists said Toronto was experiencing blowing snow when the accident occurred, and visibility had been reduced to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 miles per hour and temperatures dropped far below freezing to just 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday that the airport runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions as the Delta flight arrived.",
      "Bastian told \"CBS Mornings\" that the flight crew was an experienced group familiar with Toronto's intense winter weather.",
      "\"All these pilots train for these conditions,\" Bastian said. \"We train for this continuously.\"",
      "Flint on Tuesday said the crash occurred on \"an operational day\" at the Toronto airport, which canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend as a result of heavy snowfall. By Monday, more than 1,000 flights were scheduled, and they resumed at the airport just about three hours after the accident.",
      "Almost two dozen members of Transportation Safety Board of Canada are leading an investigation into the crash and what may have caused it. The United States National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration will also send people from both U.S. agencies to assist in the probe.",
      "Survivors are waiting for answers",
      "Survivors of the crash are waiting for answers about what happened, how it happened and why. A number of people who were on board Flight 4819 have described chaos as the plane made a hard landing, \"went sideways,\" and everyone was suddenly upside down \"hanging like bats\" from their seats.",
      "Matt Cunningham, a passenger on the flight, told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota he was sitting in a window seat about eight rows behind the exits at the front end of the plane. He remembered the passenger seated beside him helping Cunningham unfasten his seatbelt, then falling into the overhead luggage compartments that were below their heads.",
      "\"There was some shouting back and forth, 'Is somebody opening the doors? We need to get off this plane,'\" Cunningham said. \"The smell of jet fuel became very strong. We could see jet fuel going over the windows, pooling up. Seeing the videos today of the fireball we landed in, it just seems inconceivable that we weren't on fire.\"",
      "Cunningham said he texted his family once the plane had stopped moving. The text read: \"Plane crash, please pray.\" About 15 minutes passed before he sent a follow-up message that included photos of the outside of the jet.",
      "\"Talking to my dad today, he said those 15 minutes from the time he got that text until he until he got the next one with some photos that I took away from the plane, were 15 tough minutes,\" Cunningham said Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Other passengers, like John Nelson, captured video of the charred aircraft's exterior after climbing outside. Nelson's recounting of the accident was similar to Cunningham's. Speaking to\u00a0CBS News Minnesota, he described the plane making a hard landing before skidding on its side and flipping over.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, who was also on the plane, shared a video\u00a0on Instagram in which he evacuates with help from the flight crew and then looks back on the upside-down aircraft, repeatedly exclaiming \"Holy f***!\"",

Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night.

      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram.

    "story": [
      "Rio de Janeiro \u2014 Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president.",
      "\"The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'\" Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. \"The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement.",
      "Bolsonaro's defense team said it met the accusations with \"dismay and indignation,\" adding in a statement that the former \"President has never agreed to any movement aimed at deconstructing the democratic rule of law or the institutions that underpin it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro's son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, who is a senator, said on the social platform X that the indictment was \"empty\" and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. He accused the Prosecutor-General's Office of serving \"the nefarious interests of Lula.\"",
      "In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, \"contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial.",
      "The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. \"I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,\" Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia.",
      "\"Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,\" he added.",
      "As well as participating in a coup d'\u00e9tat, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office.",
      "Gonet said the criminal organization he charged \"had as leaders the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.\"",
      "\"Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,\" Gonet wrote in his report.",
      "The crimes have varying penalties. If Bolsonaro is convicted of attempting a coup and the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, according to the country's criminal code.",
      "The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office.",
      "The charges are \"historic,\" said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year.",
      "\"The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,\" Machado said. \"They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system.",
      "Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will \"position himself as a victim,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office.",

      "The 88-year-old pope has been\u00a0hospitalized since Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital after coming down with bronchitis the week before, and officials said he is suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection.\"",
      "Here's a look at the Pope's diagnosis and what his treatment could involve.",
      "What is bilateral pneumonia?",
      "Bilateral or double pneumonia is when you have pneumonia in both lungs.\u00a0Pneumonia\u00a0is an infection that inflames the air sacs of the lungs, which can lead to them filling with liquid. Symptoms include cough, fever, chills and trouble breathing.",
      "Pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening. It's most serious for infants and people older than 65 as well as people with heart problems or weakened immune systems.",
      "This development was a likely worry given the pope's medical condition.",
      "\"Even though we can treat pneumonias with antibiotics, pneumonias are also one of the leading causes of death,\" said Sauler of Yale University. He said antibiotics don't work in isolation and that a person's immune system is also critical to fighting off pneumonia, pointing out that the immune systems in older people aren't usually as resilient.",
      "\"When you're 88 years old, the age of the pope, then all of a sudden you have risk factors that make the situation tougher than just a routine pneumonia.\"",
      "What is a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "Essentially, it means there's a mix of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites growing in someone's lungs.",
      "\"Often times, people will get a bronchitis or an airway infection and that can often start a cascade of multiple problems, including infections in the lungs,\" said Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine at Yale University's School of Medicine. He said such issues were common in older people whose immune systems might be weaker or had complex health issues.",
      "\"It likely means he has more than one organism in his lungs,\" Sauler said, explaining that the pope's doctors might have to adjust his treatment to make sure the antibiotics attack all the various organisms.",
      "Pneumonia is a diagnosis of inflammation or fluid in the lungs, which can caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection. \"Bilateral\" pneumonia means the infection has developed in both lungs.",
      "How serious is polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "For someone with the pope's medical history \u2014 he lost part of his right lung decades ago and has previously had pneumonia \u2014 it's worrying that he's been hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Nick Hopkinson, medical director of Asthma + Lung UK, said most healthy people would likely recover quickly from bronchitis.",
      "But in people whose lungs are already damaged, \"bacteria can come and colonize the airways \u2026 and you start to see infections which makes it more difficult to treat.\" In people with lungs that have been previously compromised, they might need help breathing, including oxygen support or chest physiotherapy to help them clear fluids building up in their lungs.",
      "Still, Hopkinson said that getting the pope on the right medications should help.",
      "\"If they've identified particular things to treat, they can treat those and he'll start to recover.\"",
      "How long might this take?",
      "That depends. Antibiotic treatments typically take from a few days up to about two weeks. Hopkinson said the pope might be given various medicines, including ones that people typically take for asthma or conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to getting physiotherapy to help keep his chest as clear as possible.",
      "\"Some infections require prolonged treatment because they're just harder to clear from the system,\" Hopkinson said. \"It sounds like they've identified the bugs that are responsible and they'll be able to treat those\u2026but we'll just have to wait and see.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Openshaw, a lung expert at Imperial College London, said the presence of multiple organisms wasn't unusual in people with complex medical histories but could be hard to manage.",
      "What will doctors be monitoring next?",
      "Sauler said the biggest thing to watch out for in the coming days is any sign that the pope is getting worse.",
      "\"I'd be most interested in making sure he's not worsening despite the best efforts (of his doctors). That's usually a bad prognostic sign,\" he said, adding that they would likely review his condition in a few days to see whether or not the prescribed drugs are working.",
      "\"I have optimism and hope that he can pull through with the right antibiotic.\"",
      "What are the pope's other health issues?",
      "Pope Francis has been treated for a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries\u00a0and several previous\u00a0respiratory infections, including one that hospitalized him days before Holy Week in 2023. Knee trouble\u00a0led him to cut back on travel, and he often uses a wheelchair.",
      "He said in 2022, \"I think at my age and with these limitations, I have to save (my energy) to be able to serve the church, or on the contrary, think about the possibility of stepping aside.\"",
      "But in a rare\u00a0interview\u00a0with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2024, the pope described his health as \"fine\" and said he had no plans to leave the papacy.",
      "\"Maybe if the day comes when my health can go no further,\" Francis said. \"Perhaps because the only infirmity I have is in my knee, and that is getting much better. But it never occurred to me.\"",

    "summary": "Hamas says it will not only release more Israeli hostages than expected this week, but the terrorist group will also hand over the bodies of 4 slain captives.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo\u00a0\u2014 In a surprise announcement, a top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group would release six living Israeli hostages on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday, including the remains of the Bibas family, who for many Israelis have embodied the captives' plight in Gaza.",
      "Israel has said it is gravely concerned about Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, but has not confirmed their deaths. Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war.",
      "Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that triggered the war in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory.",
      "A video of the abduction on Oct. 7 showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men.",
      "Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, in prerecorded remarks on Tuesday, said the \"Bibas family\" would be included in the handover of four bodies. They will be the first hostage remains released by the group under the current ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.",
      "The six to be released on Saturday are the last of the 33 living hostages to be freed during the ceasefire's first phase, according to the terms of the agreement brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The group that represents the hostages' families in Israel welcomed the news Tuesday and named the six set to be released as Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu.",
      "The terms of the deal called for only three more hostages to be freed in this next exchange, and it was not immediately clear why Hamas had changed the plan.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said however that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza as part of efforts to accelerate the hostages' release.",
      "Hamas last week threatened to delay its ongoing releases of hostages, citing the refusal to allow in mobile homes and heavy equipment among other alleged Israeli violations of the truce, but an agreement was reached ahead of the Saturday handover, which went ahead without incident.",
      "An American-Israeli dual national, Sagui Dekel-Chen, was among the three hostages released on Feb. 15 \u2014 the second U.S. national freed by Hamas during this ceasefire after Keith Siegel was handed over earlier in the month.",
      "The hostages have been freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons \u2013 including some who were serving long sentences for serious crimes.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, enabled a surge of aid into the devastated Gaza Strip and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their homes, or what is left of them, as Israeli forces have withdrawn from much of the territory.",
      "The sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Major challenges are ahead. Israel's government says it wants to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza. But the terrorist group quickly reasserted its control over the territory during the ceasefire despite losing leaders and many fighters.",
      "In addition, President Trump's new proposal to relocate the Palestinians out of Gaza so the U.S. can redevelop the territory has been rejected by the Arab world and by the Palestinians, whom Mr. Trump \u00a0has said would not be allowed to return. But Israel has embraced the plan and, along with the Trump administration, has emphasized they share the same goals in the war.",
      "Israelis were horrified by the sight of three emaciated hostages in an earlier release this month, and revelations about hostages being held alone, barefoot or in chains have increased the pressure on Netanyahu's government to push ahead with the ceasefire's next stage.",

It is because of the continued harassment and targeting of innocent bystanders that Ms Lively\u2019s Amended Complaint does not refer to certain victim-witnesses by name, nor does it quote directly from their texts or include screen shots.

      "EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT MAHA",
      "\"When RFK came on the scene ... and started to give it a title, Make America Healthy Again just made sense,\" he said.",

      "For women in particular, Lake highlighted a few key issues the MAHA movement is likely to tackle.",
      "Pesticide exposure",
      "Exposure to glyphosate, an herbicide that is often sprayed on crops as a pesticide, could block the body\u2019s ability to fight off cancer, according to Lake.",
      "\"Not only does it strip minerals and key nutrients from our food, it also takes away key healing components that would prevent something like cancer from being formed,\" he noted.",
      "Glyphosate, which is sprayed on some crops as a pesticide, can have adverse health effects, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "\"One of the chemotherapy drugs they use to fight off cancer is in our food, but it's blocked by glyphosate.\"",

      "Fluoride in water",
      "While cancer impacts both men and women, fluoride in U.S. water sources could have a more severe effect on women\u2019s health, Lake suggested.",
      "Amid continued debate about the pros and cons of fluoride, new research has shown that ingesting the chemical can lead to lower IQs in children and can be harmful to the thyroid, which is a common issue among women.",
      "Fluoride in U.S. water sources could have a more severe effect on women\u2019s health, suggested one doctor (not pictured).\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"[Fluoride] reduces iodine in the human body because it competes for absorption, so now all of a sudden you have more of these thyroid problems,\" the doctor said.",
      "While thyroid medication is one of the most prescribed drugs in the world for women, Lake noted, \"it doesn\u2019t actually fix the problem.\"",
      "CHILDREN EXPOSED TO HIGHER FLUORIDE LEVELS FOUND TO HAVE LOWER IQS, STUDY REVEALS",
      "\"But if you look at things like fluoride and the deficiency of minerals in our food, and then you start to compound that with poor air quality, high stress, a lot of workload and family life and inability to make ends meet \u2026 it becomes a pretty big, noticeable problem,\" he said.",
      "Infertility and reproductive issues",
      "With high stress levels among American women, Lake predicted there will be a \"continuation of infertility\" without larger efforts to protect women\u2019s health.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the birth rate in America has dropped to a historic low, decreasing by 3% since 2022.",
      "One major concern among women is severe symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), Lake noted.",
      "The birth rate in America has hit a historic low, according to research, as reproductive challenges in women arise. (iStock)",
      "\"We've normalized severe PMS,\" he said. \"I think a lot of women have figured [that it\u2019s] pretty common \u2013 having menstrual cramping right before a cycle or having debilitating pain or the inability to feel energized leading up to a cycle \u2026 But that's not normal stuff.\"",
      "AMERICANS ARE HAVING FEWER BABIES AS BIRTH RATE HITS HISTORIC LOW, CDC REVEALS",

      "PCOS can be linked to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, causing a variety of symptoms.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "PCOS is also linked to chronic inflammation, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, which can then worsen insulin resistance.",
      "Food, environmental factors, sleep, high stress and deficiencies can lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, Lake noted \u2014 leading to an \"inability to detox properly so that your body is not getting rid of these things.\"",
      "\"It's my belief that God created our bodies to heal. Like He says, \u2018Our bodies are fearfully and wonderfully made.\u2019\"",
      "\"[Women] are exposed to the same foods and environmental challenges that men are, but they have these added components, specifically with their adrenal glands, that then affect their output of things like progesterone,\" he said \u2014 which is \"super important for hormonal balance.\"",
      "Unhealthy food choices",

Sawyer \u2014 renowned adolescent pediatrician, leader of the Centre for Adolescent Health at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, and chair of Adolescent Health at the University of Melbourne and the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital \u2014 spoke to me from Melbourne in a recent interview. (See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "She emphasized that the reason for the reported increase in anxiety is in part reflective of an increase in mental health literacy.",
      "Dr. Susan M. Sawyer, a renowned adolescent health expert and pediatrician based in Australia, discussed the first major study to follow anxiety and depression longitudinally in adolescents. It showed that worsening periods of anxiety or depression were associated with major milestones in kids' lives such as school graduations.\u00a0 (MCRI)",
      "\"These days there is greater mental health literacy, which leads to more reporting of symptoms,\" she said. \"And adolescents have a greater ability to recognize stress and emotional distress than we did and have the language for reporting it. The stigma is much less, which is healthy.\"",
      "Sawyer said she thinks the increased rates of anxiety and depression at ages 12 to 13 observed in the study were likely due to a combination of puberty along with the stress of changing to secondary education.",
      "\"Adolescence is a time for figuring out how to gain emotional control.\"",
      "Also, \"girls are more likely than boys to be exploring their emotions at this age,\" she said.",
      "SPIKE IN TEEN DEPRESSION ALIGNS WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, NEW POLL SUGGESTS: \u2018IT\u2019S NOT GOING ANYWHERE'",
      "The older group, called the second cluster, took place on graduation from secondary school; emotional symptoms were measured in such characteristic responses as \"afraid,\" \"woke up scared\" and \"afraid something bad would happen to me.\"",
      "\"Adolescence is a time for figuring out how to gain emotional control,\" said Sawyer. \"It is a time for seeking mental health support. The \u2018stiff upper lip\u2019 approach of [older] generations was not healthy.\"",
      "\"The more time spent on social media, the more lonely and the less connected [people are],\" said an adolescent health expert. \"We do need some system in place for delaying young people\u2019s access to social media.\" (iStock)",
      "Unfortunately, as Sawyer pointed out, the resources for intervention remain limited in Australia, the U.S., and around the world.",
      "The COVID pandemic clearly played a role in worsening anxiety among our teens; yet the CATS study, based in Melbourne \u2014 where there was one of the most severe pandemic lockdowns \u2014 found that it only contributed around 25% to reported anxiety and depression.",
      "The problem existed before the pandemic \u2014 and it is worse now.",
      "Concerns about social media",
      "So what role does social media play? The concern is great enough in Australia that it is instituting a social media ban for all those under age 16, which Sawyer and other experts say is not likely to work.",
      "SOLUTION TO \u2018VICIOUS CIRCLE\u2019 OF PARENT, TEEN ANXIOUSNESS IS \u2018KINDNESS': DR. MARC SIEGEL",
      "\"It is tough to implement,\" she said.",
      "\"And we still need more evidence, though it is clear that the more time spent on social media, the more lonely and the less connected [people are]. We do need some system in place for delaying young people\u2019s access to social media,\" she added.",
      "Further research into the role of social media is ongoing at MCRI in Australia. (iStock)",
      "\"And we do need to focus on the need for their development of independent skills, of standing on [their] own two feet without phones. Our children need a much safer place to be than social media.\"",
      "Further research into the role of social media is ongoing at MCRI. In the meantime, children are not allowed to have their phones out in schools throughout Australia.",

      "\"Social media is a two-edged sword,\" Dr. Sawyer said.",
      "\"On the one hand, a group that is more socially vulnerable and disconnected in a conflict situation can connect with like-minded peers and become connected via social media,\" she said.",
      "\"Prevention, through more attention to the physical environment, more nature, becoming less sedentary, rethinking opportunities, focusing on well-being \u2014 this is the real path forward.\" (iStock)",
      "\"But on the other hand, more time spent on distant communities is not good for young people\u2019s health. There is excess exposure to pornography, sexting, gambling and bullying. We need to do something to help our youth to disengage.\"",

      "Sawyer said the focus must be on prevention.",

      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection.

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The rise of cyberattacks on Apple devices",
      "Mac malware is not what it used to be. For years, the biggest threats were annoying adware and browser hijackers, more of a nuisance than a real danger. But that is changing fast. As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One of them,\u00a0Poseidon, launched in mid-2024 and quickly became the dominant Mac stealer, responsible for 70% of infections. It can drain over 160 different cryptocurrency wallets, steal passwords from browsers and password managers and even grab VPN credentials.",
      "At the same time, cybercriminals have doubled down on\u00a0malvertising, using fake ads on Google and Bing to trick users into downloading malware instead of real software. These campaigns are highly targeted, allowing attackers to pinpoint Mac users and serve fake downloads based on their searches. With AI now being used to create and execute many of these attacks, they are likely to increase in scale.",

      "Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords and two-factor authentication codes. Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'FOX & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cyberscams have reached alarming levels in the U.S., with nearly 30% of Americans falling victim to fraudulent schemes in the past year alone.",
      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",
      "With nearly 90% of Americans targeted by scam attempts and 40% receiving suspicious messages daily, the question remains: how can we protect ourselves and hold perpetrators accountable in an increasingly digital world?",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging. Survivors describe conditions akin to modern slavery, with physical abuse and even torture being common.",
      "Illustration of a scam on a computer key. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively. By learning from these international examples and adapting them to the American context, the U.S. could significantly strengthen its defenses against the rising tide of cyberscams.",

      "1. Verify before you act: Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you. Use official contact information to reach out directly and confirm the legitimacy of the request.",
      "2. Limit personal information sharing: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over the phone, email or online unless you are certain of the recipient's identity and legitimacy.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts:\u00a0A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms, and consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to store and generate complex passwords securely.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",
      "5. Keep your devices and software up to date:\u00a0By regularly installing the\u00a0latest updates and security patches, you can ensure your devices are equipped with the latest security features and bug fixes, reducing the risk of becoming a target for cyberattacks. Many cyberattacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates for your operating system, apps and antivirus software can significantly reduce your risk.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a service that specializes in removing your personal information from the internet to reduce your exposure to potential scammers.

      "7. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Promptly report any suspicious activity.",
      "8. Be skeptical of unsolicited requests: Treat unexpected requests for money or personal information with caution. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.",
      "9. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails or messages. Ensure your devices are protected with strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious activities. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

And he grew incensed over Ukraine\u2019s public complaints about being excluded from talks between the United States and Russia about ending the war after Zelenskyy met several times with some of Trump\u2019s top advisers.",
      "\u201cThere is frustration,\u201d a White House official said, accusing Zelenskyy and some other European leaders of trying to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Trump\u2019s peace efforts.",
      "This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and European officials and other people with knowledge of private meetings and discussions between and within the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal conversations.",
      "Trump lashed out Tuesday, blaming Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0decision to invade\u00a0and calling for new elections in Kyiv. After Zelenskyy countered that Trump is peddling Russian \u201cdisinformation,\u201d Trump\u00a0ramped up his rhetoric by calling Zelenskyy, the elected Ukrainian leader, a \u201cdictator\u201d who \u201chas done a terrible job.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, and elections scheduled for last year were suspended because of the war.",
      "The escalating back-and-forth has raised concerns in the United States, including among some of Trump\u2019s Republican allies.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis,\u00a0R-N.C., told NBC News the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy \u201cfeeds into Putin\u2019s hand.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s approach",
      "After Trump won the November election, Ukraine\u2019s Republican supporters in Congress and lobbyists hired by Kyiv in Washington advised Zelenskyy to demonstrate that his government was ready to compromise in peace talks and try to convince Trump that Russia was the main obstacle to any settlement, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "\u201cThe key was to convince Trump that Ukraine was not the problem,\u201d one of those people said.",
      "Putin has had little interest in negotiating a peace deal \u2014 and\u00a0intelligence from the United States and allies\u00a0indicates\u00a0that his views are unchanged\u00a0and that he eventually wants to control all of Ukraine. But\u00a0Zelenskyy\u2019s government recognized that Trump was skeptical of its cause and\u00a0that\u00a0he had a track record of avoiding criticism of Russia, two of the people with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Zelenskyy sought to show his government was flexible. With NATO membership a distant prospect, though the United States hadn\u2019t declared that publicly, Zelenskyy suggested, for instance, that European countries could deploy troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee in a postwar arrangement.",
      "His approach seemed to be working.",
      "Trump delivered some harsh rhetoric about Russia, threatening Moscow with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the United States and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war. He also tapped retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who has been sympathetic to Kyiv, as his Ukraine envoy.",
      "Then last week everything changed.",
      "Putin freed a U.S. teacher, Marc Fogel, who was imprisoned in Russia. The move allowed Trump to follow through with a promise he made during the campaign. Steve Witkoff,\u00a0his envoy to the Middle East, met with Putin for three hours while he was in Moscow to retrieve Fogel, Trump said.",
      "The next day, Feb. 12, Trump spoke with Putin, announcing afterward that the two countries would launch negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Afterward Trump spoke with Zelenskyy.",
      "In announcing\u00a0his\u00a0team that would negotiate with the Russians, Trump left out Kellogg, who was stung, according to a U.S. official familiar with his response. Kellogg is holding meetings in Kyiv but wasn\u2019t among the U.S. officials who met with the Russians in Saudi Arabia this week.",
      "Tensions in Munich",
      "As U.S. and European officials prepared to convene in Brussels and Munich\u00a0last week\u00a0\u2014 in meetings that would coincide with Trump\u2019s announcing his rapprochement with Putin \u2014 some Trump administration officials tried to keep the relationship between Washington and Kyiv from fracturing.",
      "Ahead of Hegseth\u2019s speech in Brussels on Feb. 12, some State Department officials advised his team that he shouldn\u2019t publicly say Ukraine won\u2019t gain membership in NATO\u00a0as part of a peace deal with Russia, according to four administration and congressional officials.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s speech didn\u2019t follow that advice. He departed from a draft prepared earlier in the day to deliver a blunter message about Ukraine\u2019s prospects for NATO membership than originally\u00a0written: \u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d he said.",
      "His prepared remarks had said security guarantees for Ukraine \u201cshould not be provided through NATO membership,\u201d according to three U.S. officials familiar with\u00a0them.",
      "Hegseth, who has said his comments about Ukraine\u2019s possible NATO membership were made in coordination with the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team,\u00a0tempered his comments the next day. He insisted \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in negotiations. And while Trump told reporters Thursday that he hadn\u2019t asked Hegseth to walk back his remarks, he also noted that Hegseth\u2019s tone had gotten \u201ca bit softer.\u201d",
      "At the same time,\u00a0Trump said he thought Hegseth\u2019s\u00a0initial remarks \u201cwere pretty accurate,\u201d further fueling confusion and criticism that the United States was ceding to a key Russian demand before negotiations had even begun.",
      "Privately, Hegseth stunned the Ukrainians when he told them at a meeting with Zelenskyy that the Trump administration is considering drawing down many U.S. forces in Europe as the United States focuses more on the Asia-Pacific region and its border with Mexico, according to five U.S. officials and another person familiar with the meeting.",
      "\u201cYour reporting is 100% false,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot\u00a0wrote by email in response to a request for comment about Hegseth\u2019s speech, the advice he received from State Department officials and his private remarks about reducing U.S. troops in Europe.",
      "\u201cAt no time was Secretary Hegseth advised by administration officials to avoid casting doubt on NATO membership \u2014 The secretary\u2019s remarks were coordinated with senior members of the president\u2019s national security team, and they supported the message he delivered top to bottom, full stop. In addition, the president himself reinforced Secretary Hegseth\u2019s remarks concerning NATO membership shortly thereafter in his own public comments in the Oval Office,\u201d Ullyot wrote.",
      "Ullyot also said Hegseth \u201cmade no announcement on, nor timeline for, a drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe.\u201d",
      "But Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance delivered a consistent message during their travels last week \u2014 that Europe needs to take more responsibility for its own defense as the Trump administration prioritizes the southern U.S. border and the Indo-Pacific.",
      "One security guarantee the United States is considering as part of a peace deal is to automatically grant Ukraine NATO membership if Russia violates the agreement, four\u00a0U.S. officials said.",
      "Such a provision would be aimed at addressing a key concern for Ukraine and its allies \u2014 that Russia would regroup and invade the country again, the four officials said.",
      "Other parts of Hegseth\u2019s Brussels speech, which he delivered with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sitting just three seats away, also made Kyiv nervous. He said it is \u201can unrealistic objective\u201d that Ukraine will return to its borders before Russia first invaded in 2014 and annexed Crimea, a declaration that was seen as a concession to Russia.",
      "The day of Hegseth\u2019s speech and Trump\u2019s phone calls with Putin and Zelenskyy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in Kyiv for a meeting with Zelenskyy that didn\u2019t go well for either side.",
      "Bessent presented Zelenskyy with a document that would give the United States ownership of half of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, which are critical to making a variety of technologies.\u00a0Zelenskyy was taken aback by Bessent\u2019s approach.",
      "When Zelenskyy said he needed time to study the proposal, Bessent told him he had an hour to sign it or risk having his upcoming meetings with Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio canceled, according to five U.S. officials and another person with knowledge of the discussion.",
      "The Ukrainians saw those meetings, scheduled\u00a0to happen later that\u00a0week on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, as critical for understanding Trump\u2019s strategy for peace talks.",
      "Bessent explained to Zelenskyy that an agreement with the Trump administration about rare earth minerals is a critical component of building a strategic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, which ultimately would contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv after a negotiated end to the war.",
      "The Treasury Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Zelenskyy didn\u2019t sign the document. In Munich, Ukrainian officials were initially told Zelenskyy\u2019s meetings with Vance and Rubio were postponed, according to U.S. and European officials and another person briefed on the discussions. They were delayed but ultimately took place.",
      "The rare earth minerals\u00a0agreement\u00a0remains in limbo.",
      "After having initially said the United States and Ukraine are still talking about the proposal, Zelenskyy signaled he won\u2019t agree to the current version because it wouldn\u2019t protect his country enough.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday in an interview with Fox News that he believes Zelenskyy will ultimately sign an agreement with the United States on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, saying it would deter future Russian aggression after the end of the war.",
      "The White House official said that \u201cthe Bessent offer is about acknowledging that Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself so far was largely contributed to by American taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat offer is about recouping some of that,\u201d the official said, \u201cand acknowledging that when there is peace, Ukraine has the potential to grow itself into a stronger economic position, through a partnership with the U.S.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:16:47 GMT",
    "summary": "A series of announcements by DOGE and claims by Musk and Trump about the agency\u2019s efforts have crumbled under scrutiny, even as they\u2019re repeated by the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s cost-cutting and fraud-finding apparatus, the Department of Government Efficiency, came out swinging in recent days.",
      "The result? Two stunning strikeouts.",
      "A series of announcements by DOGE as well as claims by Musk and President Donald Trump about the agency\u2019s efforts have crumbled under scrutiny even as they\u2019re broadly repeated by conservative pundits, sympathetic media and the White House.",
      "Two of the most notable claims \u2014 around Social Security fraud and $8 billion savings found in a Department of Homeland Security contract \u2014 have been debunked. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s agenda is set to add to the federal government\u2019s deficit well in excess of what DOGE is cutting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amateur hour in their federal government,\u201d said Martin O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor who ran the Social Security Administration under President Joe Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s unelected people that are being given powers to go through and rummage through our personal data for reasons that nobody can quite figure out yet. It\u2019s not for efficiency.\u201d",
      "Cutting government waste and hunting for fraud are perennially popular topics for politicians across the political spectrum. Federal agencies each have their own internal watchdogs \u2014 known as inspectors general \u2014 meant to hunt for misuse of taxpayer dollars. More than a dozen of them have been fired by the Trump administration.",
      "In their place, DOGE has worked to make sweeping cuts, most of which appear to be focused more on Trump\u2019s politics than anything else, and many of which experts warn could have unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who oversaw an eight-year effort to cut government spending and waste under President Bill Clinton.",
      "These cuts are \u201cgoing to blow up in their face,\u201d she said, warning that fired staffers could undermine the United States\u2019 ability to handle a crisis in national security, food safety, pandemics or aviation.",
      "While sweeping cuts in the private sector \u2014 and particularly Silicon Valley \u2014 may be celebrated, government services can be life and death, she said.",
      "\u201cYou take down Medicare payment system, you take down Social Security checks, you take down food inspections, OK? That kills people,\u201d she said.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE\u2019s cuts, as illustrated through the \u201creceipts\u201d posted online Monday, run the gamut across the U.S. government, albeit they appear to hew particularly to Trump\u2019s politics \u2014 particularly opposition to diversity initiatives and media outlets. The more than 1,000 listed cuts represent a fraction of the $55 billion in savings DOGE says it has achieved in about a month of work, according to its website.",
      "The list includes a hodgepodge of canceled media subscriptions, contracts and leases, and quite a few noticeable errors. One line item in DOGE\u2019s receipts claimed $8 billion savings found in a Department of Homeland Security contract, when the contract was for $8 million. The receipts seemed to undermine DOGE\u2019s own rhetoric, too. One of the DOGE wins from earlier in the month \u2014 a $57,000 contract in Sri Lanka focused on climate change mitigation that DOGE canceled \u2014 saves taxpayers nothing, the receipts note.",
      "The bulk of the savings listed in the receipts was due to the closure of the United States Agency for International Development, which is embroiled in litigation over the legality of its closure. USAID accounted for about 1.2% of the overall U.S. budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether or not it\u2019s legal to make some of these actions,\u201d said Josh Sewell, director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group advocating against government waste.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his team will make mistakes and correct them.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s going to bat a thousand,\u201d he said during a White House news conference this month. \u201cWe will make mistakes, but we\u2019ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.\u201d",
      "But his false claims have gotten enormous attention: A study from media watchdog NewsGuard published Tuesday found that 28 false claims accrued more than 825 million views in recent days.",
      "The White House announced Monday that DOGE would tackle Social Security fraud, shortly after Musk posted a spreadsheet of the ages of people in a Social Security database with millions of them over 100 years old.",
      "\u201cThere are FAR more \u2018eligible\u2019 social security numbers than there are citizens in the USA,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThis might be the biggest fraud in history.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not; it\u2019s a known problem with the government\u2019s data. There are millions of people over the age of 100 in the Social Security Administration\u2019s database, but the vast majority aren\u2019t receiving benefits. The issue has been repeatedly identified by inspectors general at the agency, but the Social Security Administration has argued that updating old records was costly and unnecessary.",
      "Per the agency\u2019s online records, just 89,106 people \u2014 not tens of millions \u2014 over the age of 99 received retirement benefits in December 2024, out of the more than 70 million people who receive benefits each year.",
      "It\u2019s a \u201chumiliating mistake for anyone else to make, but they\u2019re doubling and tripling down on it,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that addresses government spending. \u201cThat is scary, because they also have the keys to the kingdom, with all the access to this data.\u201d",
      "Concerns about access led the top acting executive at the Social Security Administration, Michelle King, to leave her job this weekend, after refusing to give DOGE access to the agency\u2019s sensitive data about Americans who receive Social Security.",
      "\u201cIf they act upon these falsehoods, that\u2019s really scary,\u201d Romig said. The Social Security Administration is careful about marking individuals as dead because the act triggers a chain of events that can cut people off from not just government benefits but their own bank accounts.",
      "She also warned that firing new employees \u2014 the probationary-period employees DOGE has targeted \u2014 at the Social Security Administration undermines the future of the agency and makes it harder to sort out payment errors.",
      "O\u2019Malley agreed: \u201cThe biggest threat to Social Security is not these falsehoods. The biggest threat to Social Security is that they are going to crater the agency by driving 10,000 people out of it.\u201d",
      "And while experts disagree on the cuts, many agree DOGE has drawn the public into the spending debate.",
      "\u201cPeople may argue with some of the details, but taking this kind of action and doing it quickly and doing it in a way that is bringing attention to how the government operates is helpful,\u201d said Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste.",
      "But fundamentally, Sewell warned, DOGE won\u2019t reap the desired deficit reductions needed unless it changes course.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d to achieve the kind of trillion-dollar savings Musk has promised without cutting defense spending and entitlements, he said.",
      "\u201cThe gravity of our debt, which is $32 pushing $33 trillion in our annual spending, which is around $6 trillion, is so big and so hard to comprehend that you have to have all hands on deck. You have to look everywhere,\u201d Sewell continued. \u201cIf a political actor only finds savings in their opponent\u2019s backyard, that\u2019s not a recipe for success.\u201d"

      "\u201cI just want to say that I am sorry for the lies I told and the hurt I caused. I never intended for this account to become as big as it did, and once things started snowballing, I enjoyed the relationships I\u2019d built and didn\u2019t know how to put an end to it,\u201d the person behind the X account \u201cPatriarchy Hannah\u201d wrote.",
      "Just who is \u201cPatriarchy Hannah\u201d? It\u2019s still not entirely clear.",
      "The social media fracas started last week, after internet sleuth Ryan Duff published a lengthy thread on X that dove into the account\u2019s background, pointing out inconsistencies in claims the \u201cHannah\u201d character made over the past four years. He said he combed through property records and obituaries, in addition to using reverse image searches, to prove that \u201cHannah\u201d was not real. Duff did not immediately reply to a request for comment made via X.",
      "His search led him to an Arkansas-based woman who does not appear to have 14 children. It is also unclear whether she is married. Images of a property shared by \u201cHannah,\u201d which Duff traced on the real estate site Zillow, appear to be of a house in Louisiana.",
      "NBC News has not confirmed the identity of the person behind the account and was not immediately able to contact the person. A request for comment sent to the \u201cPatriarchy Hannah\u201d account did not receive a response.",
      "\u201cPatriarchy Hannah\u201d is one of many online accounts that have gained some measure of popularity in recent years for embracing what they consider to be traditional women\u2019s roles, with a heavy emphasis on childbearing and homemaking. The lifestyle has been embraced by some in conservative circles, while receiving criticism in more progressive feminist and left-leaning spaces.",
      "The popularity of some tradwife accounts has also brought greater scrutiny, with the well-worn social media dynamic that life in the real world may not be as rosy as it is portrayed online. Some people who once created tradwife content have become its most visible critics, and media profiles of tradwife personalities are almost always followed by heated debate.",
      "\u201cPatriarchy Hannah,\u201d who goes by the X handle @harmonizedgrace, was a relatively small figure in that world, having amassed about 27,000 followers. A Discord server, which was used by fans of the account and appeared to be run by the person running the Hannah account, has been removed. It is unclear why.",
      "The community around \u201cHannah,\u201d who joined X in 2021, according to the account page, continued to grow as the account pushed traditional beliefs and conservative ideals. The person running the account said the \u201cHannah\u201d account never generated significant income.",
      "The \u201cHannah\u201d account posted frequently about her purported children and her husband, \u201cTony,\u201d who does not appear to be a real person, according to Duff\u2019s research. The \u201cHannah\u201d character would describe how women should behave and how they should present themselves, including posting about how women \u201cact like having children is an excuse to gain weight and it\u2019s not.\u201d She also posted about how there is \u201cno space for fat people in the public eye.\u201d She also wrote that if people\u2019s husbands are not \u201ccapable of violence,\u201d then they \u201cdon\u2019t have a husband; you have a wife.\u201d",
      "The \u201cHannah\u201d account also shared the belief that husbands and wives should not have ideological differences.",
      "\u201cIf my husband tells me that something in the bible means something different than I thought, I just accept that he\u2019s right,\u201d one post reads.",
      "Despite the account\u2019s relatively small following (some tradwife personalities have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers), the revelation of its fallacy sent shock waves through conservative corners of social media, some of which had grown to trust and even confide in the \u201cHannah\u201d character. Many replied that the apology was not enough and that their trust had been breached.",
      "As part of the apology, the account said that the person running it will not return to X and that the person does not see a point in sorting through which accusations are accurate and which are incorrect.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that I am not who I presented [myself] to be. I\u2019m not going to be giving my reasons for why I started because I am not looking for sympathy here. It was wrong, and I humbly hope that you all can find it in your hearts to forgive me in the future,\u201d the person running the account posted.",
      "The post closed by asking that people on X stop \u201creaching out to my family\u201d and said the person\u2019s family is \u201caware of the situation but are very freaked out by people trying to make contact with them.\u201d"

    "summary": "Andrew Lester, the 86-year-old white man charged with shooting Black teenager Ralph Yarl has died just days after accepting a plea deal.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Lester, the 86-year-old white man who pleaded guilty Friday to shooting Black teenager Ralph Yarl in the head after Yarl mistakenly rang his doorbell, has died, prosecutors in Clay County, Missouri, said Wednesday.",
      "The prosecutors did not say how or when he died. He was facing up to seven years in jail after reaching a plea deal and was awaiting sentencing March 7.",
      "\"While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case,\" Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson said in a statement. \"Our thoughts remain with both families affected by this tragic incident as they continue their healing process.\"",
      "Yarl's family members said in a statement that Lester never apologized for what he did and that \"instead, he and his attorney used every legal maneuver possible to delay accountability.\"",
      "\"Now, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system,\" his family said, adding, \"Ralph Yarl survived, yet justice was never truly served. He has a lifetime ahead to carry the trauma of that night, while the man responsible escaped sentencing.\"",
      "Lester had pleaded guilty to one felony count of second-degree assault.",
      "Last week, after the plea agreement was reached, Yarl\u2019s mother, Cleo Nagbe,said she was frustrated that Lester\u2019s case had been  delayed for several months.",
      "\u201cWhy did we allow him to live in his house comfortably, do all the things that he desired to do?\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "The family also expressed frustration with the deal itself, saying it does not erase the trauma that they and Yarl endured, nor does it address perceived failures in the justice system, including racial bias.",
      "\u201cWhile this marks a step toward accountability, true justice requires consequences that reflect the severity of his actions \u2014 anything less would be a failure to recognize the harm,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cThis case has never been just about Ralph \u2014 it is about every child\u2019s right to exist without being seen as a threat.\u201d",
      "Thompson responded that the outcome \u201censures accountability for the defendant, provides closure to Mr. Yarl, and satisfies the need to achieve a just result in the case.\u201d",
      "Lester\u2019s trial had been scheduled to start Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri. He had pleaded not guilty to one felony count each of first-degree assault and armed criminal action.",
      "Before the plea deal was made, members of Yarl\u2019s family said they had little trust in the Clay County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office because they believe it had not worked aggressively enough for a conviction, said the family\u2019s spokesperson, Faith Spoonmore, Yarl\u2019s aunt.",
      "As an example, she said, Thompson did not argue in the charging documents that race was a factor in the shooting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that the prosecutor\u2019s office is on our side,\u201d Spoonmore said before the deal was announced.",
      "Thompson responded Friday, saying, \u201cWe understand their frustration, but throughout this process our office has maintained regular and respectful communication with Mr. Yarl\u2019s family. They were consulted during the process.\u201d",
      "Race was a component in the case, but there was no evidence of racial motivation, Thompson said, adding he explored all aspects of the case.",
      "Lester, who was initially charged with a felony count of first-degree assault and armed criminal action, shot Yarl with a handgun on April 13, 2023, when Yarl rang Lester\u2019s doorbell, mistaking it for the house where he was supposed to pick up his siblings.",
      "Lester fired multiple shots, grazing Yarl in the head and striking him in the arm. Lester immediately called police, telling them he fired his gun because he was scared.",
      "Yarl, 18, who is in his first semester of college at Texas A&M, declined to comment this week, He told NBC News last year in his first in-depth interview about how the shooting affected him that it had been \u201ca bumpy journey.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s something that goes on that reminds me of what happened ... I just have, like, such a negative wave of emotions, like anger, like disgust,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a mix of good and bad days. And I feel like the good days are when I\u2019m able to be around people that help me build myself up.\u201d"

      "No final decision has been made about the future of the Enduring Welcome program managed by the State Department\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts,\u00a0known as\u00a0CARE. But office staff members were instructed to prepare plans to wind down operations by the end of March, VanDiver and the two sources said.",

We cannot believe that President Trump is aware of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d VanDiver said.",
      "\u201cVeterans put their own credibility on the line to bring our Afghan allies home. We told them that America keeps its word. Now this administration is making liars out of all of us,\u201d he said.",

      "Louis Lago, a former Baltimore Fire Department battalion chief who worked in the same death-investigation unit as Montague, said he fears for his children and other firefighters.",
      "\"My concern is that the program is going to dissolve, and I have two sons in the job,\" said Lago, who worked in the unit from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"I do think this has huge benefit to the safety and well-being of the fire service.\"",
      "He said that view comes in part from the experience of using the agency's reports when he led dive operations. During a recovery mission, a safety diver was unable to locate a trapped diver. But a second safety diver found the trapped driver and rescued him. Using two safety divers instead of one was a method Lago learned from the program\u2019s reports, he said.",
      "Now, with just two of the five investigators still working, he and others familiar with the program say it might not survive.",
      "\"If they terminate enough people, they won\u2019t be able to function,\" said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, chief steward for American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840 in Cincinnati. \"They\u2019re just taking a hatchet to things. They\u2019re not being mindful at all about who\u2019s being affected.\"",
      "\"Programs like the Firefighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program are an investment in public safety,\" said Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. \"The lessons learned through line-of-duty death investigations help prevent future incidents and save American lives. We are hopeful and confident that the Trump administration will prioritize these critical programs \u2014 because when fire fighters are safer, so are the people we took an oath to protect.\"",
      "The death program was not the only firefighter-focused initiative affected by layoffs within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the last week. Federal workers who maintain the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer, which collects voluntarily provided information to track and combat cancer deaths among firefighters, were also let go, according to union officials.",
      "The registry was created by a measure that Trump signed into law in July 2018. It passed both chambers of Congress unanimously. Last summer, at the Republican National Convention, Trump led a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed during a failed attempt on Trump's life. Trump brought Comperatore's jacket to his inaugural rally last month, and he has often spoken in praise of first responders.",
      "The dissonance between Trump's praise of firefighters is part of the reason the firings have left fire-safety advocates, workers and employee unions scratching their heads.",
      "\"I certainly thought that would factor into some of the decisions that were made,\" Lago said. The termination notice he received from the government \u2014 which accused him of failing to do an adequate job \u2014 stung even though it was at odds with his stellar performance reviews, he added. NBC News did not view his reviews or Montague's.",
      "\"I couldn\u2019t understand where they could blatantly lie in an official document about a performance issue,\" he said."

      "A trio of civil rights organizations filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday charging that three of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders attacking diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility in the federal government violate their free speech rights and hinder their ability to help marginalized communities.",
      "Through Trump's orders barring references to transgender people or support of DEIA programs within the federal government, public funding for several nongovernment organizations, including the three plaintiffs, are at risk of being cut.",
      "As a result, the civil rights organizations \u2014 the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation Chicago \u2014 said in their lawsuit that they will be less able to help \"people of color, women, LGBTQ people, and/or people with disabilities overcome systemic barriers to access housing, education, employment, and healthcare stemming from discrimination, biases, and inequalities.\u201d",
      "Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund, which are representing the civil rights organizations, said in a separate statement that the \u201corders will severely limit the organizations\u2019 ability to provide critical social and health services.\u201d",
      "Two of the orders specified in the lawsuit are the \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d and the \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d which Trump signed on Jan. 20, his first day back in office.",
      "The third executive order cited in the lawsuit, \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\u201d was issued Jan. 21.",
      "The lawsuit names as defendants Trump and more than a dozen key members of his administration including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, and Health and Human Services\u00a0Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\u201cProtecting the civil rights and expanding opportunities for all Americans is a key priority of the Trump Administration, which is why he took decisive actions to terminate unlawful DEI preferences in the federal government,\" Harrison Fields, a White House principal deputy press secretary, told NBC News in a statement Wednesday. \"Every man and woman in this great country should have the opportunity to go as far as their hard work, individual initiative, and competence can take them. In America, grit, excellence, and perseverance are our strengths.\u201d",
      "Previously, Trump\u2019s executive orders have labeled DEIA programs to help marginalized groups as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and his supporters have tried to spin what critics have called attacks on the transgender community as attempts to protect cisgender women.",
      "\u201cWhile the President may have his viewpoint, as flawed and discriminatory as it may be, the First Amendment bars him from unduly imposing his viewpoint on federal contractors and grantees,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Also, Trump\u2019s executive orders \u201ccould prohibit Plaintiffs from engaging in any targeted effort to help a specific group of people facing unfair disadvantages.\"",
      "Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said in the press release announcing the lawsuit that targeting DEIA was \u201cdiscriminatory at best and an attempt at institutionalized economic oppression at its worst.\u201d",
      "Janai Nelson, who heads the Legal Defense Fund, agreed.",
      "\u201cThe three orders we are challenging today perpetuate false and longstanding stereotypes that Black people and other underrepresented groups lack skills, talent, and merit \u2014 willfully ignoring the discriminatory barriers that prevent a true meritocracy from flourishing,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The lawsuit also noted that the language in Trump\u2019s executive orders \u201care \u201cextraordinarily vague.\u201d",
      "In the press release announcing the lawsuit, Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund included testimonials from a Black man with HIV named Will, who was identified as an AIDS Foundation Chicago (AFC) program \u201cparticipant and caseworker for another organization.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, as I work in the HIV field,\" he said, \"I am deeply concerned about the threat these orders represent to AFC\u2019s ability to serve our communities if they can\u2019t even name the issues our people are facing.\u201d"

      "Thousands of federal workers fired over the past week by the Trump administration will likely be eligible for unemployment benefits, which the federal government is required to pay for, along with other federal assistance the workers may now be eligible to receive, like food stamps or Medicaid.",
      "State agencies will determine on a case-by-case basis whether an employee is eligible for unemployment. But generally, workers can receive unemployment benefits even when an employer claims they were fired for poor performance, as the Trump administration stated in letters obtained by NBC News that were sent to thousands of federal workers informing them of their termination.",
      "The Trump administration over the past week has been firing thousands of workers who had been on the job for less than two years. The mass terminations have affected nearly every federal agency, including those that provide essential public safety functions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration, which designs, builds and oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.",
      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who Trump has tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory commission that is targeting government agencies for massive layoffs, have indicated that more cuts to the federal workforce will be coming.",
      "The federal government covers unemployment for former federal employees",
      "While states administer unemployment claims, the federal government is responsible for paying the full amount for former federal employees, with the agencies they were fired from reimbursing states for the benefits paid, according to the Labor Department.",
      "How much the federal government must pay per person will vary depending on their salary and each state\u2019s rules, though the maximum benefit is typically around $400 a week for 26 weeks.",
      "That could add up to millions of dollars for the federal government. In the most recent round of firings, hundreds of thousands of probationary employees could be affected, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management, although the exact number of people who will be terminated was not immediately clear.",
      "Can the federal government deny applications for the benefits?",
      "The federal government, like any employer, can attempt to deny paying unemployment benefits even if a state determines the fired employee is eligible. But to deny the unemployment benefits, the employer would have to prove the employee committed misconduct or another action that wasn\u2019t in the employer\u2019s best interest, failed to show up for work or voluntarily left the job, according to the Labor Department.",
      "In a letters sent to fired federal employees in recent days terminating their employment, the administration didn\u2019t indicate the employees had committed any misconduct. In one letter obtained by NBC News, an employee was told they were being fired because \u201cthe Agency finds you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.\u201d",
      "In another letter sent by the Transportation Department, employees were told that \u201cbased on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Department of Transportation would be in the public interest.\u201d A person familiar with the situation said many of the employees who received that letter had received positive performance reviews. The person shared a document showing some of the \u201cexceptional\u201d reviews that supervisors had submitted.",
      "In Virginia, where around 8% of workers are employed by the federal government, eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and the state has put up a web page to assist federal workers with questions about their eligibility, said Kerri O\u2019Brien, a spokesperson for the Virginia Employment Commission.",
      "The state web page says that an employee may be disqualified for benefits if they quit their job without good cause or were fired for misconduct. It adds that the state will send a questionnaire to the employer, and the employee will have an opportunity to submit evidence supporting their claim before officials make a determination on benefits.",
      "Other federal benefits",
      "Unemployed federal workers may also be eligible for SNAP benefits, known as food stamps, from the federal government if their monthly household income and assets fall below a certain level. Each state has its own process for determining who is eligible for those benefits.",
      "The workers can also apply for Medicaid if their income falls below a certain threshold or for federally subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges."

      "Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order Wednesday dispatching National Guard members to New York state prisons where corrections officers are holding unauthorized strikes.",
      "The executive order, issued to guarantee \"public order and protection of public property\" at the facilities, also allows for corrections officers who are showing up to work to receive overtime pay and directs the state\u00a0corrections department to bring in an independent mediator to help resolve the strike.",
      "\"These disruptive and unsanctioned work stoppages by some correction officers must end as they are jeopardizing the safety of their colleagues, the prison population, and causing undue fear for the residents in the surrounding communities,\" Hochul said in a statement.",
      "More than 3,500 National Guard members reported for duty earlier Wednesday to assess the greater needs before issuing a larger deployment, the governor's office said in a news release announcing the action. The guard members will maintain general order in the prisons in addition to distributing meals and medication to the inmates, officials added.",
      "The officers' job action began Monday and has spread to at least a dozen prisons where they say staffing shortages and dangerous conditions are placing their safety at risk. Most recently, the Collins Correctional Facility in Erie County was locked down last week after employees said they were threatened and inmates barricaded themselves inside of dorms.",
      "The officers' union, the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, said the walkouts and demonstrations outside of facilities, including Collins, have been unsanctioned as leadership attempts to negotiate a resolution with the governor's office and the state\u00a0Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.",
      "The officers are asking for safer working conditions, including more stringent security checks of prison visitors, and have voiced frustration over insufficient staffing and a need for higher pay.",
      "\"My administration and I have been and will continue meeting with union leadership to resolve this situation immediately,\" Hochul said in a video address Wednesday. \"But if it is not resolved, I will send in the National Guard to secure the facilities in question. They've already been deployed and are ready to stabilize the situation.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, New York state filed for an injunction under a state labor law to halt the job action, the governor's office said, and a judge granted a temporary restraining order to cease the strikes.",
      "The union did not immediately respond to the governor's decision to deploy the National Guard and the conitnued actions by members. It previously said that \"staff chose to not enter for their work shifts as a result of their discontentment with current working conditions.\"",
      "Daniel Martuscello, the commissioner of the state corrections department, had asked corrections officers Tuesday to return to work amid negotiations.",
      "\"We will continue to develop strategies to reduce assaults and to bring more staff on board with NYSCOPBA, the recognized bargaining agency for correction officers and sergeants,\" Martuscello said in a statement.\u00a0\"There is always room for progress and for disagreements and we welcome continued dialogue with the union at the table.\u00a0At this time, I am urging all those on strike to end this job action.\"",
      "Hochul has previously deployed National Guard members in a show of authority.",
      "In March, hundreds were sent to New York City's subway system to help deter crime and protect commuters and transit workers.",
      "The calling up of National Guard members comes at a tense time between state leaders, who in recent years have closed prisons amid chronic staffing shortages, and workers who say recent laws that allow for the near elimination of punitive segregation hamstring their safety.",
      "But prisoner advocates say safety also remains an issue for inmates, as underscored by the fatal beating in December of Robert Brooks, a handcuffed prisoner who had been transferred to the Marcy Correctional Facility in Oneida County.",
      "The beating was caught on officers' bodycam videos.",
      "Brooks, 43, died as the result of compression of the neck and multiple blunt force injuries, according to an autopsy report shared by his family's lawyer.",
      "Seventeen employees, including corrections officers and nurses, were suspended without pay or have resigned. State corrections officials also announced institutional changes, including expanding its body camera policy. The officers' union condemned the beating as \"incomprehensible.\"",
      "A special prosecutor was assigned to the case to determine any criminal charges, and a possible indictment could be unsealed as soon as Thursday, according to reports.",
      "Jerome Wright, co-director of the HALT Solitary Campaign, which seeks to end solitary confinement in prisons and jails, described conditions within the state's facilities as \"a powder keg,\" with inmates complaining of treatment by staff, visiting restrictions and the use of restrictive housing.",
      "Attica Correctional Facility in Wyoming County was the scene of one of the nation's deadliest prison riots more than 50 years ago, with inmates rebelling against poor sanitary and living conditions.",
      "\"How many warnings will officials ignore before the powder keg explodes?\" Wright said in a statement.\u00a0\"No one wants the horrors and deaths of an Attica 2.0.\""

      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government had been escalating behind the scenes for the past week before\u00a0they fully\u00a0erupted into public view Wednesday.",
      "Privately, Ukrainian officials were alarmed after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was told his meetings with top Trump administration officials could be canceled if he didn\u2019t swiftly agree to certain demands. They worried about mixed messages, in public and private, from senior Trump advisers about whether the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s joining NATO would be on the table in negotiations with Russia to end the war. And they were concerned when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told them in a closed-door meeting that the United States may withdraw a significant number of its troops from Europe.",
      "From President Donald Trump\u2019s perspective, Zelenskyy was showing resistance to what\u00a0Trump\u00a0views as reasonable asks of a country the United States has set up to receive more than $75 billion in military aid. He found Zelenskyy in no rush to\u00a0make some compromises\u00a0that U.S. and European officials have long conceded in private would be required\u00a0in a peace deal. And he grew incensed over Ukraine\u2019s public complaints about being excluded from talks between the United States and Russia about ending the war after Zelenskyy met several times with some of Trump\u2019s top advisers.",
      "\u201cThere is frustration,\u201d a White House official said, accusing Zelenskyy and some other European leaders of trying to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Trump\u2019s peace efforts.",
      "This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and European officials and other people with knowledge of private meetings and discussions between and within the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal conversations.",
      "Trump lashed out Tuesday, blaming Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0decision to invade\u00a0and calling for new elections in Kyiv. After Zelenskyy countered that Trump is peddling Russian \u201cdisinformation,\u201d Trump\u00a0ramped up his rhetoric by calling Zelenskyy, the elected Ukrainian leader, a \u201cdictator\u201d who \u201chas done a terrible job.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, and elections scheduled for last year were suspended because of the war.",
      "The escalating back-and-forth has raised concerns in the United States, including among some of Trump\u2019s Republican allies.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis,\u00a0R-N.C., told NBC News the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy \u201cfeeds into Putin\u2019s hand.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s approach",
      "After Trump won the November election, Ukraine\u2019s Republican supporters in Congress and lobbyists hired by Kyiv in Washington advised Zelenskyy to demonstrate that his government was ready to compromise in peace talks and try to convince Trump that Russia was the main obstacle to any settlement, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "\u201cThe key was to convince Trump that Ukraine was not the problem,\u201d one of those people said.",
      "Putin has had little interest in negotiating a peace deal \u2014 and\u00a0intelligence from the United States and allies\u00a0indicates\u00a0that his views are unchanged\u00a0and that he eventually wants to control all of Ukraine. But\u00a0Zelenskyy\u2019s government recognized that Trump was skeptical of its cause and\u00a0that\u00a0he had a track record of avoiding criticism of Russia, two of the people with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Zelenskyy sought to show his government was flexible. With NATO membership a distant prospect, though the United States hadn\u2019t declared that publicly, Zelenskyy suggested, for instance, that European countries could deploy troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee in a postwar arrangement.",
      "His approach seemed to be working.",
      "Trump delivered some harsh rhetoric about Russia, threatening Moscow with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the United States and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war. He also tapped retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who has been sympathetic to Kyiv, as his Ukraine envoy.",
      "Then last week everything changed.",
      "Putin freed a U.S. teacher, Marc Fogel, who was imprisoned in Russia. The move allowed Trump to follow through with a promise he made during the campaign. Steve Witkoff,\u00a0his envoy to the Middle East, met with Putin for three hours while he was in Moscow to retrieve Fogel, Trump said.",
      "The next day, Feb. 12, Trump spoke with Putin, announcing afterward that the two countries would launch negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Afterward Trump spoke with Zelenskyy.",
      "In announcing\u00a0his\u00a0team that would negotiate with the Russians, Trump left out Kellogg, who was stung, according to a U.S. official familiar with his response. Kellogg is holding meetings in Kyiv but wasn\u2019t among the U.S. officials who met with the Russians in Saudi Arabia this week.",
      "Tensions in Munich",
      "As U.S. and European officials prepared to convene in Brussels and Munich\u00a0last week\u00a0\u2014 in meetings that would coincide with Trump\u2019s announcing his rapprochement with Putin \u2014 some Trump administration officials tried to keep the relationship between Washington and Kyiv from fracturing.",
      "Ahead of Hegseth\u2019s speech in Brussels on Feb. 12, some State Department officials advised his team that he shouldn\u2019t publicly say Ukraine won\u2019t gain membership in NATO\u00a0as part of a peace deal with Russia, according to four administration and congressional officials.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s speech didn\u2019t follow that advice. He departed from a draft prepared earlier in the day to deliver a blunter message about Ukraine\u2019s prospects for NATO membership than originally\u00a0written: \u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d he said.",
      "His prepared remarks had said security guarantees for Ukraine \u201cshould not be provided through NATO membership,\u201d according to three U.S. officials familiar with\u00a0them.",
      "Hegseth, who has said his comments about Ukraine\u2019s possible NATO membership were made in coordination with the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team,\u00a0tempered his comments the next day. He insisted \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in negotiations. And while Trump told reporters Thursday that he hadn\u2019t asked Hegseth to walk back his remarks, he also noted that Hegseth\u2019s tone had gotten \u201ca bit softer.\u201d",
      "At the same time,\u00a0Trump said he thought Hegseth\u2019s\u00a0initial remarks \u201cwere pretty accurate,\u201d further fueling confusion and criticism that the United States was ceding to a key Russian demand before negotiations had even begun.",
      "Privately, Hegseth stunned the Ukrainians when he told them at a meeting with Zelenskyy that the Trump administration is considering drawing down many U.S. forces in Europe as the United States focuses more on the Asia-Pacific region and its border with Mexico, according to five U.S. officials and another person familiar with the meeting.",
      "\u201cYour reporting is 100% false,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot\u00a0wrote by email in response to a request for comment about Hegseth\u2019s speech, the advice he received from State Department officials and his private remarks about reducing U.S. troops in Europe.",
      "\u201cAt no time was Secretary Hegseth advised by administration officials to avoid casting doubt on NATO membership \u2014 The secretary\u2019s remarks were coordinated with senior members of the president\u2019s national security team, and they supported the message he delivered top to bottom, full stop. In addition, the president himself reinforced Secretary Hegseth\u2019s remarks concerning NATO membership shortly thereafter in his own public comments in the Oval Office,\u201d Ullyot wrote.",
      "Ullyot also said Hegseth \u201cmade no announcement on, nor timeline for, a drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe.\u201d",
      "But Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance delivered a consistent message during their travels last week \u2014 that Europe needs to take more responsibility for its own defense as the Trump administration prioritizes the southern U.S. border and the Indo-Pacific.",
      "One security guarantee the United States is considering as part of a peace deal is to automatically grant Ukraine NATO membership if Russia violates the agreement, four\u00a0U.S. officials said.",
      "Such a provision would be aimed at addressing a key concern for Ukraine and its allies \u2014 that Russia would regroup and invade the country again, the four officials said.",
      "Other parts of Hegseth\u2019s Brussels speech, which he delivered with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sitting just three seats away, also made Kyiv nervous. He said it is \u201can unrealistic objective\u201d that Ukraine will return to its borders before Russia first invaded in 2014 and annexed Crimea, a declaration that was seen as a concession to Russia.",
      "The day of Hegseth\u2019s speech and Trump\u2019s phone calls with Putin and Zelenskyy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in Kyiv for a meeting with Zelenskyy that didn\u2019t go well for either side.",
      "Bessent presented Zelenskyy with a document that would give the United States ownership of half of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, which are critical to making a variety of technologies.\u00a0Zelenskyy was taken aback by Bessent\u2019s approach.",
      "When Zelenskyy said he needed time to study the proposal, Bessent told him he had an hour to sign it or risk having his upcoming meetings with Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio canceled, according to five U.S. officials and another person with knowledge of the discussion.",
      "The Ukrainians saw those meetings, scheduled\u00a0to happen later that\u00a0week on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, as critical for understanding Trump\u2019s strategy for peace talks.",
      "Bessent explained to Zelenskyy that an agreement with the Trump administration about rare earth minerals is a critical component of building a strategic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, which ultimately would contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv after a negotiated end to the war.",
      "The Treasury Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Zelenskyy didn\u2019t sign the document. In Munich, Ukrainian officials were initially told Zelenskyy\u2019s meetings with Vance and Rubio were postponed, according to U.S. and European officials and another person briefed on the discussions. They were delayed but ultimately took place.",
      "The rare earth minerals\u00a0agreement\u00a0remains in limbo.",
      "After having initially said the United States and Ukraine are still talking about the proposal, Zelenskyy signaled he won\u2019t agree to the current version because it wouldn\u2019t protect his country enough.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday in an interview with Fox News that he believes Zelenskyy will ultimately sign an agreement with the United States on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, saying it would deter future Russian aggression after the end of the war.",
      "The White House official said that \u201cthe Bessent offer is about acknowledging that Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself so far was largely contributed to by American taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat offer is about recouping some of that,\u201d the official said, \u201cand acknowledging that when there is peace, Ukraine has the potential to grow itself into a stronger economic position, through a partnership with the U.S.\u201d"

    "summary": "The amount of any payments -- an idea that Trump said was still under consideration -- would depend on figures from DOGE, which has had some of its savings claims debunked.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump floated the idea Wednesday of returning some of the savings recouped by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to U.S. citizens, with an equal amount going to pay down the federal debt.",
      "\"There's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the DOGE savings to American citizens, and 20% goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are incredible,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump made the remarks at an event in Miami Beach, Florida, a day after Musk indicated on X that he would ask Trump about a \u201cDOGE dividend,\u201d described as a tax refund check sourced from the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle parts of the federal government.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Musk was at the event, seated near White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump appeared to confirm to reporters aboard Air Force One that the idea for the \"20% dividend\" came from Musk.",
      "\"I love it,\" Trump said Wednesday night when he was asked about the proposal, which a reporter characterized as Musk's proposal. \"A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste, fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening. I think it's a great idea.\"",
      "Trump suggested in his remarks earlier in the evening that the proposal to disburse DOGE savings to American citizens could give people incentives to report \u201cwaste\u201d on their own.",
      "\u201cBy doing this, Americans will tell us where there is waste. They\u2019ll be reporting it themselves. They participate in the process of saving money,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump did not provide any details about how such a plan would come to fruition or what the other 60% of DOGE savings would be used for.",
      "A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It is unclear exactly how much DOGE has eliminated or recouped, despite persistent vows for transparency, particularly by Musk.",
      "DOGE says on its website that it has saved $55 billion, pointing to drastic cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "But some of Musk\u2019s claims about DOGE\u2019s work have not held up under scrutiny. On Monday, DOGE said it recouped $8 billion worth of savings from a canceled contract at the Department of Homeland Security. A closer analysis revealed the figure was $8 million.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his team will make mistakes.",
      "\u201cWe will make mistakes, but we\u2019ll act quickly to correct any mistakes,\" he said at a White House news conference this month.",
      "Musk initially said DOGE would find $2 trillion in savings, but he backed off that figure last month."

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

The activist and author is bringing her story to a new generation with \"Ruby Bridges: A Talk with My Teacher.\"",
      "Henry created a sanctuary for Bridges while white protesters outside the building railed against the school being desegregated. Bridges, who was 6 years old at the time, had to be walked into the building by federal marshals amid shouting and threats from white protesters.",

      "\"I would not have gotten through that if it had not been for my teacher,\" Bridges said. \"And as you know, teachers really quit their jobs back then because they didn't want to teach Black kids. This one teacher came from Boston to teach me. She was amazing.\"",
      "Bridges said she was not allowed to go out for recess or eat her lunch in the school cafeteria, which led to her hiding her lunch in Henry's classroom.",
      "\"Like any 6-year-old, you want friends,\" Bridges said. \"And I remembered what kindergarten was like, that all of the kids met in the cafeteria, so I thought I\u2019m never going to make friends if I don\u2019t get to the cafeteria.",
      "\"That prompted me to hide my sandwiches, until the mice got really bad. And she found the sandwiches, and I was in a world of trouble.\"",
      "Bridges, 70, realized how important the bond was with Henry when she matriculated to the second grade in the 1961-62 school year.",
      "\"I have to say that second grade was much worse for me than first because she was my best friend,\" Bridges said. \"I didn't have any friends, and I had gotten so close to her.",

      "Bridges' story of integration was one of many from the civil rights era, but it has particularly endured. The scene of a tiny first grader being escorted to school by federal marshals also lives on in the form of the iconic Norman Rockwell painting, \"The Problem We All Live With.\"",
      "\"It's that one lone child,\" Bridges said. \"That innocence that we all see when we see that painting. How could that have happened to a 6-year-old? Innocence. And I think that affects each and every one of us when we see it, still to this very day.\"",
      "She also believes the moment can continue to deliver a strong message to the children of today.",

      "Now that the two have revealed their engagement news, fans want to know all about the cowboy who\u2019s been by Wilson\u2019s side and inspiring some of her sweetest songs.",
      "Read on to learn more about the honey in \u201cHang Tight Honey.\u201d",
      "He played football at Samford University",
      "Long before Hodges fell in love with Wilson, he fell hard for his favorite sport \u2014 football.",
      "The Kimberly, Alabama-born athlete discovered his fondness for the game back in elementary school and continued playing the sport through college.",
      "At Samford University, he was a starter for the Bulldogs and showed major potential. In 2018, his standout offensive plays earned him the coveted Walter Payton Award.",
      "He played for the Pittsburgh Steelers",
      "Hodges went pro in 2019. An undrafted free agent, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers and stepped in as quarterback for Mason Rudolph when he suffered an injury.",
      "Hodges remained with the Steelers until the following season. In 2021, he signed a reserve contract with the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "These days, he\u2019s a \u2018cheerleader\u2019",
      "Hodges left the NFL later that same year, then spent some time with the Canadian Football League\u2019s Ottawa Redblacks. In 2022, he retired from professional football altogether. Now, he\u2019s a cheerleader \u2014 of sorts.",
      "While Hodges officially works in real estate now, according to Wilson, he\u2019s so happy about her success in the country music spotlight, he\u2019s genuinely content to cheer her on from the sidelines.",
      "\u201cThankfully, I have found a man that is so happy that he\u2019s with a lady that can do her own thing,\u201d she said in a 2024 interview with Billboard. \u201cHe\u2019s just my cheerleader. He makes it real easy and it\u2019s fun to be able to share this part of my life that I\u2019ve kept ... close to my chest, I guess you could say, for a while.\u201d",
      "He goes by \u2018Duck\u2019",
      "Anyone who\u2019s ever heard Wilson speak about her main man knows she refers to him exclusively by his nickname, Duck, as do many others close to him.\u00a0But why?",
      "The obvious answer might be that he earned the moniker as a result of his love of duck hunting and competitive prowess when it comes to duck calling.",
      "According to a profile published on the Mossy Oak website, Hodges has had a passion for waterfowling since childhood, learning to hunt with his father and brother. At the age of 13, Hodges won the 2009 Junior World Duck Calling Contest, followed by a win at the Alabama State Duck Calling Championship in 2018.",
      "According to Wilson, though, there\u2019s more to the nickname\u2019s story.",
      "\u201cIf you read something online, it probably ain\u2019t right,\u201d she said of Hodges\u2019 nickname during a 2023 visit to \u201cThe Bobby Bones Show.\u201d \u201cHis college football coach was like, \u2018You\u2019re one of the best quarterbacks I\u2019ve ever worked with. And you remind me a lot of one of my favorite quarterbacks I got to work with years ago, and we called him Duck.\u2019 And so, him and the team just kind of started calling him Duck.\u201d",
      "He proposed with a multi-diamond ring",
      "On Feb. 12, 2025, Wilson revealed that she and Hodges were engaged by sharing photos and a video clip on Instagram.",
      "\u201c4x4xU forever \u2764\ufe0f,\u201d she wrote in the caption, referencing her loved-up single of the same name.",
      "Though Wilson didn\u2019t reveal how Hodges proposed, she did show off the spectacular multi-diamond ring he proposed with. In the video clip, she even walks with a limp, harking back to a comment she made last fall.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what shape it is, but I want to be walking with a limp,\u201d she said of her future ring on the \u201cCountry Heat Weekly\u201d podcast.",
      "Even if Hodges hadn\u2019t popped the question when he did, the couple might be engaged by now anyway. Wilson noted to Bunnie XO in a New Year\u2019s Eve chat for CMT posted to Instagram she was prepared to step up and ask him.",
      "\u201cI might have to propose to him,\u201d Wilson said with a laugh after her pal expressed hope for some engagement news soon. \u201cWe waitin\u2019!\u201d",
      "Months before, Wilson joked about the topic to Taste of Country, saying, \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to propose to his ass, \u2019cause he ain\u2019t proposed to me.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s the inspiration for some of her songs",
      "Those pre-proposal comments weren\u2019t the only hints Wilson was ready to lock things down with Hodges. The biggest hint of all might just be her 2024 song \u201cCounting Chickens.\u201d",
      "The track, from her fifth studio album, \u201cWhirlwind,\u201d is all about being ready for a proposal (and a wedding, home and family, too), featuring the lyrics, \u201cOh, and I ain\u2019t tryin\u2019 to scare ya/ Make you high tail fly the coop/ But I\u2019m counting on ya, baby/ Hope you\u2019re counting on me too.\u201d",
      "The song ends with a hat tip to who she\u2019s counting on: \u201cOne chicken, two chickens, three chickens/ Oh, shoot, I think that\u2019s a duck.\u201d",
      "According to Wilson, she\u2019s penned other songs about Hodges, too, though many of those aren\u2019t for fans\u2019 ears.",
      "During her chat with Taste of Country, she explained that she sings all her songs for Hodges before anyone else, including the ones \u201cI\u2019ve written for him that nobody else will hear.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s frequently her plus-one",
      "When Wilson opened up about Hodges to Billboard, she mentioned that he \u201ccan\u2019t sing a lick.\u201d But even though he\u2019s no country crooner, he\u2019s found himself at several music-award ceremonies.",
      "Since going public with their relationship, Hodges has become a fixture at many of country music\u2019s biggest events as Wilson\u2019s date."

It\u2019s all-important that security guarantees remain on the table\u2014and that they work for Ukraine, for real and lasting peace.\" The two appeared on the same panel at the Munich Security Conference last week.",
      "Zelenskyy, who was a popular actor and comedian before running for president, earlier referred to U.S. support given to Ukraine so far \u2014 $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion. He added that American demands that Ukraine should hand over more than $500 billion in rare earth minerals was \u201cnot a serious conversation\u201d and added that he cannot sell his country.",
      "Zelenskyy's pugnacious comments about not wanting \u201canyone making decisions behind our backs\u201d came in response to Trump saying that Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Wednesday in an interview on Fox News that no one should criticize Trump for trying to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. \"What he said yesterday and today is, why hasn\u2019t President Zelenskyy tried to end this war for the betterment of his country? And we have to ask ourselves, is Ukraine\u2019s position improving or not on the battlefield?\" he said.",
      "Waltz also added that there has been \"bizarre pushback and escalation of rhetoric\" over the Trump administration's proposal to invest in Ukrainian infrastructure and rare minerals.",

      "Trump also wrote that \"MILLIONS have unnecessarily died\" in the war.",
      "It is not known how many have died since Russia and Ukraine do not release casualty numbers, but reliable estimates put the number of those killed at a fraction of 1 million.",
      "Trump echoed criticism from Putin, who has ruled Russia for all but four of the past 25 years via elections widely considered illegitimate but has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of Zelenskyy\u2019s continuing leadership.",
      "Ukraine last held a presidential election in 2019 and was due to have one last April, but Zelenskyy has said in the past that it is not possible for Ukrainians to go to the polls in wartime and that view is also backed up by the country\u2019s constitution.",

      "The U.S. president is \u201cthe first, and so far, apparently, the only Western leader who has publicly and loudly said that one of the root causes of the Ukrainian situation was the brazen path of the previous administration to draw Ukraine into NATO,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cNo Western leader has ever said this.\"",
      "\u201cThis is already a signal that he understands our position,\u201d Lavrov added, in a speech that covered the broader second Trump administration rather than the president\u2019s specific remarks Tuesday."

      "\u201cAll I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions, in a six-square-meter (65-square-foot) space. I got out, but they are still there,\u201d Ohad Ben Ami, a\u00a0hostage who was released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. He added that hostages don\u2019t count days while in captivity, they count minutes and seconds.",
      "Hamas is set to continue the gradual release of 33 hostages during the current phase of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "But the two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas would release more than 70 remaining hostages \u2014 around half of whom are believed to be dead \u2014 in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Netanyahu and the Trump administration have given conflicting signals over whether they want to continue the ceasefire or renew the war. Both they say are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, but those goals are widely seen as incompatible.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned in agreements with Hamas or other deals, while just eight have been rescued in military operations.",
      "The militant group, though weakened,\u00a0remains in full control of the territory. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million.",
      "Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations\u00a0have universally rejected the idea.",
      "Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented,\u00a0would likely violate international law.",
      "The proposal has meanwhile cast further doubt over the future of the ceasefire. Hamas may be unwilling to release the remaining captives \u2014 its only bargaining chips \u2014 it if believes Israel is going to resume the war with the goal of expelling the Palestinian population.",
      "Hamas official killed",
      "An Israeli drone strike targeted a car in Lebanon\u2019s southern port city of Sidon, the deepest strike since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel took effect in November.",
      "Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas\u2019 operations in Lebanon. Footage circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames. The strike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon\u2019s municipal sports stadium.",
      "The original withdrawal deadline was in late January, but under pressure from Israel, Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. It remains unclear whether Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal by Tuesday.",
      "Since the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it is targeting military sites containing missiles and combat equipment. Each side has accused the other of violating the truce."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 11:00:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Israel's security Cabinet was to meet Monday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire deal with Hamas, while Netanyahu voiced support for Trump's Gaza plan.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's security Cabinet was set to meet Monday to discuss the second phase of the government's ceasefire deal with Hamas, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his support for President Donald Trump's plan to take over the Gaza Strip.",
      "Following a call with Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu instructed Israel's negotiating team to depart for the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Monday to discuss the \"continuation of the implementation\" of the first stage of the deal that has brought a pause to deadly fighting in Gaza, the Israeli leader's office said in a statement Sunday.",
      "Netanyahu's office said the negotiating team would receive \"instructions for the continuation of negotiations on Phase B issues\" after the Israeli security Cabinet's discussion on the matter as it pushed back on reports suggesting Israel had dispatched the negotiating team under U.S. pressure.",
      "Branding those reports \"fake news,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement there had been \"no American pressure to send a delegation to negotiate Phase 2.\"",
      "Still, plans for further negotiations come after Netanyahu said Sunday following a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Israel and the Trump administration had formed a \"joint strategy\" to ensure that the \"gates of hell will open\" if Hamas does not eventually release all of the hostages who remain held captive in Gaza \u2014 a key requirement of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "He also said Israel was \"committed\" to Trump's widely condemned plan to take over Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the infrastructure destroyed during Israel's offensive in the enclave.",
      "That campaign began after around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, with 251 people taken hostage into Gaza in an assault that marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, though researchers estimate the death toll could be significantly higher. At least 60% of the territory\u2019s infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, has been destroyed, according to estimates from the United Nations.",
      "Hailing Trump's proposal to take over Gaza as a \"revolutionary vision,\" Netanyahu said the U.S. and Israel had also come up with a \"joint strategy\" to see it through and bring about a \"completely different Gaza.\"",
      "In a meeting Sunday with a U.S. Senate delegation led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz further said he believed Trump's plan for Gaza was \"the only one that can guarantee security for the residents of the south and the state of Israel, in light of the lessons learned from the events of Oct. 7.\"",
      "Hamas on Sunday accused Netanyahu of looking to \u201creturn to aggression\u201d in Gaza as it accused Israel of \u201chesitation in starting the second phase of negotiations.\u201d",
      "The militant group also accused Israeli forces of carrying out a bombing east of Rafah city in southern Gaza, which it said killed three police officers. Video captured by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in Gaza on Sunday appeared to show people mourning over their bodies after they were taken to the European Hospital in Khan Younis.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that troops had \u201coperated to distance several suspects who approached them\u201d and were perceived as posing a threat.",
      "It added that forces on Sunday had fired to distance \u201csuspicious vehicles\u201d that were advancing north from central Gaza along a route unauthorized for passage under the ceasefire agreement and that the trucks had not been inspected, which it said violated the terms of the truce.",
      "That came as concerns grew over the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said in a news release Sunday that Israel had issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler housing units that could significantly expand the population of the Efrat settlement in the territory.",
      "The organization warned that such a development would also risk further blocking the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war, building and expanding Jewish settlements there that are widely considered illegal by the international community, a charge Israel rejects.",
      "The West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem would form the internationally recognized future state Palestinians seek \u2014 and the expansion of settlements, as well as Trump's plan to take over Gaza, presents major obstacles to that effort.",
      "CORRECTION (Feb. 17, 2025, 11:55 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Peace Now issued its news release. It was Sunday, not Monday."

      "The Trump administration has told the office overseeing the resettlement of Afghans to the United States to draw up plans to shut down by April. The\u00a0move could strand more than 250,000 Afghans and their families who face persecution from the Taliban for their ties to America, according to a refugee advocate and two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "\u201cThis is a national disgrace, a betrayal of our Afghan allies, of the veterans who fought for them and of America\u2019s word,\u201d Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of U.S. veterans and advocacy groups, told NBC News.",
      "No final decision has been made about the future of the Enduring Welcome program managed by the State Department\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts,\u00a0known as\u00a0CARE. But office staff members were instructed to prepare plans to wind down operations by the end of March, VanDiver and the two sources said.",
      "The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0Reuters first reported the preparations.",
      "Created after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan in 2021,\u00a0CARE\u00a0oversees efforts across U.S. government agencies to evacuate at-risk Afghans, process them in third countries and resettle them in the U.S. under a program called \u201cEnduring Welcome.\u201d",
      "It also works to address the\u00a0challenges women and girls face\u00a0under the Taliban, who have\u00a0rolled back their rights and protections.",
      "Among the over 250,000 Afghans who could be stranded if the office is closed are 128,000 people in Afghanistan who worked for the United States and have applied for special immigrant visas along with their families, as well as several thousand Afghans who were fully vetted and are waiting in Albania, Qatar and other countries to travel to the United States, according to U.S.-based refugee advocates working with the Afghans.",
      "The Afghans potentially affected also include family members of 200 active-duty Afghan American U.S. service members, unaccompanied minors waiting to be reunited with their parents and relatives of Afghans already settled in the United States.",
      "The discussions around closing the State Department CARE office are separate from the\u00a0freeze on refugee resettlement\u00a0and\u00a0foreign aid\u00a0that President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0ordered on his first day back in office.",
      "Tahera Rezaei, an Afghan veterinarian who lives in Chicago after having worked with Americans in Afghanistan, said she has been trying to get her family members out and is shocked and confused that the flights may be shut down.",
      "\u201cI keep saying this has to be a mistake or an oversight. We were told that those who worked with USA would not be left behind,\u201d she said in a message to NBC News. \u201cWe all followed the rules, and I cannot believe this is actually happening.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI am worried about my family I tried so hard to bring\u00a0them here but now I\u2019m heartbroken.\u201d",
      "VanDiver said American military veterans will be devastated if their Afghan partners are left behind in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump brought up Afghanistan at every single debate. Does he know that his administration is now abandoning the very Afghan allies who fought\u00a0and shed\u00a0blood alongside those service members? We cannot believe that President Trump is aware of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d VanDiver said.",
      "\u201cVeterans put their own credibility on the line to bring our Afghan allies home. We told them that America keeps its word. Now this administration is making liars out of all of us,\u201d he said.",

      "Kim Staffieri, executive director of the Association of Wartime Allies, a nonprofit group that helps Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, said she hoped the Trump administration would preserve the resettlement effort, as it did in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cWe made promises. They stood by our troops. We\u00a0owe it\u00a0to them to bring them to a place of safety. And we hope the administration will continue processing their applications, as they did last time,\u201d she said.",
      "The Taliban has jailed, tortured or killed Afghans who fought or worked for the former U.S.-backed government,\u00a0according to the United Nations. The Taliban deny\u00a0that, saying they announced a \u201cgeneral amnesty\u201d for former government soldiers and officials when they returned to power.",

    "summary": "A majority of inmates in the Dominican Republic  languish in prison without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.",
    "story": [
      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic \u2014 They\u2019re known as \u201cfrog men,\u201d inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.",
      "Thousands of them are crammed into the country\u2019s severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.",
      "Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.",
      "\u201cPrisons have become no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Rodolfo Valent\u00edn Santos, director of the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Public Defense Office.",
      "Over 60% of the country\u2019s roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.",
      "But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "He noted that the country\u2019s Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an \u201cexceptional\u201d measure. There are six other measures that don\u2019t involve prison time, including bail, but Valent\u00edn said they are rarely used.",
      "\u2018We have a situation\u2019",
      "On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzm\u00e1n walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.",
      "The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.",
      "It is the country\u2019s oldest and most populated prison.",
      "\u201cYou have to watch out for your life,\u201d said Lugo, who with Guzm\u00e1n visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of them who are not doing well,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said of inmates there. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme poverty.\u201d",
      "They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone\u2019s SIM card be recharged.",
      "Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country\u2019s deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Hig\u00fcey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.",
      "After last year\u2019s fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country\u2019s more than 40 prisons.",
      "\u201cWe must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country\u2019s prisons,\u201d Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.",
      "Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country\u2019s western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from politicians or anyone else,\u201d said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.",
      "Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.",
      "Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria \u2014 he spent two years in solitary confinement there.",
      "\u2018On the brink of collapse\u2019",
      "In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country\u2019s other 19 prisons.",
      "But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Commission of Human Rights.",
      "\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2019s prison system is on the brink of collapse,\u201d the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.",
      "In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valent\u00edn, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.",
      "In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.",
      "\u201cThe level of overcrowding\u2026makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,\u201d the report read. \u201cIn the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.\u201d",
      "Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hern\u00e1ndez has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germ\u00e1n Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germ\u00e1n said she is not granting media interviews.",
      "Both Santana and Valent\u00edn said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.",
      "Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.",
      "Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.",
      "While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.",
      "The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge."

      "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Rwanda-backed rebels appeared to be heading toward a third major city in eastern Congo, residents said Tuesday, as international pressure rose over the M23\u2019s expansion in a mineral-rich region that is critical for global technology.",
      "The M23 rebels on Tuesday attacked all the main Congolese army positions on the road to Butembo, a city of 150,000 people, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating, said Auguste Kombi, a civil society leader in Kitsombiro, a town along the road.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid that the enemy will advance to Butembo,\u201d Kombi said.",
      "Butembo is about 130 miles north of Goma, the city of over 2 million people that the M23 rebels seized last month as about 3,000 people were killed.",
      "The advance on Butembo means the rebels are spanning out both north and south of Goma. The rebels this week seized another provincial capital to Goma\u2019s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones.",
      "Also Tuesday, the M23 captured the town of Kamanyola, about 15 miles south of Bukavu, after they overcame resistance from the Congolese army in the evening, said Steve Mubalama, a civil society representative in the town.",
      "Mubalama expressed fears that the M23 rebels would advance a further 45 miles to the south to take the strategic city of Uvira.",
      "The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo\u2019s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried because we\u2019re in danger of experiencing a situation similar to that in Goma, with the loss of human lives,\u201d said Kambale Nyuliro, a Kitsombiro civil servant. He told the AP that Lubero town, on the way to Butembo, was surrounded on three sides by M23 fighters but still under Congolese army control.",
      "\u201cSince the fighting began, the enemy has only advanced,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cThose who tried to flee across the\u00a0Nile\u00a0were shot at, drowning them,\u201d Emergency\u00a0Lawyers\u00a0said, in what it called \u201can intentional act of genocide.\u201d",
      "The RSF could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The war in Sudan has created what the U.N. has called the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, and both the RSF and army have been accused of extensive human rights violations. The United States has determined that the RSF has committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "The attacks came as the RSF assembled allied politicians and armed group leaders in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to sign a charter that would provide for a \u201cGovernment of Peace and Unity\u201d to govern the territories the force controls.",
      "The charter\u00a0could mark\u00a0a turning point in the war, cementing a split along battle lines even as the fight for control over some areas rages on.",
      "However, politician Fadlallah Burma Nasir, head of the Umma Party which is split over whether to participate, said that the signing of the charter was postponed until later in the week to allow for a fuller representation from rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu\u2019s SPLM-N.",
      "The SPLM-N is a large secular military faction that controls wide swaths of the famine-stricken South Kordofan and had not previously taken a firm position in the conflict between the army and the RSF.",
      "An alliance with the RSF \u2014 on the basis of self-described marginalized groups fighting against the powerful center represented by the army \u2014 could boost the paramilitary\u2019s territory and numbers.",
      "\u201cWe want to build a new state, that is different from the old Sudan, which was based on separation, discrimination, hatred, corruption, and so on,\u201d said al-Hilu.",
      "Government spokesman Khalid Aleisir told Reuters: \u201cAbdelaziz al-Hilu\u2019s group showed poor judgment when they joined (the RSF\u2019s) agenda, but we know there is external power being exerted,\u201d alluding to army accusations that the United Arab Emirates supports the RSF, which the UAE denies.",
      "\u201cIn all the areas these gangs are present, the population refuses completely for the militia to speak for them or to impose a \u2018New Sudan,\u2019\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "More than 150 false killer whales have washed up on the coast of the Australian island state of Tasmania, with none of them expected to survive, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The 157 whales were found Tuesday afternoon on a remote beach near Arthur River on Tasmania\u2019s northwest coast. By Wednesday afternoon, only 90 appeared to still be alive, The Associated Press reported, citing the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania.",
      "Officials said rescue efforts had been hindered by poor conditions and that similar weather was expected for at least the next two days.",
      "\u201cWe have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales, but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break,\u201d incident controller Shelley Graham said in a department statement. \u201cThe animals are continuously restranding.\u201d",
      "The remaining live whales are expected to be euthanized.",
      "\u201cThe longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering,\u201d marine biologist and deputy incident controller Kris Carlyon said in the statement. \u201cAll alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanizer is always a last resort.\u201d",
      "The animals resemble killer whales but are actually large members of the dolphin family. False killer whales can weigh up to 3,000 pounds and generally live in deep offshore waters in tropical and subtropical oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The reason for the beaching Tuesday is unclear. They were the first false killer whales since 1974 to become stranded in Tasmania, where beachings typically involve pilot whales.",
      "In 2022, about 200 of 230 pilot whales died after becoming stranded further down Tasmania's west coast in Macquarie Harbor.",
