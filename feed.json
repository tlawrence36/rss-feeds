      "Military historian Rick Atkinson, known for his Revolutionary War trilogy, is venturing into graphic books",
      "NEW YORK -- Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson, a comic book fan growing up, hadn't imagined his own work being suitable for the illustrated format.",
      "Ten Speed Graphic announced Tuesday that a graphic edition of \u201cThe British Are Coming,\u201d the first volume of Atkinson's acclaimed Revolutionary War trilogy, will be out next June, shortly before the country's 250th anniversary. Five more graphic books are planned, to be written by Nora Neus and illustrated by Federico Pietrobon, with Atkinson in close collaboration.",
      "\u201cThey are entirely amenable to my suggestions, \u2018This isn\u2019t quite right,\u2019 or \u2018I think this needs to be explained,\u2019\u201d Atkinson told The Associated Press. \u201cWith the drawings, I pointed out that John Adams, at the time the revolution began was a relatively young man. And they had made him look like the paunchy, bald John Adams of the vice presidency. And they fixed it.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his World War II book \u201cAn Army at Dawn,\u201d has been working on his revolutionary trilogy for a decade and published the second volume, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d this spring. Widely regarded as among the best living military historians, he was a featured commentator in Ken Burns' \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d documentary and has made numerous joint appearances with the filmmaker. He is currently working on the final book of his trilogy.",

      "The author says that he was initially skeptical about the new project.

But the graphic format has been used on everything from \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. Atkinson changed his mind after Ten Speed Graphic, a Penguin Random House imprint, sent him several adaptations, including of the life of Frederick Douglass and Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny.\u201d",

      "The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself",
      "NEW YORK -- The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself.",
      "Like so many Jamaican teens of his time, he moved to Kingston in the early 1960s and joined a rising musical movement that would help give voice to the country's independence from Great Britain. A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack. In the years following, his songs were covered by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to UB40 and confirmed the music's power to inspire or just get you dancing.",
      "Here are a few songs that trace the arc of his career, and of reggae.",
      "Singing along to an easy, bluesy groove, Cliff had a way of sounding both relaxed and fully committed, and could make a nursery rhyme sound like an anthem: \u201cRoses are red / violets are blue / Believe me / I love you.\u201d He also joined a long popular tradition, most famously expressed in such 1970s standards as Billy Joel's \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and Springsteen's \u201cThunder Road,\u201d of offering praise to a very personal kind of beauty: \u201cAlthough you may not have such a fabulous shape / To suit the rest of the world / But you do suit me and that\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d",
      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Onstage, he sometimes literally jumped for joy, but Cliff also could call out the deepest notes of despair. The somber, gospel-style \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d was inspired by the racism he encountered in England in the 1960s and tells a story of displacement, longing, fatigue and gathering rage \u2014 but never defeat. \u201cI merely survive because of my pride,\u201d he tells us, a variation of the old saying that hopes dies last.",
      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity.

      "His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood\u2019s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

Just a year after part one brought droves of audiences to movie theaters around the country, even more people bought opening weekend tickets to see the epic conclusion, \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d According to studio estimates on Sunday, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d earned $150 million from North American theaters in its first days in theaters and $226 million globally.",

      "\u201cThe results are just fantastic,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal. \u201cSome films can deliver a false positive when tickets go on sale early but these results speak for themselves.\"",

By Friday it was playing in 4,115 North American locations and had raked in $68.6 million. IMAX showings accounted for $15.5 million, or 11%, of its domestic haul \u2014 a November record for the company.",

Critics were somewhat mixed on the final chapter, but audiences weren\u2019t: An overwhelming 83% of audiences said it was one they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d to friends.

      "Jon M. Chu directed both \u201cWicked\u201d films, starring Cynthia Ervio and Ariana Grande. The first film made over $758.7 million worldwide and received 10 Oscar nominations (winning two, for costume and production design ). The question is how high \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d can soar. Combined, the two films cost around $300 million to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",

Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and honors last month as the royal family tried to insulate itself from criticism about his relationship with Epstein.",

      "Ornella Vanoni, a beloved Italian singer with a career spanning seven decades, has died at 91",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Ornella Vanoni, a beloved performer who had a seven decade-long singing career with such international hits as \u201cSenza Fine\u201d and \"L\u2019appuntamento,\u201d has died. She was 91.",
      "In a post on X Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her deep sorrow for the loss of Vanoni, whose \u201cunmistakable voice\u201d left an imprint on Italian culture for generations. \u201cItaly loses a unique artist who leaves us with an unrepeatable artistic heritage,\u201d Meloni said.",
      "Vanoni died of cardiac arrest at her Milan home, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.",
      "Vanoni recorded more than 100 albums with sales of over 55 million copies, vaulting her to iconic status among generations of fans and earning her the moniker \u201cThe Lady of Italian Song,\u201d according to LaPresse newspaper.",
      "Born in Milan in 1937, Vanoni's first love was the theater, which culminated with performances on the Broadway stage in 1964. But her passion for music combined with what LaPresse described as a \u201chighly personal and sophisticated performing style\u201d and vast repertoire from jazz to pop led her to collaborate with some of the most important songwriters in Italy and abroad.",
      "Vanoni's partnership \u2014 and love affair \u2014 with famed Genovese singer-songwriter Gino Paoli produced the hit \u201cSenza Fine\u201d (Without End), which shot her onto the international stage in 1961.",

      "Rosal\u00eda has won over millions of music lovers for her fusions of flamenco and urban Latin beats",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- And Rosal\u00eda said, \u201cLet there be Lux.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.",
      "The singer and songwriter\u2019s new album, \u201cLux\u201d (\u201cLight\u201d in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.",
      "And it is receiving praise from on high.",
      "Xabier G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, G\u00f3mez said that while some of her songs were \u201cprovocative,\u201d Rosal\u00eda \u201cspeaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I listened to \u2018Lux\u2019 and Rosal\u00eda speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,\u201d he said.",
      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

Contrast that now with her look on the \u201cLux\u201d album cover, where she is dressed in a solid white nun's veil with her arms apparently trapped inside a white top, her gaze averted.",
      "Despite the potentially controversial move of comparing God to an obsessed lover in the song \u201cDios es un stalker\" (\"God Is a Stalker\" in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda has won over the equivalent of the Vatican's culture minister.",

      "\u201cWhen a creator like Rosal\u00eda speaks of spirituality,\u201d he said, \u201cit means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.\u201d",
      "Among the songs about faith, Rosal\u00eda found the time to deliver tunes like \u201cLa Perla\" (\"The Pearl\" in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.",
      "That deft mix of both high and pop culture is part of the allure of \u201cLux,\u201d said Josep Oton, professor of religious history for the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona.",
      "\u201cShe has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,\u201d Oton told the AP. \u201cAnyone can listen to it, and people with different backgrounds can take away different things. It is pop music, but it is profound.\u201d",
      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

      "It's the second agreement between a major record label and Udio, a chatbot-style song generation tool.",

AI-generated music has been flooding streaming services amid the rise of song generators that instantly spit out new tunes based on prompts typed in by users without any musical knowledge. The synthetic music boom has also resulted in a wave of AI singers and bands that have climbed the charts after racking up millions of streams, even though they don't exist in real life.",
      "Warner, which represents artists including Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, has resolved its copyright infringement litigation against Udio, the two companies said. They've also established \u201da clear framework\" for developing Udio\u2019s licensed AI music creation service that's set to launch in 2026.",
      "They provided no financial details on their agreement, which includes Warner's recording and publishing businesses, but it will create \u201cnew revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.\"",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",

      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lidia Bastianich grew up in a small town in Italy where neighbors were like extended family. If kids came home from school and mom was out, they went to the neighbors for a snack. If someone had a problem with a sibling, they went next door.",

      "She's hoping to spotlight and cultivate togetherness with her 14th TV special, \u201cLidia Celebrates America: A Nation of Neighbors,\u201d which premieres Nov. 25 on PBS and streams on PBS.org.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my way of really thanking America. I think that there\u2019s no better place in the whole world than the United States of America and somehow it\u2019s been maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I know is that out there, in the midst of America, there\u2019s a lot of good American people.\u201d",
      "Bastianich travels to wildfire-scarred neighborhoods outside Los Angeles, a pay-how-you-can caf\u00e9 in Denver, a Japanese-American community center in Portland, Oregon, and a first-of-its-kind free grocery market in San Francisco. At every stop, there are hands reaching out to help.",
      "\u201cThat connection makes you feel good, it makes you feel more of a human being. And it gives you back that kind of desire to live on positively,\u201d she says.",
      "The hourlong special starts in Altadena, California, hurting from the recent wildfires. Bastianich joins volunteers making 175 five-course meals that are delivered to victims. One of the volunteers is someone himself living out of his car because the flames had made him homeless.",
      "\u201cI got the shivers. I just needed to hug him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI know that he needed that. I know he was in his car by himself, and yet he found it within him to give. That takes fortitude. It takes character.\"",

      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",

      "Experts have mixed reactions to the recent U.N. climate talks in the Amazon",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "With a runway of smoking-hot coals laid out before them, residents in San Pedro Manrique, Spain, steel themselves as thousands of onlookers cheer them on. The crowd roars when they walk across the fire, sometimes carrying another person on their back.",
      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "The message is hammered over and over, in news conferences, hearings and executive orders: President Donald Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., say they want the government to follow \u201cgold standard\u201d science.",
      "Scientists say the problem is that they are often doing just the opposite by relying on preliminary studies, fringe science or just hunches to make claims, cast doubt on proven treatments or even set policy.",
      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence. Speaking directly to pregnant women and to parents, he told them not to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. He repeatedly made the fraudulent and long-disproven link between autism and vaccines, saying his assessment was based on a hunch.",
      "\u201cI have always had very strong feelings about autism and how it happened and where it came from,\u201d he said.",
      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

      "After a disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements.",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about SNAP:",
      "For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown.",

      "A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don\u2019t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",

      "Authorities have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysa -- Authorities worldwide have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis that threatens the survival of one of the planet\u2019s most iconic species, according to research released Tuesday.",
      "A new report by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC warned that criminal networks are evolving faster than conservation efforts can respond. The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000 a century ago, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, it said.",
      "Despite half a century of international protection, TRAFFIC's findings showed that tiger trafficking is accelerating and increasingly targeting whole animals, living or dead. Experts say the shift appears linked to captive-breeding operations, but may also reflect tigers being seized shortly after poaching or before being dismembered for their parts. Additionally, it could be driven by a rise in exotic pet ownership or demand for taxidermy, they say.",
      "The report, the sixth in TRAFFIC\u2019s Skin and Bones series examining the illegal trade in tigers, highlights stark trends. Between 2000 and mid-2025, law enforcement agencies globally recorded 2,551 seizures involving at least 3,808 tigers.",
      "In the five years from 2020 to June 2025 alone, authorities made 765 seizures, confiscating the equivalent of 573 tigers, roughly nine a month over 66 months. The worst single year was 2019, when 141 seizures were recorded, followed by 139 in 2023.",
      "Most of the seizures occurred within the 13 countries which have wild tiger populations, led by India with the world's biggest tiger population, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Among countries without tigers, a sizable number of incidents were reported by Mexico, U.S. and the United Kingdom, the report said. While enforecement has strengthened, so has trade.",
      "\u201cThis rise reflects improved enforcement efforts but also signals persistent and, in some areas, escalating criminal activity and a widespread demand for tigers and their parts,\u201d said Ramacandra Wong, senior wildlife crime analyst and co-author of the report.",
      "TRAFFIC\u2019s latest analysis reveals a dramatic shift: In the 2000s, tiger parts accounted for 90% of seized products but since 2020 that proportion has dropped to 60%, replaced by a spike in seizures of whole animal carcasses and live tigers. More than 40% of confiscations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia now involve whole tigers.",

      "The report also documents growing \u201cspecies convergence\u201d with almost one in five tiger trafficking incidents involving other threatened wildlife \u2014 most commonly leopards, bears and pangolins.",
      "Patterns of consumption vary sharply by geography. In Mexico and the United States, demand trends toward live tigers, often for exotic pet ownership. Europe shows a stronger market for tiger derivatives used in certain traditional medicines and taxidermy for decoration. Across Asia, demand spans skins, bones, claws and whole dead animals for fashion and traditional medicine.",
      "The report said investigations should not end at the point of seizure. It said strong international cooperation is crucial, and that disruption of organized crime network along the illegal trade chain through intelligence-led, multi-agency enforcement is essential.",
      "Leigh Henry, director of wildlife conservation at the environmental charity WWF, told The Associated Press that the surge in whole-animal trafficking underscored the \u201cprominent role of captive tiger breeding facilities in feeding and perpetuating the illegal trade.\"",
      "\u201cIllegal trade remains the greatest immediate threat to wild tigers. If we don\u2019t urgently scale up investments to combat tiger trafficking \u2014 at all points along the trade chain \u2014 we absolutely face the possibility of a world without wild tigers,\u201d she said.",

      "In her announcement Monday ending temporary protection from deportation for citizens of Myanmar, also known as Burma, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited the military's plans for \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d in December and \u201csuccessful ceasefire agreements\u201d as among the reasons for her decision.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The military under Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing seized power from democratically-elected Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and is seeking to add a sheen of international legitimacy to its government with the upcoming elections. But with Suu Kyi in prison and her party banned, most outside observers have denounced the elections as a sham.",
      "\u201cHomeland Secretary Kristi Noem is treating those people just like her family\u2019s dog that she famously shot down in cold blood because it misbehaved \u2014 if her order is carried out, she will literally be sending them back to prisons, brutal torture, and death in Myanmar,\u201d Phil Robertson, the director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSecretary Noem is seriously deluded if she thinks the upcoming elections in Myanmar will be even remotely free and fair, and she is just making things up when she claims non-existent ceasefires proclaimed by Myanmar\u2019s military junta will result in political progress.\u201d",
      "The military takeover sparked a national uprising with fierce fighting in many parts of the country, and pro-democracy groups and other forces have taken over large swaths of territory.",
      "The military government has stepped up activity ahead of the election to retake areas controlled by opposition forces, with airstrikes killing scores of civilians.",
      "In its fight, the military has been accused of the indiscriminate use of landmines, the targeting of schools, hospitals and places of worship in its attacks, and the use of civilians as human shields.",

      "BEIRUT -- Mireille Khoury lit a candle next to a portrait of her late son, Elias, surrounded by images of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, just as she does every evening when she returns to her Beirut apartment after work.",
      "Elias was only 15 when he died in the August 2020 explosion at the Beirut port that blasted through surrounding neighborhoods in the Lebanese capital. Since then Khoury has been among the families who have convened monthly protests calling for justice for the 218 people killed when hundreds of tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate detonated.",
      "Their numbers have dwindled as the investigation has stalled and hopes of accountability have faded. But the upcoming visit of Pope Leo XIV to Lebanon has rekindled a glimmer of hope for Khoury and many others in the small, crisis-battered country.",
      "\u201cWe need a lot of prayers, and we need a miracle for this country to continue,\u201d said Khoury, who is set to join the pontiff in a silent prayer at the site of the port explosion on the last day of his visit to Lebanon.",
      "The visit set to begin on Sunday comes as part of Pope Leo's first official foreign trip and as the fulfillment of a promise made by his predecessor, Pope Francis, to visit Lebanon, a Muslim-majority country where about a third of the population is Christian. Leo will also visit Turkey.",
      "The fourth visit of a pope to Lebanon, it sends a powerful message of support at a time when regional instability and deepening internal crises have left the country in a precarious situation.",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by political unrest, the collapse of its currency and banking system, the port explosion and, most recently, a war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. The war decimated large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon, leaving more than 4,000 dead, including hundreds of civilians, and causing an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction.",
      "To many Lebanese, it feels like divine intervention is the only solution for their country.",
      "In the village of Dardghaya, a mixed community of Christians and Shiite Muslims in southern Lebanon, about a dozen worshippers gathered for Mass on a recent Sunday in a small basement room. Images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and St. George \u2014 the church\u2019s namesake \u2014 stared down from freshly painted white walls as a small girl swung an incense burner.",
      "Above them, the town\u2019s century-old Greek Melkite church was still in ruins after being hit by an Israeli strike during last year's Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "Despite a U.S. brokered ceasefire that took effect in November 2024, Israel has continued to carry out near-daily strikes in southern Lebanon \u2014 and, occasionally, in the suburbs of the capital \u2014 that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding. The precarious situation has dissuaded many former congregants from returning to Dardghaya.",
      "The church\u2019s priest, Father Maurice el Khoury, said he feels \u201ca great hope\" that Pope Leo's visit \"will bring about a radical change in Lebanon\u2019s trajectory.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that the pope\u2019s visit is only for the Christians,\u201d el Khoury said. \u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a blessing and salvation for all of Lebanon.\u201d",
      "Still, many in southern Lebanon were disappointed that the pontiff's itinerary did not include a visit to their war-battered areas, similar to Pope Francis' trip to the devastated city of Mosul when he visited Iraq in 2021.",
      "Georges Elia, a member of the Dardghaya congregation, said he will attend a meeting between the pontiff and youth groups at the Maronite Patriarchate in Bkerki, in northern Lebanon.",
      "But he is still holding out hope for a surprise papal visit to the south, a \u201csacred land, where Jesus Christ once walked,\" he said. \u201cThe south is bleeding, and it\u2019s in need of (the pope) to help us return and stand firm on our land.\"",

Police documents released this week identified the model as the Maverick PG22, a working revolver modeled on the brightly colored toy gun of the same name.",

      "\u201cThese processes are very straight forward processes and require minimal skills and common \u2018handyperson\u2019 tools,\u201d Millar wrote. He added that these tools were \u201ca battery drill and a drill bit for the holes and a small screw for the firing pin.\u201d",
      "New Zealand\u2019s police union said in February that the Maverick PG22 was among the most common 3D-printed guns seized by officers. Millar wrote that his team requested to keep one of the revolvers for testing, but the police commissioner denied the request and the guns were destroyed on Sept. 25.",
      "\u201cThe first risk is that it can be made viable and it gets into the hands of the wrong person and it\u2019s used for a crime,\u201d said professor Alexander Gillespie, a lecturer on firearms regulation at New Zealand\u2019s University of Waikato. \u201cThe second risk is it just explodes because it\u2019s not actually safe. There\u2019s a reason these have been made in people\u2019s backyards instead of coming from an armory.\u201d",
      "Online instructions for making the Maverick PG22 say it \u201cdoes not feature proper modern safeties and should be used in a controlled environment.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who manufactured Patel\u2019s guns, which Millar wrote had been \u201cmanufactured to a high standard.\u201d",
      "Three top New Zealand law enforcement officials said they received the gifts on July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, director-general of the country\u2019s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, director-general of the technical intelligence agency GCSB.",

It required land and water to grow, machines to harvest and process, packaging to ship, trucks to transport and often refrigerators to store.

It might never get harvested, it might spoil in transit or the grocery store might reject it for being the wrong size or color. That's a big reason why some consumers are looking for less-wasteful alternatives ranging from farmers markets to delivery services for produce that didn't meet supermarket size or appearance standards.",

Then, once per week, she picks up a box of produce at the farm. Some CSA programs pick the produce, while others let you customize. Some deliver. An online database shows which farms participate in CSA programs.",
      "Since the food is grown nearby, there is less processing and packaging. \u201cThere's a smaller carbon footprint for purchasing locally compared to global or national food distribution channels,\u201d said Van Soelen Kim. \u201cWhen they\u2019re local, they\u2019re traveling less distance, so less gas, less fuel.\u201d",
      "Local farmers are also likely to grow whatever works best for the area's climate and season. \u201cWhen things are in season, they need less storage time, so less electricity for cold storage,\u201d said Van Soelen Kim, who added that can also mean a smaller food bill.",
      "It\u2019s not pollution-free, because the crops still require land and water, and the food does travel some distance. But CSAs avoid many steps in the modern food supply chain.",
      "That model is challenging for consumers who want to maintain the same shopping list year-round. Shopping in-season requires more flexibility. \u201cI would encourage consumers to think, \u2019OK, year-round we want some hand fruit that\u2019s firm,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s apples, and then it\u2019s pears, and then its gonna move to kiwis, and then is gonna move to pluots.\u201d",
      "And in colder regions, she said there is still local produce. It's just more likely to be dried, frozen or canned.",
      "Kolodinsky said the oldest alternative food system is the farmers market, where vendors gather and sell directly to consumers. Growers also sell at farm stands that aren\u2019t tied to a centralized, scheduled event.",
      "Farmers markets allow consumers more flexibility to pick the produce than a typical CSA. They also offer seasonal produce and less packaging and processing than a grocery store. Many also accept payment associated with government food assistance programs.",

      "Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said. For example, there could be onions that never got big enough or the carrot that grew two roots \u2014 vegetables that are just as safe and tasty to eat. There's also surplus harvest.",

The company's founder and CEO, Abhi Ramesh, said it minimizes emissions by having set delivery days instead of offering on-demand delivery.",

But the difference is we\u2019re able to go and transport the food waste piece, which reduces a ton of emissions.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Sales at U.S. retailers and restaurants increased modestly in September as resilient consumers moderated their spending after splurging over the summer.",
      "Sales rose 0.2% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, in a report delayed more than a month because of the government shutdown. Sales jumped 0.6% in July and August and 1% in June. Numerous reports on inflation, employment, spending, and growth remain delayed and the government won\u2019t likely be caught up until late December.",
      "The retail sales figures suggest that Americans pulled back a bit in September as many households are still struggling with high prices for groceries, rent, and many imported goods hit by tariffs. Still, the modest increase in spending may lift the economy\u2019s growth to a solid 3% or higher annual rate in the July-September quarter, economists forecast, after a sluggish 1.6% expansion in the first half of the year.",
      "At the same time, hiring has been weak and the unemployment rate has ticked higher, which could drag down consumer spendin g and the broader economy if it worsens. Unemployment rose to 4.4% in September, the highest in nearly four years, from 4.3%, according to the delayed monthly jobs report released last week.",
      "Higher-income consumers are driving much of the gains, according to data from Bank of America and reports from retailers such as Walmart, as l ower-income shoppers seek bargains and are more likely to spend more on necessities. .",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report comes before the crucial winter holiday season kicks off this weekend, when retailers earn as much as a fifth of their revenues. The National Retail Federation and other forecasters expect modest sales gains this year, compared with last year\u2019s holiday, with the NRF projecting that sales will top $1 trillion for the first time.",

The gap between higher- and lower-income households matches an August figure as the widest in nearly a decade, the bank said.",

      "Britain\u2019s Labour Party government is set to deliver a high-stakes budget aimed at fixing public finances and boosting economic growth",
      "LONDON -- After being elected in a landslide last year, Britain\u2019s Labour Party government delivered a budget it billed as a one-off dose of tax hikes to fix the public finances, get debt down, ease the cost of living and spur economic growth.",
      "A year on, inflation remains stubbornly high, government borrowing is up and the economy is turgid. The annual budget, due on Wednesday, is expected to bring more tax hikes in pursuit of the same elusive economic boom.",
      "Rain Newton-Smith, head of business group the Confederation of British Industry, said Monday that \u201cit feels less like we\u2019re on the move, and more like we\u2019re stuck in \u2018Groundhog Day.\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just businesses who are concerned. Alarmed by the government\u2019s consistently dire poll ratings, some Labour lawmakers are mulling the once-unthinkable idea of ousting Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led them to victory less than 18 months ago.",
      "Luke Tryl, director of pollster More in Common, said voters \"don\u2019t understand why there has not been positive change.",
      "\u201cThis could be a last-chance saloon moment for the government.\"",
      "The government says Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will make \u201ctough but right decisions\u201d in her budget to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "She has limited room for maneuver. Britain's economy, the world's sixth-largest, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the center-left Labour government elected in July 2024 has struggled to deliver promised economic growth.",
      "Like other Western economies, Britain\u2019s public finances have been squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "The government currently spends more than 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) a year servicing the U.K.\u2019s debt, which stands at around 95% of annual national income.",
      "Adding to pressure is the fact that Labour governments historically have had to work harder than Conservative administrations to convince businesses and the financial markets that they are economically sound.",
      "Reeves is mindful of how financial markets can react when the government\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up. The short-lived premiership of Liz Truss ended in October 2022 after her package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets, drove down the value of the pound and sent borrowing costs soaring.",
      "Luke Hickmore, an investment director at Aberdeen Investments, said the bond market is the \u201cultimate reality check\u201d for budget policy.",
      "\u201cIf investors lose faith, the cost of borrowing rises sharply, and political leaders have little choice but to change course,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has ruled out public spending cuts of the kind seen during 14 years of Conservative government, and its attempts to cut Britain\u2019s huge welfare bill have been stymied by Labour lawmakers.",
      "That leaves tax increases as the government\u2019s main revenue-raising option.",

      "The budget comes after weeks of messy mixed messaging that saw Reeves signal she would raise income tax rates \u2013 breaking a key election promise \u2013 before hastily reversing course.",
      "In a Nov. 4 speech, Reeves laid the groundwork for income tax hikes by arguing that the economy is sicker and the global outlook worse than the government knew when it took office.",
      "After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, the government signaled it preferred a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures such as a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive homes and a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers.",
      "The government will try to ease the sting with sweeteners including an above-inflation boost to pension payments for millions of retirees and a freeze on train fares.",
      "Critics say more taxes on employees and businesses, following tax hikes on businesses in last year\u2019s budget, will push the economy further into a low-growth doom loop.",
      "Patrick Diamond, professor in public policy at Queen Mary University of London, said satisfying both markets and voters is difficult.",
      "\u201cYou can give markets confidence, but that probably means raising taxes, which is very unpopular with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can give voters confidence by trying to minimize the impact of tax rises, but that makes markets nervous because they feel that the government doesn\u2019t have a clear fiscal plan.\u201d",
      "The budget comes as Starmer is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office sparked a flurry of speculation earlier this month by preemptively telling news outlets that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. What looked like an attempt to strengthen Starmer\u2019s authority backfired. The reports set off jitters verging on panic among Labour lawmakers, who fear the party is heading for a big defeat at the next election.",
      "That election does not have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.",
      "But analysts say a misfiring budget could be another nail in the coffin of Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cBoth Starmer and Reeves are really unpopular,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThey may be hanging on for now, but I don\u2019t think people will be giving you great odds that they\u2019ll necessarily last the course of the Parliament,\u201d which runs until the next election.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- For two hours every day, Lee Si-young and her colleagues broadcast uncensored foreign news into authoritarian North Korea. Her radio audience could go to jail if caught listening.",
      "Lee's Seoul-based Free North Korea Radio station has tried for two decades to give real-time news to North Korea's 26 million people. But Lee says she now feels a sense of crisis about her work as big government-funded broadcasters in the United States and South Korea have fallen silent this year because of major funding cuts and policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur frustrations with the U.S. and South Korean governments are growing over their suspensions of radio broadcasts,\" said Lee, a defector who heads the small, nongovernmental FNK radio station. \"We're afraid that they've abandoned North Korean residents.\u201d",

That includes outside perspectives of the North's ruling Kim dynasty, more affluent and freer Western lifestyles, and success stories about defectors.",
      "But a respected academic website focused on North Korea, 38 North, assessed last month that such outside radio broadcasting toward North Korea was down by 85% after cuts made by the U.S. and South Korean governments.",

Trump said the networks had a liberal bias or were wasteful.",
      "South Korea's liberal government led by President Lee Jae Myung halted cross-border radio broadcasts in an attempt to lower animosities with North Korea. His government also turned off frontline loudspeakers blaring K-pop songs and world news, and banned activists from flying balloons with propaganda leaflets and USB sticks across the border.",
      "The FNK station is now one of several small civil or religious organizations that still transmit radio broadcasts into North Korea. Lee, the FNK head, said that VOA and RFA were much bigger than her group, which has only five workers, all defectors from North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe feel heavy-hearted and have a conflict over whether we should tell North Koreans that those suspended broadcasts were paused only temporarily and they would definitely be restarted or that we're the only one of the few who survived,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite setbacks in efforts to spread outside news in North Korea, Lee Young-hyeon, a defector-turned-lawyer in South Korea, this month launched a website and a mobile app meant to provide North Koreans with an alternative way to get outside information.",
      "Lee said his Korea Internet Studio would first target tens of thousands of North Koreans living abroad, including laborers, students, diplomats and their family members. Many of these North Koreans abroad use mobile phones with access to the global internet, a privilege citizens in the North don't have.",

      "Lee said he thinks North Korea will eventually ease its strict restrictions on the internet in a limited manner as it could allow Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and other foreign companies to open local offices in the North.",
      "Many observers are skeptical, though.",
      "Since 2020, North Korea has enacted highly oppressive laws to toughen its fight against foreign cultural influences, especially South Korea's. The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Law reportedly imposes up to 10 years of imprisonment with hard labor on those who consume, possess or spread foreign movies and music, and up to five years on those who use unauthorized radio and TV channels.",
      "Some question whether campaigns to provide outside news to North Korea have made a difference. Launches of propaganda balloons and loudspeaker broadcasts have also been a major source of tension with North Korea.",
      "In July, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young called radio and loudspeaker broadcasts \u201ca relic of the Cold War\" and expressed hope that their suspension would improve ties with North Korea. In response to questions posed by The Associated Press, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the suspension of its \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d radio broadcast was designed to ease military tensions with North Korea.",

      "Before his defection in 2003, Paek Yosep said he was shocked when South Korean radio broadcasts reported about anti-government protests in Seoul, something that is unthinkable in North Korea. Paek said when he served as a soldier at a frontline unit, he enjoyed listening to music blared from South Korean loudspeakers across the border.",

      "Tyson Foods\u2019 decision to close a beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska, could devastate the small city and undermine the profits of ranchers nationwide",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyson Foods' decision to close a beef plant that employs nearly one third of residents of Lexington, Nebraska, could devastate the small city and undermine the profits of ranchers nationwide.",
      "Closing a single slaughterhouse might not seem significant, but the Lexington plant employs roughly 3,200 people in the city of 11,000 and has the capacity to slaughter some 5,000 head of cattle a day. Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.",
      "Consumers may not see prices change much at the grocery store over the next six months because all the cattle that are now being prepared for slaughter will still be processed, potentially just at a different plant. But in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs \u2014 caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs \u2014 unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.",
      "An increase in beef imports from Brazil, like President Donald Trump encouraged last week by slashing tariffs on the South American country, may help insulate consumers while ranchers and feedlots struggle with high costs and falling prices.",
      "Here's what we know about the impact of the plant closure and the changing tariffs:",
      "Clay Patton, vice president of the Lexington-area Chamber of Commerce said Monday that Tyson\u2019s announcement Friday felt like a \u201cgut punch\u201d to the community in the Platte River Valley that serves as a key link in the agricultural production chain.",
      "When it opened in 1990, the Lexington plant that Tyson later acquired revitalized and remade the formerly dwindling town by attracting thousands of immigrants to work there and nearly doubling the population.",
      "When the plant closes in January, the ripple effects will be felt throughout the community, undermining many first-generation business owners and the investment in new housing, Patton said. Tyson said it will offer Lexington workers the chance to move to take open jobs at one of its other plants if they are willing to uproot their families for jobs hundreds of miles away.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can come through this and we\u2019ll actually become better on the other side of it,\u201d Patton said.",
      "Elmer Armijo was struck by how established the community was when he moved to Lexington last summer to lead First United Methodist Church. He described solid job security, good schools and health care systems and urban development \u2014 all in doubt now.",
      "\u201cPeople are completely worried,\u201d Armijo said. \u201cThe economy in Lexington is based in Tyson.\u201d",
      "Many local churches, Armijo\u2019s included, are already offering counseling, food pantries and gas vouchers for community members.",
      "The prospect of losing a major buyer for cattle and increasing imports from Brazil, which already accounted for 24% of the beef brought into the country this year, only adds to doubts about how profitable the U.S. cattle business might be over the next several years, making it less likely that American ranchers will commit to raising more animals.",

      "Boosting imports from Brazil has the potential to affect the market \u2014 much more than Trump's suggestion to increase imports from Argentina \u2014 since the country sends more beef to America than any other. But for steak lovers, the sky-high price of the cut isn\u2019t likely to be affected regardless, as most imports are lean trimmings that get mixed into ground beef.",
      "Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said it's hard to predict whether imports will continue to account for roughly 20% of the U.S. beef supply next year. He pointed out that Trump's tariffs have changed several times since they were announced in the spring and could quickly change again.",
      "The only constant in the equation has been that consumers have continued to buy beef even as prices soar. Tonsor said on average Americans will consume 59 pounds (27 kilograms) of beef per person this year.",
      "There has long been excess capacity in the meat business nationwide, meaning the nation\u2019s slaughterhouses could handle many more cattle than they are processing. That has only been made worse in recent years as the government has encouraged more smaller companies to open slaughterhouses to compete with Tyson and the other giants that dominate the beef business.",
      "Tyson expects to lose more than $600 million on beef production this year after already reporting $720 million of red ink in beef over the past two years.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sinclair has submitted a bid to buy out E.W. Scripps for $7 per share, in a deal that could bring further consolidation across America's local TV news landscape.",
      "Under the proposal, which Sinclair disclosed Monday, the broadcast giant would acquire all of Scripps' outstanding shares that it doesn't already own. Sinclair has already upped its stake in Scripps recently \u2014 accounting for nearly 10% of the company's class A common stock as of Nov. 17, per regulatory filings.",
      "The proposed $7 per share price tag would consist of both cash and stock. If approved, the deal would give Scripps' shareholders about a 12.7% stake of the combined company upon closing.",
      "Sinclair is requesting a response from Scripps by Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe are submitting an updated, actionable merger proposal,\u201d Sinclair CEO Christopher S. Ripley wrote in a letter to Scripps\u2019 board.

      "Ohio-based Scripps acknowledged that it had received an \u201cunsolicited acquisition proposal\u201d from Sinclair on Monday.

      "Shares of E.W. Scripps Co. jumped more than 5% Monday, trading at about $4.30 apiece as of 2:30 p.m. ET. Sinclair's stock slipped just under 1%, trading around $15.50 by the afternoon.",
      "Sinclair has been eyeing Scripps for some time. Last week, the Maryland-based company said it held months of talks \u201cregarding a potential combination\u201d \u2014 and maintained more broadly that increasing its scale is \u201cessential to address secular headwinds\u201d in the U.S. media industry, pointing to growing competition.",

      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an influencer like MrBeast embrace the expertise of established philanthropy \u2014 of the Rockefeller Foundation, in particular \u2014 to hone the work of his platform,\u201d said Phila Engaged Giving founder Stephanie Ellis-Smith. \u201cHonestly, to me, it shows a sense of humility in his approach that I personally haven\u2019t seen before.\"",

      "Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations that target people all over the world. They usually involve gaining a person's confidence with romantic ploys and luring them into bogus investment schemes. The U.N.

      "There were other crackdowns earlier this year. Monday\u2019s reports said a total of 12,586 foreigners have been detained since the end of January and 9,978 of them were deported to their home countries through Thailand. Some foreigners, from African nations and elsewhere, have reported being tricked into working at the centers and being blocked from leaving them.",
      "The reports said authorities confiscated 2,893 computers, 21,750 mobile phones, 101 Starlink satellite communications devices, 21 internet routers and a large quantity of other equipment used to carry out online fraud and gambling activities at Shwe Kokko.",

      "\u201cI think the shutdown at this point is history for air travel. The airlines understand this time of year so well. They know exactly what they need to do,\u201d said Sheldon H.

      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",
      "Guangdong province, home to drone giant DJI with an estimated 70% of the global commercial drone market, leads in development of the low-altitude economy, followed by wealthy eastern coastal provinces Jiangsu and Zhejiang, near Shanghai, according to a report by a research unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and other institutions.",
      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",
      "In October, Guangdong announced it plans to speed up construction of flight service stations and platforms to facilitate airspace operations and will support locally issued discount vouchers for low-altitude tourism.",
      "Its technology and financial hub Shenzhen has launched a 15-million-yuan ($2.1 million) award for companies that earn certifications required for passenger eVTOLs, short for \u201celectric vertical take-off and landing\" vehicles that lift off the ground like helicopters, among other incentives.",
      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",
      "He envisions eventual citywide networks using the rooftops of malls, schools and parks as terminals.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a research product, nor an engineer\u2019s toy,\u201d he said.",
      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",
      "In September, two XPENG's eVTOL aircraft collided after a rehearsal for an exhibition and one of them caught fire while landing. The company said no one was hurt, but another expo canceled flying demonstrations a week later.",

      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

      "At least five families say their babies were treated for infant botulism after consuming ByHeart formula months before a current outbreak was detected",
      "As health officials investigate more than 30 cases of infant botulism linked to ByHeart baby formula since August, parents who say their children were sickened with the same illness months before the current outbreak are demanding answers, too.",
      "California public health officials confirmed late Friday that six babies in that state who consumed ByHeart formula were treated for botulism between November 2024 and June 2025, up to nine months before the outbreak that has sickened at least 31 babies in 15 states.",
      "At the time, there was \u201cnot enough evidence to immediately suspect a common source,\" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement.",
      "Even now, \"we cannot connect any pre-August 1 cases to the current outbreak,\u201d officials said.",
      "Parents of at least five babies said that their infants were treated for the rare and potentially deadly disease after drinking ByHeart formula in late 2024 and early 2025, according to reports shared with The Associated Press by Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer representing the families.",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking bottles filled with ByHeart formula.",
      "Katie Connolly, 37, of Lafayette, California, said her daughter, M.C., then 8 months old, was hospitalized in April and treated for botulism after being fed ByHeart formula in hopes of helping the baby sleep.",
      "For months, neither mother had any idea where the infections could have originated. Such illnesses in babies typically are caused by spores spread in the environment or by contaminated honey.",
      "Then ByHeart recalled all of its products nationwide on Nov. 11 in connection with growing cases of infant botulism.",
      "As soon as she heard it was ByHeart, Mazziotti said she thought: \u201cThis cannot be a coincidence.\u201d",
      "ByHeart officials this week confirmed that laboratory tests of previously unopened formula found that some samples were contaminated with the type of bacteria that leads to infant botulism.",
      "Marler said at least three other cases that predate the outbreak involved babies who drank ByHeart and were treated for botulism, according to their families. One consumed ByHeart formula in December 2024. The other two were sickened later in the spring, he said.",
      "An official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said federal investigators were aware of reports of earlier illnesses but that efforts are focused now on understanding the unusual surge of dozens of infections documented since Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not necessarily part of this,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the probe. \u201cIt\u2019s just that right now, we\u2019re focusing on this large increase.\u201d",
      "Because so much time has passed and because parents of babies who got sick earlier may not have recorded lot numbers of product or kept empty cans of formula, \u201cit will make it harder to definitively link them\u201d to the outbreak, Cope said.",

      "Before this outbreak, no powdered infant formula in the U.S. had tested positive for the type of bacteria that leads to botulism, California health officials said. The number of cases also were within an expected range. A test of a can of open formula fed to a sick baby in the spring did not detect the bacterium.",
      "Then, beginning in August and through October, more cases were identified on the East Coast involving a type of toxin rarely detected in the region, officials said. More cases were seen in very young infants and more cases involved ByHeart formula, which accounts for less than 1 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S.",
      "Earlier this month, after a sample from a can of ByHeart formula fed to a sick infant tested positive for the germ that leads to illness, officials notified the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the public.",
      "Less than 200 cases of infant botulism are reported in the U.S. each year. The disease is caused when babies ingest spores that germinate in the gut and produce a toxin. The bacterium that leads to illness is ubiquitous in the environment, including soil and water, so the source is often unknown.",
      "Officials at the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program track reports of botulism and the distribution of the only treatment for the illness, an IV medication called BabyBIG.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to back down from some tariffs is being celebrated by tea importers, who say the levies have been devastating this year",
      "NEW YORK -- A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it\u2019s just causing headaches.",
      "Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won\u2019t immediately undo the damage.",
      "\u201cIt took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,\u201d says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. \u201cThat tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.\u201d",
      "While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies\u2019 effects.",
      "On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they\u2019re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports.",
      "\u201cIf I were to add up all the money I\u2019ve spent on tariffs that weren\u2019t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,\u201d says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts.",
      "Johnson\u2019s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound.",
      "He knows some customers are reconsidering.",
      "\u201cWhere is that tipping point?\u201d Johnson asks. \u201cI\u2019m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.\u201d",
      "Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn\u2019t either. Much of next year\u2019s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill.",
      "Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials.",
      "\u201cThe canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,\u201d says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts.",
      "Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor.",
      "Boston may run on Dunkin\u2019 today, but it was born on tea.",
      "The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament\u2019s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government\u2019s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don\u2019t produce.",
      "For more than 150 years, most tea has passed through U.S. ports with little to no duties.",

      "As daily cannabis use rises to historic levels in the U.S., some longtime users are finding it harder to quit",
      "BROOKLINE, Mass. -- For the past several years, 75-year-old Miguel Laboy has smoked a joint with his coffee every morning. He tells himself he won\u2019t start tomorrow the same way, but he usually does.",
      "\u201cYou know what bothers me? To have cannabis on my mind the first thing in the morning,\u201d he said, sparking a blunt in his Brookline, Mass., apartment. \u201cI\u2019d like to get up one day and not smoke. But you see how that\u2019s going.\u201d",
      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift. Across the country, people who turned to cannabis for help are finding it harder to put down.",
      "Overall, alcohol remains more widely used than cannabis. But starting in 2022, the number of daily cannabis users in the U.S. surpassed that of daily drinkers \u2014 a major shift in American habits.",
      "Researchers say the rise has unfolded alongside products that contain far more THC than the marijuana of past decades, including vape oils and concentrates that can reach 80% to 95% THC. Massachusetts, like most states, sets no limit on how strong these products can be.",
      "Doctors warn that daily, high-potency use can cloud memory, disturb sleep, intensify anxiety or depression and trigger addiction in ways earlier generations didn\u2019t encounter. Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",
      "Laboy, a retired chef, began seeing a substance-use counselor after telling his doctor he felt depressed, unmotivated and increasingly isolated as his drinking and cannabis use escalated.",
      "Naltrexone helped him quit alcohol, but he hasn\u2019t found a way to quit marijuana. Unlike alcohol and opioids, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat cannabis addiction, though research is underway.",
      "Laboy, who first smoked at 18, said marijuana has long soothed symptoms tied to undiagnosed ADHD, childhood trauma and painful experiences \u2014 including cancer treatment and his son's death. Through decades in restaurant kitchens, he considered himself a \u201cfunctional pothead.\u201d",
      "Lately, though, his use has become compulsive. After retiring, he began vaping 85% THC cartridges.",
      "\u201cThese days, I carry two things in my hands: my vape and my cellular \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Cannabis eases his anxiety and \u201csettles his spirit,\u201d but he\u2019s noticed it affects his concentration. He hopes to learn to read music, but sustaining focus at the piano has grown difficult.",
      "He\u2019s seen an addiction psychiatrist for six months, but he hasn\u2019t been able to cut back. The medical system doesn\u2019t seem equipped to help, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d Laboy said. \u201cI go to them for help, but all they say is, \u2018Try to smoke less.\u2019 I already know that \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m there.\u201d",
      "Younger users describe a similar slide \u2014 one that begins with relief and ends somewhere harder to define.",
      "Kyle, a 20-year-old Boston University student, says cannabis helps him manage panic attacks he\u2019s had since high school. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he buys cannabis illegally.",
      "In the Allston apartment he shares with fraternity brothers, they have a communal bong.",
      "When he\u2019s high, Kyle feels calm \u2014 and able to process anxious thoughts and feel a sense of gratitude. But that clarity has become harder to reach when he\u2019s sober.",

      "Arctic Wolf, the U.S. cybersecurity firm that identified the Russian campaign, wouldn't identify its customer or the city it worked with to protect their security, but said the company had no direct connection to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, the group behind the attack, known to cybersecurity experts as RomCom, has consistently targeted groups with links to Ukraine and its defense against Russia.",

      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

We\u2019ll give so many people their lives back. That\u2019s what keeps me going, and that\u2019s what makes every struggle to this point worth it.\u201d",

      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years.

      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",

      "Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks are deciding on a final deal that lacks a plan to phase out fossil fuels",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",
      "\u201cWhile far from what's needed, the outcome in Belem is meaningful progress,\u201d said former German special climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who is now a fellow at Tufts University.",
      "The conference leaders are aiming for an early afternoon meeting with all nations to approve the deal. Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

      "The New Jersey Supreme Court determined that a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma, is not generally accepted within the \u201cbiomechanical community\u201d and is therefore not \u201csufficiently reliable\u201d for admission at the trials.",
      "The 6-1 ruling deals with the trials of two men facing charges in separate cases, where the young victims showed symptoms that have come to be associated with shaken baby syndrome.",
      "The justices, using an abbreviation for the syndrome, concluded in their lengthy decision that \u201cthere was no test supporting a finding that humans can produce the physical force necessary to cause the symptoms associated with SBS/AHT in a child.\"",
      "But Justice Rachel Wainer Apter, in a strongly worded dissent, said the other justices put more weight on the views of individual biomechanical engineers over the \u201cconsensus perspective of every major medical society in the world.\u201d",
      "That, she said, includes all the medical discipline involved in the diagnosis and treatment of shaken baby syndrome \u2014 pediatrics, child abuse pediatrics, neurology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, radiology, ophthalmology and emergency medicine.",
      "Wainer Apter also noted that every other U.S. state allows testimony in court on the syndrome and \u201cevery other court that has considered the question\u201d has held such evidence as admissible.",

      "Researchers have completed a full accounting of water uses and losses in the Rio Grande-Bravo basin as it faces severe shortages throughout its range in the United States and Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande \u2014 or Rio Bravo as it's called in Mexico \u2014 has a history as deep as it is long. Indigenous people have tapped it for countless generations, and it was a key artery for Spanish conquistadors centuries ago.",
      "Today, the Rio Grande-Bravo water basin is in crisis.",
      "Research published Thursday says the situation arguably is worse than challenges facing the Colorado River, another vital lifeline for western U.S. states that have yet to chart a course for how best to manage that dwindling resource.",
      "Without rapid and large-scale action on both sides of the border, the researchers warn that unsustainable use threatens water security for millions of people who rely on the binational basin. They say more prevalent drying along the Rio Grande and persistent shortages could have catastrophic consequences for farmers, cities and ecosystems.",
      "The study done by World Wildlife Fund, Sustainable Waters and a team of university researchers provides a full accounting of the consumptive uses as well as evaporation and other losses within the Rio Grande-Bravo basin. It helps to paint the most complete \u2014 and most alarming \u2014 picture yet of why the river system is in trouble.",
      "The basin provides drinking water to 15 million people in the U.S. and Mexico and irrigates nearly 2 million acres of cropland in the two countries.",
      "The research shows only 48% of the water consumed directly or indirectly within the basin is replenished naturally. The other 52% is unsustainable, meaning reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself will be overdrawn.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.\"",
      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "He tells them to upload class notes, study guides and any other materials used in class, such as slideshows, to the chatbot, and then tell it which textbook and chapter the test will focus on.",
      "Then, students should prompt the chatbot to: \u201cQuiz me one question at a time based on all the material cited, and after that create a teaching plan for everything I got wrong.\u201d",
      "Cuny posts AI guidance in the form of a traffic light on a classroom screen. Green-lighted uses include brainstorming, asking for feedback on a presentation or doing research. Red lighted, or prohibited AI use: Asking an AI tool to write a thesis statement, a rough draft or revise an essay. A yellow light is when a student is unsure if AI use is allowed, in which case he tells them to come and ask him.",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",

AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "The president of Cyprus says some of the estimated 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas discovered in waters off the island nation could reach European markets as soon as 2027",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Some of the estimated 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas discovered in waters off Cyprus could reach European markets as soon as 2027, the Cypriot president said Wednesday, as Europe looks for more ways to wean itself off Russian energy.",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides said that the first quantity of natural gas that could be exported abroad will come from the so-called Cronos deposit, which is operated by a consortium made up of Italian company Eni and French firm TotalEnergies.",
      "Christodoulides told an energy conference that the consortium would make its final decision to move ahead with the project next year, with Cronos gas potentially reaching a processing plant in the Egyptian port city of Damietta for liquefaction and transportation to European markets by ship in 2027.",
      "\u201cCyprus is part of the energy solutions for energy security in the eastern Mediterranean and like I said, it\u2019s an important objective to align your interests with those of powerful states and to act as an alternative energy corridor for Europe,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "Speaking at the same conference, Cypriot Energy Minister George Pananastasiou said that natural gas from the Cronos deposit could reach markets the quickest, because it can be connected to infrastructure already in place conveying gas from Egypt\u2019s huge Zor deposit around 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.",

      "A museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin has opened at the Christ Cathedral campus in Garden Grove, California",
      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "\u201cAnd then one 10,000th of a second after the discharge begins, whap! These blood stains are transferred perfectly onto the cloth,\u201d Spitzer said. \"The only explanation is that body has to disappear. I mean \u2014 like Frodo\u2019s ring \u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201d",

      "However, Thanksgiving may not provide Trump with much political respite after Democrats won sweeping victories in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere earlier this month. Some research indicates that holiday meals could cost more this year, despite the president\u2019s insistence otherwise, a reminder of persistent frustration with elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is struggling to advance a plan to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine after an earlier version faced swift criticism from European allies and even some Republicans. The U.S. military is also poised to target Venezuela with military strikes, part of an anti-drug operation that could ultimately destabilize the country's leadership.",
      "In Washington, Trump faces the possibility of a splintering Republican coalition ahead of next year's midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. Some members of his party already took the rare step of crossing the president by successfully pushing legislation to force the Justice Department to release more documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.",
      "Trump faced a setback in court this week when a federal judge tossed cases against James Comey and Letitia James, two targets of the president's retribution campaign.",

      "The judge said the interim U.S. attorney, a former member of Trump's personal legal team, who obtained the indictments was illegally appointed. However, the decision was made without prejudice, so the Justice Department could try again to charge Comey and James.",
      "All of the latest developments contribute to a moment of frenetic activity for the White House, which would normally be settling in for a quiet and festive holiday season.",
      "However, despite the traditional arrival of a Christmas tree on Monday, the presidential residence will be much different this year. Although holiday tours are expected to continue, Trump's decision to demolish the building's East Wing to make room for a new ballroom has turned part of the White House grounds into a construction site.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Shut down for more than six years, part of a scenic road loop in North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park will reopen Tuesday, giving visitors a better opportunity to see wildlife and panoramic views of the rugged Badlands.",
      "The park's 21-mile (34-kilometer) loop encircles a stark landscape where the 26th president wandered as a young man in the 1880s. The area includes colorful bluffs, dramatic formations from erosion and petrified tree stumps. Visitors enjoy encountering prairie dogs, bison and wild horses on the road.",
      "Storms, the erosive landscape and aging infrastructure caused a 150-foot (45-meter) section of roadway to slump in spring 2019, with sinkholes and other problems occurring later on the road, the National Park Service said. Since then, visitors have had to turn around at a certain point, unable to see views such as Scoria Point Overlook, a vista of red rock and rolling hills.",

      "Scoria Point is one of her top spots in the park, the site of her favorite photo with her husband. A popular nature trail is nearby. The road closure later enveloped another pull-off, Badlands Overlook, with a view where \u201cthe sky goes on forever,\u201d Kman said.",
      "The road is scheduled to reopen Tuesday, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven said. Construction lasted about two and a half years on a 6-mile (10-kilometer) closed segment, ending in October.",
      "The work encompassed full road reconstruction, drainage improvements, slope reconstruction and grading, and pavement resurfacing, the Park Service said.",

      "DALLAS -- Viola Ford Fletcher, who as one of the last survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma spent her later years seeking justice for the deadly attack by a white mob on the thriving Black community where she lived as a child, has died. She was 111.",
      "Her grandson Ike Howard said Monday that she died surrounded by family at a Tulsa hospital. Sustained by a strong faith, she raised three children, worked as a welder in a shipyard during World War II and spent decades caring for families as a housekeeper.",
      "Tulsa was mourning her loss, said Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black leader of Oklahoma\u2019s second-largest city. \u201cMother Fletcher endured more than anyone should, yet she spent her life lighting a path forward with purpose.\u201d",
      "She was 7 years old when the two-day attack began on Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood district on May 31, 1921, after a local newspaper published a sensationalized report about a Black man accused of assaulting a white woman. As a white mob grew outside the courthouse, Black Tulsans with guns who hoped to prevent the man\u2019s lynching began showing up. White residents responded with overwhelming force. Hundreds of people were killed and homes were burned and looted, leaving over 30 city blocks decimated in the prosperous community known as Black Wall Street.",
      "\u201cI could never forget the charred remains of our once-thriving community, the smoke billowing in the air, and the terror-stricken faces of my neighbors,\u201d she wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Them Bury My Story.\u201d",
      "As her family left in a horse-drawn buggy, her eyes burned from the smoke and ash, she wrote. She described seeing piles of bodies in the streets and watching as a white man shot a Black man in the head, then fired toward her family.",
      "She told The Associated Press in an interview the year her memoir was published that fear of reprisals influenced her years of near-silence about the massacre. She wrote the book with Howard, her grandson, who said he had to persuade her to tell her story.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want history to repeat itself so we do need to educate people about what happened and try to get people to understand why you need to be made whole, why you need to be repaired,\u201d Howard told the AP in 2024. \u201cThe generational wealth that was lost, the home, all the belongings, everything was lost in one night.\u201d",
      "The attack went largely unremembered for decades. In Oklahoma, wider discussions began when the state formed a commission in 1997 to investigate the violence.",
      "Fletcher, who in 2021 testified before Congress about what she went through, joined her younger brother, Hughes Van Ellis, and another massacre survivor, Lessie Benningfield Randle, in a lawsuit seeking reparations. The Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed it in June 2024, saying their grievances did not fall within the scope of the state\u2019s public nuisance statute.",
      "\u201cFor as long as we remain in this lifetime, we will continue to shine a light on one of the darkest days in American history,\u201d Fletcher and Randle said in a statement at the time. Van Ellis had died a year earlier, at the age of 102.",
      "A Justice Department review, launched under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act and released in January 2024, outlined the massacre's scope and impact. It concluded that federal prosecution may have been possible a century ago, but there was no longer an avenue to bring a criminal case.",
      "The city has been looking for ways to help descendants of the massacre's victims without giving direct cash payments. Some of the last living survivors, including Fletcher, received donations from groups but have not received any payments from the city or state.",

      "BUTNER, N.C. -- H. Rap Brown, one of the most vocal leaders of the Black Power movement, has died in a prison hospital while serving a life sentence for the killing of a Georgia sheriff\u2019s deputy. He was 82.",
      "Brown died Sunday at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina, his widow Karima Al-Amin said Monday.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, but Karima Al-Amin told The Associated Press that her husband had been suffering from cancer and had been transferred to the medical facility in 2014 from a federal prison in Colorado.",
      "Like other more militant Black leaders and organizers during the racial upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Brown decried heavy-handed policing in Black communities. He once stated that violence was \u201cas American as cherry pie.\u201d",
      "\u201cViolence is a part of America\u2019s culture,\u201d Brown said during a 1967 news conference. \u201c... America taught the black people to be violent. We will use that violence to rid ourselves of oppression, if necessary. We will be free by any means necessary.\u201d",
      "Brown was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a powerful civil rights group, and in 1968 was named minister of justice for the Black Panther Party.",
      "Three years later, he was arrested for a robbery that ended in a shootout with New York police.",
      "While serving a five-year prison sentence for the robbery, Brown converted to the Dar-ul Islam movement and changed his name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. Upon his release, he moved to Atlanta in 1976, opened a grocery and health food store and became an Imam, a spiritual leader for local Muslims.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not dissatisfied with what I did,\u201d Al-Amin told an audience in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1998. \u201cBut Islam has allowed things to be clearer. ... We have to be concerned about the welfare of ourselves and those around us, and that comes through submission to God and the raising of one\u2019s consciousness.\u201d",

      "English testified at trial that Al-Amin fired a high-powered assault rifle when the deputies tried to arrest him. Then, prosecutors said, he used a handgun to fire three shots into Kinchen\u2019s groin as the wounded deputy lay in the street. Kinchen would die from his wounds.",

      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does corporate partnerships. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy\u201d and the \u201csense of enthusiasm one can experience when you help others.\u201d",

      "A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out.",
      "Since late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.",
      "The task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.",
      "From 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.",
      "Opponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.",
      "The effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.",
      "\u201cThe human cost of it is astounding,\" said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.",
      "The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.",
      "Meanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.",
      "These issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county's district attorney.",
      "\u201cThe task force deployment probably could have used more planning,\u201d said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. \u201cMore thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.\u201d",
      "There were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force\u2019s operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.",
      "The jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.",
      "As of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings.",
      "In a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.",
      "One issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year's session.",

      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "summary": "Lea Michele, the \"Glee\" star who made her Broadway debut in \"Les Miserables\" at age eight, is now back in the same Broadway theater starring in \"Chess: The Musical.\"",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

      "After the incident, Wen shared a video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments.

    "summary": "British singer Lily Allen tells Anthony Mason about heartbreak and healing in her only TV interview about her new album, \"West End Girl.\"",
    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A lawsuit filed in Michigan last week alleges that a Campbell Soup Company executive made offensive comments about Indian workers and said the company's products were for \"poor people\" during a conversation with a former employee.",
      "The suit was filed by Robert Garza, who was hired by Campbell's as a cybersecurity analyst in September 2024.",
      "Garza alleges that Campbell's executive Martin Bally made the offensive remarks during a meeting in November 2024, which was intended to discuss his salary. According to the lawsuit, Bally made several comments about Indian workers and said that Campbell's is \"highly [processed] food\" for \"poor people.\"",
      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",
      "James Regan, a Campbell's spokesperson, said the company was not aware of the recording before it aired on WDIV on Thursday and doesn't know if it's legitimate.",
      "Bally is one of many vice presidents at Campbell's, according to Regan. His\u00a0LinkedIn lists his title as vice president and chief information security officer.",
      "\"The person alleged to be speaking on the recording works in IT and has nothing to do with how we make our food,\" Campbell's said in a statement to CBS News. The company also said Bally is temporarily on leave while the company conducts an investigation.",
      "\"If the comments were in fact made, they are unacceptable,\" the company said. \"The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate \u2014 they are patently absurd.\"",
      "Campbell's also defended the quality of its products, noting the company uses \"100% real chicken in our soups.\"",
      "On Monday, James Uthmeier, the Attorney General of Florida, said\u00a0in a social media post that the state's Consumer Protection division is investigating the quality of Campbell's products.",
      "Runyan Law Group, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of Garza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "story": [
      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",
      "Rad said it tested its batteries at independent third-party labs, which confirmed that the batteries met the industry's highest standards.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the CPSC does not dispute the conclusions of these tests,\" a Rad spokesperson added in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Rad also pointed out that all lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are improperly charged or mishandled, and that Rad advises against misusing them in its customer safety guides.",
      "Rad added that it had hoped to work with the CPSC to help its customers upgrade to the company's \"Safe Shield\" batteries, which incorporate new technology, at a discounted rate. Rad said the commission's request that Rad either offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers would put it out of business.",
      "The batteries cost $550 alone, or between $1,500 and $2,000 when sold with e-bikes.",

      "Stocks have been swinging sharply, not just day to day but also hour to hour, in recent weeks as worries weigh about what the Fed will do with interest rates and whether too much money is pouring into AI and creating a bubble.

    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",

      "Bender is a retail veteran with 30 years of experience at retailers from Walmart to PepsiCo.",
      "Buchanan, who was Kohl's CEO for less than four months, had replaced CEO Tom Kingsbury, who had served as the company's leader from 2023 until early 2025. Prior to Kingsbury, Michelle Gass was Kohl's CEO until she departed in late 2022 to become the president of Levi Strauss.",

    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Those sinful-looking blueberry pancakes, and that nice, noisy foamy latte \u2013 would you believe they are rescuing journalism, in and around Camden, Maine, at least?",
      "Here in lobster country, at the Villager Cafe, customers can have their breakfast or lunch with a side of news, a weekly newspaper called the Midcoast Villager. \"I was just reading about the SNAP benefits and different food pantries in the area,\" said one cafe customer.",
      "The cafe subsidizes the paper; the newsroom is one floor up. Throw in the rent from all the other tenants in the building, along with revenue from the Inn at Camden Place next door (same ownership), and it all helps.",
      "\"From the business standpoint, it achieves a sustainability,\" said Reade Brower. At one time, Brower owned almost all of Maine's newspapers, before selling most of them off. In September 2024, he merged four weeklies into the Midcoast Villager. The cafe opened this past April, but not just to make money.",
      "\"The accountability issues and local sports and all that stuff is important to a lot of people,\" he said. \"I don't think that's enough to sell and keep newspapers alive right now. I think it has to revolve around community. And what better way to serve community than to invite people here for food and to mix all this stuff together?\"",
      "How often do you see the owner of a newspaper, and members of his staff, hanging out with readers over breakfast?",
      "Kathleen Capetta helps Brower run what they both see as an experiment in rebuilding trust in news. \"We're present, we're visible, we're real,\" she said. \"We're not behind a screen.\"",
      "And would that experiment work if the food weren't good? \"Absolutely not, no!\" Capetta laughed.",
      "\"It's good, classic diner food, but a little bit elevated, which is I think kind of like our paper,\" said deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald. He is the face of the newspaper when he parks himself in the cafe on Friday mornings, to hear complaints, story tips, whatever. \"Having a place where people can vent, or can say something, and have it be heard, I think is really valuable,\" he said.",
      "Seitz-Wald was an NBC politics reporter in Washington, D.C., for a decade before taking a chance \u2013 and a pay cut \u2013 to work for the Midcoast Villager, a start-up in a field where two newspapers die every week.",
      "How's the Villager doing? Circulation revenue, we're told, is 40% above what all four papers it replaced took in \u2013 so, promising.",
      "\"I'm quite glad that I still have a newspaper to work for,\" said Glenn Billington. A local news lifer, he's the optimistic ad salesman and columnist for the Midcoast Villager, just as he was for one of its now-defunct predecessors.",
      "The mascot on the paper's masthead is Vern, who is the epitome of Midcoast Maine. \"He sure is,\" said Billington. \"Look at his sou'wester. He's got the hat that you wear when the wind blows from the southwest and it brings rain. And he's got the telescope. Vern's looking at the future of newspapers.\"",
      "What one sees at the Villager Cafe is old-fashioned \u2013 people sitting down at tables, eating and talking and looking at each other eye-to-eye. Or as Brower put it, \"You're picking up what we're putting down.\"",

      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you\u00a0don't have a Real ID\u00a0the next time you fly, it could cost you.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration has proposed a rule that would charge travelers who lack a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published Thursday in the Federal Register.",
      "\"This notice serves as a next step in the process in REAL ID compliance, which was signed into law more than 20 years ago and finally implemented by Secretary Noem as of May 2025,\" a TSA spokesperson told CBS News, noting that the agency would soon provide additional guidance. \"TSA is working with stakeholders and partners to ensure both security and efficiency at our checkpoints.\"",
      "Embracing biometrics",
      "The TSA is launching a biometric identity verification program at its checkpoints to screen individuals who don't have a Real ID or other suitable alternative form of identification, such as a passport.",
      "Alternative ID verification methods are \"time and resource intensive,\" the TSA said in proposing the fee.",
      "\"To address the government-incurred costs, individuals who choose to use TSA's modernized alternative identity verification program will be required to pay an $18 fee,\" the agency's proposed rule states.",
      "Verifying people's identity at the nation's airports \"is the first step in the physical screening process at a TSA security checkpoint and the last link in intelligence-based traveler prescreening, ensuring that high-risk travelers are identified. ...\" the proposal states.",
      "The TSA said that biometric verification, which it also refers to as a registered traveler program, will streamline the process of identifying passengers.",
      "Passengers will start incurring the $18 fee when the TSA announces that individuals may register for the alternative identity verification program at TSA.gov.",
      "Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, thinks the fee proposal is reasonable, given that travelers have had ample time to obtain a Real ID.",
      "\"For years, they've been saying either get a Real ID or a passport or don't travel,\" he told CBS News. \"So the idea that you can pay $18 and potentially travel anyway isn't so unreasonable.\"",

      "The TSA began requiring passengers to\u00a0present a Real ID\u00a0or other approved documents in May. The enhanced form of identification can either be a driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card.",
      "\"The fact that TSA is floating an identity-verification fee suggests things are tightening,\" said Sarah Silbert, a strategist at flight search engine Points Path. \"If you haven't updated your ID yet, it's smart to take care of it soon, especially with peak travel season adding extra stress for everyone.\"",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to Washington before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",

      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Umerov\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0on Tuesday that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Mr. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",

The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:29:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Two turkeys are traveling Tuesday from the posh Willard Hotel to the White House, becoming the latest turkeys to be pardoned by an American president in a tradition that officially dates back to President George H.W. Bush.",
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump will be presented with two turkeys, Waddle and Gobble, from the National Turkey Federation.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "Mr. Trump will be traveling to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, as he did nearly every Thanksgiving in his first term. Former President Joe Biden, meanwhile, traveled to Nantucket over the weekend, per his daughter's Instagram, a Biden family tradition for\u00a0over 40 years.",

    "summary": "The rulings\u200b from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "The rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for Comey and James, who both argued their prosecutions are retaliatory and motivated by President Trump's efforts to punish his political foes.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her ruling in the James case.",
      "Currie ordered the indictments to be dismissed without prejudice, which would allow prosecutors to seek charges again. She suggested that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in Comey's case since the statute of limitations for the offenses expired at the end of September.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking at an unrelated news conference in Memphis on Monday, told reporters the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "Lawyers for both Comey and James are also seeking to have their indictments tossed out on numerous other legal grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective. The judge overseeing Comey's case heard arguments on his motion last week but has yet to rule.",
      "\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement in response to the ruling. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"",
      "In a video statement, Comey said \"the message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News, \"We believe the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position, but she was in fact legally appointed.\"",
      "The judge's rulings",
      "In her decisions, the judge found that Halligan's appointment violated both a federal law known as Section 546, which governs U.S. attorney vacancies, and the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "In evaluating the text of Section 546, Currie found that the power to name an interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for 120 days to fill the current vacancy rested not with the attorney general, but with district court for the region. She wrote that if the government's interpretation of the law were correct, then the president could evade the Senate confirmation process \"indefinitely\" by \"stacking\" consecutive 120-day appointments.",
      "\"In sum, the text, structure, and history of section 546 point to one conclusion: the Attorney General's authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney lasts for a total of 120 days from the date she first invokes section 546 after the departure of a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney,\" Currie wrote. \"If the position remains vacant at the end of the 120-day period, the exclusive authority to make further interim appointments under the statute shifts to the district court, where it remains until the President's nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework.\"",
      "She concluded that Halligan has been unlawfully serving as interim U.S. attorney since Sept. 22. Comey was indicted Sept. 25, and James was charged Oct. 9.",
      "Halligan's appointment",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in one of the criminal cases brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. She took over as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in a temporary capacity in late September and sought the indictments against Comey and James soon after.",
      "Bondi tapped Halligan as interim U.S. attorney shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Bondi appointed Halligan under Section 546, the federal law that governs U.S. attorney vacancies and allows the attorney general to select an interim U.S. attorney, who can then serve for 120 days. The Trump administration has invoked that law and another measure to install temporary prosecutors in New Jersey, Nevada and Los Angeles, though three different federal judges have all found they were serving unlawfully.",
      "In the U.S. Attorney's Office in eastern Virginia, Siebert had first been tapped to lead the office in January to serve for 120 days. Ahead of the expiration of his term, the federal court for the region voted to keep him in the role, exercising authority granted to it under federal law.",
      "After Siebert departed, though, Mr. Trump urged Bondi to install Halligan in the post. Bondi issued a September order purporting to name Halligan as the interim U.S. attorney, to serve for 120 days. Days after she took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Halligan secured the two-count indictment against Comey, which accuses him of lying to Congress during testimony in September 2020 and obstructing a congressional proceeding. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted in early October on charges of bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.",
      "Comey's attorneys argued that his indictment was \"fatally flawed\" because Halligan, who alone presented the case to the grand jury and signed the indictment, was invalidly appointed to her position.",
      "They argued that under the framework for a temporary U.S. attorney appointment, the 120-day clock starts from the time of the attorney general's initial appointment of Siebert and limits the total tenure of interim appointments to 120 days. Because Siebert had already served the 120 days, only the district court had authority to appoint a successor, defense lawyers said.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers defended the validity of Halligan's selection and argued the 120-day limit applies on a \"per-appointment basis.\" Each appointment, they said, triggers its own clock and requires the attorney general to revisit her interim selections every 120 days.",
      "To shore up Halligan's work in Comey and James' cases, the Justice Department submitted to the court an October order from Bondi that also purported to name her special attorney, applied retroactively, and ratified her actions before the grand juries and signature on the indictments.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued that even if Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid, any government lawyer can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment, and Bondi has the authority to make her a government attorney.",
      "But Currie rejected Bondi's attempt to retroactively name Halligan as a special attorney and wrote that the Justice Department has not pointed to any authority that allows the attorney general to \"reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.\" She also said the attorney general's attempt to ratify Halligan's actions falls short.",
      "\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street \u2014 attorney or not \u2014 into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"",
      "Currie heard arguments on Comey's bid to dismiss the case on the appointment grounds earlier this month alongside the similar effort by James. Like in Comey's case, only Halligan presented the case against James to the grand jury and signed the indictment.",
      "Asked on Monday if the ruling would have any impact on Halligan's role, Bondi told reporters, \"it does not.\"",
      "\"We have made Lindsay Halligan a special U.S. attorney so she is in court,\" Bondi said. \"She can fight in court just like she was, and we believe we will be successful on appeal.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

      "Michael Krastios, science adviser to the president, told reporters on a conference call the Genesis mission is \"the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program.\"",
      "\"By fusing massive federal data sets, advanced supercomputing capabilities, and world-leading scientific facilities, the Genesis mission will use AI to automate experiment design, accelerate simulation and generate protective models for everything from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics,\" Krastios said. \"This will shorten discovery timelines from years to days or even hours, empowering scientists to test bolder hypotheses and discover breakthroughs currently unreachable.\"",
      "White House officials told reporters on the conference call that they want to bring in AI supercomputing capacity that the private sector is building. The White House said there's been significant interest from the private sector from companies that include Nvidia and Dell.",
      "The effort will begin with the existing supercomputers at the Department of Energy's 17 national labs, although the administration intends to build more supercomputers.",
      "It's not clear, however, how the mission will be funded, and White House officials suggested that more help from Congress could be needed down the road. One of the officials on the call said the Energy Department already operates \"some of the best supercomputing facilities in the world.\" The official said that the administration will leverage all available resources and, with the help of Congress would \"continue to invest increasing amounts for the success of the mission.\"",
      "\"I think we will see unbelievable advancements in health sciences, so many diseases today that are unfortunate death sentences,\" one of the officials on the call said. \"We're going to understand the exact chemistry and biology that they are and how to combat that. We've seen progress with that relatively significant progress the last five years. It's nothing compared to what we're going to see in the next five years.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:21:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

    "summary": "Fewer than one-third of those arrested by Border Patrol during the recent immigration crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, a government document says.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that the aluminum ingredients in vaccines cause a variety of harmful reactions, from allergies to autism. Scientists say that's wrong and warn of risks if they're removed.",
    "story": [
      "As the federal government prepares for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body's immune response.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.",
      "But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.",
      "Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of \"adjuvants and contaminants\" is on the vaccine advisory panel's draft agenda.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a \"deceitful propaganda stunt\" and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.",
      "And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP \"is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.\"",
      "The stakes are high because Kennedy's push to cast doubt on aluminum isn't just about the ingredient itself. It's part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.",
      "But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.",
      "\"Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth's surface,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"So we're all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.\"",
      "Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body \u2014 a combined total of about 8 milligrams \u2014 after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.",
      "\"I don't know why there is so much concern,\" said Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. \"Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.\"",
      "How they work",
      "The aluminum in vaccines isn't foil or metal. It's a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.",
      "It's a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don't swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.",
      "In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.",
      "When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.",
      "Dr. Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they're injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they're meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, \"you don't see that effect.\"",
      "In response to Kennedy's claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn't mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.",
      "Animal experiments",
      "Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy's claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.",
      "\"That's the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,\" HogenEsch said. \"I'm not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don't really see a way by which this could happen.\"",
      "Dr. Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. \"Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.\"",
      "Dr. Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don't match what happens in people, because \"mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.\" In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn't automatically apply to human immune systems.",
      "And in this case, it's \"important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,\" Kaufmann said.",
      "Human studies",
      "Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.",
      "In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.",
      "\"That paper was roundly criticized,\" Offit said. \"When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.\"",
      "\"It should have never been published,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.",
      "\"When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,\" she said. \"The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,\" she said, adding that \"there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.\"",
      "Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Dr. Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.",
      "\"It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,\" Hviid said.",
      "Hviid's nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.",
      "\"Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It's free, and there's universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,\" he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.",
      "Rare bumps",
      "Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called \"pruritic granulomas.\" These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.",
      "This reaction \"doesn't lead to something bad, and it really isn't associated with anything other than that local irritation,\" Edwards said.",
      "Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response \u2014 meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy \u2014 that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body's own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.",
      "Eliminating aluminum adjuvants",
      "For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein \u2014 such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV \u2014 adjuvants are crucial.",
      "Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn't realistic.",
      "\"They're kind of all built on one another,\" she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they're tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.",
      "Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over \u2014 all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.",
      "\"The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they're being used and being very safe,\" HogenEsch said. \"It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.\"",
      "A century of safe use",
      "The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.",
      "\"We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,\" Edwards said. \"I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.\"",
      "If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.",
      "In their view, the real danger isn't the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It's rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.",
      "That's the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. \"A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,\" he said. \"It's just a choice to take a different risk.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The granddaughter of late President John F. Kennedy,\u00a0Tatiana Schlossberg, announced Saturday that she has less than a year to live amid a cancer diagnosis.",
      "The 35-year-old journalist published an essay in the New Yorker magazine, writing that after she gave birth to her second child, a baby girl, in May 2024, doctors noticed her white-blood-cell count \"looked strange.\"",
      "She wrote in the magazine that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3, shortly afterward. Schlossberg, who has been married to Dr. George Moran since 2017, wrote that she couldn't believe this was happening.",
      "\"I did not\u2014could not\u2014believe that they were talking about me,\" she wrote. \"I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.\"",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg described grueling rounds of treatment including chemotherapy, several clinical trials and two bone marrow transplants, including one from her sister, Rose. But the cancer recurred, and her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",

Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis. She also lost her uncle Bobby Kennedy when he was shot and killed in 1968 while he was campaigning for the presidency.",
      "Caroline Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",
      "Schlossberg mostly focused on writing about her family, how she is going to miss living life with her \"kind, funny, handsome genius\" husband she managed to find, and what would happen to her two young children growing up without their mother.",
      "\"Mostly I try to live and be with them now,\" she wrote in The New Yorker. But she says that it is harder than it seems and tries to fill herself up with memories of her children, which she hopes she can carry with her after she is gone.",
      "\"Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead,\" Schlossberg wrote.",

      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are discussing the potential of bringing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. this week as part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, according to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Whether Zelenskyy's trip happens is dependent on the outcome of peace negotiations in Geneva on Sunday, the officials said. Mr. Trump himself has described the deadline as flexible, and he told reporters on Saturday the plan was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Speaking from Geneva, Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted progress in discussions with a cadre of European and Ukrainian officials, but said more work would need to be done.",
      "\"I think this was a very, very meaningful \u2013 I would say probably best \u2013 meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came into office in January,\" he said. \"But there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now,\" Rubio added, promising updates after additional meetings.",
      "\"We have very good progress and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace,\" said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, after meeting with Rubio.",
      "There are no hard plans for a Zelenskyy visit at this moment given the active diplomacy nor are there scheduled talks with or in Russia at this point, according to a senior White House official. Another possible outcome of the negotiations in Geneva is that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll could travel to Russia or meet with Russian officials elsewhere, according to another U.S. official. Russian officials told CBS News that nothing yet is scheduled.",
      "Ukraine's response to the 28-point memo",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all the terms in the draft 28-point peace plan that leaked to the press last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",
      "Stefanishyna said that Russia has not made any concessions to date and that none of the points in the leaked 28-point plan are related to forcing anything on the Russian side.",
      "In addition to the proposal, an early draft of which was leaked by an opposition politician in Ukraine and verified by the White House, there is an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Stefanishyna also confirmed that there is an additional document to the 28 points and referred to it as \"the framework of security assurances.\" She said it states the intention of the U.S. to provide something along the lines of Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty, such as a defense promise. However, unlike that NATO guarantee, the security assurances do not have a detailed layout of security guarantees nor the weight of Congressional approval and backing that would come with a treaty. That is a challenge for Ukraine, Stefanishyna said, in part because of past failures by the West to live up to security assurances given when Ukraine handed over its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.",
      "Why now?",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2013 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct. While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official",
      "said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",
      "Inter-Trump administration confusion",
      "There were separate but parallel diplomatic efforts on Ukraine taking place within the Trump administration that are now being merged.",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff have been working on what they refer to as a \"term sheet\" to end the war, mimicking their broad-strokes proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. While the Trump administration put sanctions on Russian oil and gas to bring Putin to the negotiating table, Putin advisor Kirill Dmitriev was already at a table in Miami talking to Witkoff at the end of last month.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the time dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist,\" but it was Dmitriev who helped draft this 28-point proposal that the U.S. is now backing. A senior White House official told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were kept \"apprised\" of those talks, which happened in Miami last month. At a time when Zelenskyy is facing a domestic political scandal at home, the Kushner-Witkoff term sheet leaked to the press via an opposition politician in Ukraine and through an interview Dmitriev did with Axios.",
      "On Saturday, a number of senators, including Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, said that Rubio had explained to them that the 28-point proposal was not of American origin and assured them that he personally had not heard of any threat to cut off U.S. military and intelligence sharing with Ukraine if it did not agree to terms. Rubio posted Saturday on social media that the \"plan was authored by the U.S.\"",
      "However, a Ukrainian official and a U.S. official told CBS News that the threat had been made during talks with other senior U.S. officials in Kyiv. Driscoll, a close friend of Vance's, led a delegation there last week. He's now in Geneva as part of talks.",
      "A senior White House official acknowledged to CBS News that the threat to cut off aid to Ukraine may have been implied but not explicitly stated during talks with Ukraine's leadership when U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump is getting \"weary and frustrated\" and cannot keep doing this forever.",
      "The same senior White House official told CBS News that Vance and Rubio held a call Saturday night with Driscoll and U.S. military leadership in order to answer questions from lawmakers. Rubio made additional phone calls to lawmakers, which Shaheen, King and Rounds detailed",
      "\"There are many problems with the plan as it has been reported, but the two most obvious are that it rewards Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression by handing over substantial portions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, and its security guarantees against further Russian aggression are vague and inadequate,\" Senator King said in a statement Sunday. \"I hope that after consultation with Ukraine and the Europeans, a more fair and responsible agreement will emerge.\"",
      "When did the Army become involved in diplomacy?",
      "Driscoll has been in contact with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks and was originally planning to go to Ukraine in mid-December to discuss drone technology, but he was recently asked by Mr. Trump to restart talks about a ceasefire. Driscoll's role in the talks has involved details of the security guarantees being given to Ukraine.",
      "Driscoll combined his two missions on this trip. While Driscoll was en route to Ukraine, the 28-point plan was leaked by an anti-Zelenskyy politician. After this point, the Driscoll mission was \"adjusted\" to involve the emerging diplomacy building off the leaked Kushner-Witkoff term sheet, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The U.S. officials declined to discuss details of how the 28-point plan, or the additional security guarantee document have changed in the past few days.",
      "Vance has been a driving force behind the Ukraine diplomacy, according to a European diplomat and a source familiar. His close friend Driscoll has become a key conduit.",
      "Political implications",
      "The Trump administration has been reaching out in the past few days to respond to senators and congressmen including powerful, pro-Ukraine Republicans who are upset with the reported concessions being asked of Ukraine. Republican Rep Mike McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly acknowledged the outreach from Vance-Rubio and said he was assured it was a U.S. proposal not a Russian one.",
      "The Trump administration is sensitive to the idea of a rift between Rubio and Witkoff. It was Witkoff who engineered the August summit with Putin in Alaska.",
      "There has been much retroactive policymaking and recasting of events as we're seeing from the on camera remarks made by Rubio's old colleagues who may recall he was a Russia hawk during his Senate days. Since his time in the Senate, Vance has been consistent in arguing that Ukraine should not be a top priority for the U.S. Meanwhile, Witkoff has been trying to get Mr. Trump the deal to end the war that he so desires.",

      "Top U.S. and Ukrainian officials said Sunday they were making progress toward ending the\u00a0Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0as they discussed a\u00a0U.S.-proposed\u00a0plan\u00a0to achieve peace despite concerns among many of Washington's European allies that the plan was far too conciliatory to Moscow.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the first session of high-stakes talks in Geneva as \"probably the most productive and meaningful meeting\" since President Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions.",
      "\"They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,\" the statement read in part. \"Both sides reiterated their readiness to continue working together to secure a peace that ensures Ukraine's security, stability, and reconstruction.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram that the delegates had \"substantive conversations\" that would continue.",
      "\"It is important that there is dialogue with the American representatives, and there are signals President Trump's team is hearing us,\" he said. \"And it is important to ensure that the steps toward ending the war are effective, and that everything is workable.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor Zelenskyy offered specific details on any changes made to the proposed plan. Rubio left Geneva to return to Washington, D.C, following Sunday's talks, according to an official from the State Department.",
      "Earlier, Mr. Trump appeared less optimistic and used a lengthy online post to blast Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance, while shying away from criticizing Russia.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0before Sunday's talks, Mr. Trump said the Ukraine-Russia war is \"a violent and terrible one that, with strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP, would have NEVER HAPPENED.\"",
      "\"I INHERITED A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, A WAR THAT IS A LOSER FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO NEEDLESSLY DIED. UKRAINE 'LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" he wrote. \"THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE (CROOKED JOE GAVE EVERYTHING, FREE, FREE, FREE, INCLUDING \"BIG\" MONEY!). GOD BLESS ALL THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE HUMAN CATASTROPHE! President DJT.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the plan. But he also has suggested that he could push that back if there was proof of real progress and that the plan was not his final offer.",
      "The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, quickly rallying Western allies around Ukraine in a push to revise the plan, which is seen as favoring Moscow. They said in a joint statement on Saturday that while the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" additional work is required. The plan acquiesces to many of Russia's demands that Ukraine has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.",
      "After the first session, Rubio said, \"This will ultimately have to be signed off by our presidents, although I feel very comfortable about that happening given the progress we've made.\" He was joined at the talks by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Russia will also need to approve the final peace plan, Rubio said.",
      "The head of the Ukrainian delegation, presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, also confirmed an initial session of talks had concluded and that a second meeting would soon take place.",
      "After Mr. Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security, but stressed that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump for the assistance that \u2013 starting with the Javelins \u2013 has been saving Ukrainian lives. We thank everyone in Europe, in the G7, and in the G20 who is helping us defend life. It is important to preserve the support.",
      "\"It is important not to forget the main goal \u2013 to stop Russia's war and prevent it from ever igniting again.\"",
      "\"The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had privately described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. The bipartisan group of senators held a news conference, stating that they had spoken with Rubio about the peace plan after he reached out to some of them while en route to Geneva. Independent Maine Sen. Angus King said Rubio told them the plan \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",
      "Rubio on Saturday night rejected the claims,\u00a0writing\u00a0in a social media post that, \"The peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott denied their account, calling it \"blatantly false.\"",

You have the president's spokesperson going on \u2013 into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders.",
      "They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically what?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorists' families, arrest and execute\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 arrest and execute members of Congress, shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square. Need I go on?",
      "He has a history of doing this. And if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction, which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and the like. But I hear you that words matter.",
      "But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders if they have legal questions. There is a process in place.",
      "Are you telling the rank-and-file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No, absolutely not.",
      "Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military. I did three\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people downrange.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my Paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right, because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation and all of the threats and all of the things the president have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through, because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're talking about the decision of troops on the ground out in operations, right, their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law, things that are man\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these things haven't happened. You're afraid they will?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 things that are manifestly unlawful that our troops might be put in the position to carry out because that has what \u2013 that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.",
      "So, again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 which we do constantly with our service members, gets this type of response from the president.",
      "I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out. And I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "But I have talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela. There aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard.",
      "And yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful or recall their training or talk to their staff judge advocate about this.",
      "I mean, this \u2013 why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on the troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, first of all, two separate issues.",
      "So, on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson, Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, it's very clear \u2013 it's very clear what they did.",
      "I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I have been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee.",
      "So, this administration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't so much of this because of the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This \u2013 exactly right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Congress has the power to do this. So they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn.",
      "And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, operational decisions, decisions to go to war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 the White House says that was not an act of war; it's foreign policy and the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, we have been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7,000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly.",
      "Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it. And Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people, and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard-earned money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This president doesn't want that process to happen.",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the president said is very serious.",
      "I didn't think he would step over the \u2013 over that line, calling for the execution of members of Congress. And his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that.",
      "And because of what he says, there is now an \u2013 increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security. But, as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we \u2013 I understand what political violence is. The president should as well.",
      "Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and should \u2013 he should understand that his words have \u2013 you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I don't know. I have heard them say, you know, very little about this.",
      "I think, you know, the president tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death.",
      "Those are serious words coming from the president of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is, we reiterated what basically is the rule of law\u2026",

      "And it's \u2013 it's questionable, at best. Our \u2013 one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them.",

      "I will say this, that that \u2013 that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm\u2026",

      "But Ukraine's ambassador did tell us there's a separate security guarantee document. What \u2013 what needs to be in there that would actually protect Ukraine? Does that need to go for a vote before the U.S. Congress?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, it depends on what it is, but Congress should be involved. If there is a treaty with Ukraine on their own security, it's something that we would want to have some say in and ultimately\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The number of detainees held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reached a record high of nearly 66,000, according to data released Friday by DHS.",
      "Earlier this month, our Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported that roughly half of those in custody have no criminal charges or convictions on their record, but are being held solely because of alleged civil violations of immigration law. And now the government has confirmed it; 48 percent of current detainees lack criminal charges or convictions.",
      "Since President Trump took office, the number of noncriminal detainees arrested by ICE has increased by over 2000 percent. Our new CBS poll shows that 54 percent of Americans believe the government is stopping and detaining more people than necessary.",
      "A similar number, 55 percent, now disapprove of President Trump's handling of immigration policy. Despite growing public concern, the administration has recently expanded enforcement operations to Charlotte and other cities, giving no sign their so-called mass deportation campaign is ending any time soon.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "For more from our latest CBS News poll we're now joined by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, it's always great to have you here.",
      "It's the time of year where Americans go out and they spend a whole lot of money because they're getting ready for the holidays. So, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The story of the economy is a story about prices, as it has been for years. And people say prices are still high. Not going down. In fact, many say they're still going up. And it's a reminder that even as we talk about inflation and the macro inflation rate of change numbers, this is people walking down the aisle in a grocery store and saying, that's expensive or that's not. And simple as that is what you pick up in a poll.",
      "Now, the other part of this is about expectations, which is, at the start of this year people told us that they thought the economy was going to get better, that prices were going to come down. So, you see this sort of realization here that it is not. That's number two.",
      "But the other part of this is, as it comes back to those numbers you mentioned for the president, and his ratings for all of this. First of all, what people say they're hearing from the White House doesn't match with what they are feeling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: They say the president is making the inflation issue sound better than it really is.",
      "Now, look, some of that is just going to be any president trying to be optimistic, right? Maybe that's Trump being Trump, putting something positive out there. But, a the same time, you look at people who say they judge the president, first and foremost, on how he handles the economy, and the big majority of them say his administration is not spending enough time on it. So, it's not just about the rhetoric, it's also about the action.",
      "Now, the other part of this is, when you look at the decline in his approval ratings on handling the economy, it's kind of slow and steady down to this point, which comes back to those expectations, which is that people sort of comparing what they expected to what they're seeing now. And that's a big reason why his handling for it has slowly gone down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pocketbook politics always so important.",
      "The other big policy for this president has been immigration. And his supporters have stuck by him on that. How is he fairing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very much so. Still very strong support from the Republican base. That's right. And relatively better than he does on the economy.",
      "But speaking of the economy, there's an economic component to this too, which is, people say that the deportation program is more likely to be hurting the economy right now, making it weaker, than making it stronger. So, you go a little \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's harder to find workers?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, you go a little bit into that, right? And people say \u2013 the ones who say that they feel like it's impacting the area around them, and the ones who say they think that is for the worse, say their sense of thing is that people are staying home more as a result of this. Not necessarily going out. And so one of the things you see there is the potential or the perception of an economic impact out of the deportation program, although, yes, it still maintains strong support from Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Different topic but related. The White House is preparing for some kind of military action against Venezuela, and the president has linked this to both drug policy and immigration policy because of those Venezuelan refugees who have been coming into this country in recent years.",
      "We have lawmakers saying, not enough information is being shared. Does the public think they know what's happening?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The public is echoing exactly that sentiment, right? You get this big majority that says the administration has not yet explained what the U.S. position is, what is going on there. But then, on the other side of that, that it needs to. And even across the board, Republicans, Democrats, independent, all saying that it needs to.",
      "Now, the reason then that you'd see, as we see, this big number that say they would oppose military action in Venezuela is that that connection hasn't been made, right? So, people don't feel like they know what's going on. So you see that opposition, at least in general.",
      "The other part is, you compare that to relatively larger approval for the idea of, or the attacks on, boats and ships that the administration says are carrying drugs. That gets a little higher approval. But at the same time, you still see people saying, the administration should show evidence that there are drugs on that boat. So, it comes back to that idea of people wanting to know more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bring the public along with you in the decisions you're making.",
      "You also have been looking at the president's base, MAGA. How are they feeling and how does this idea of intervention, some kind of action overseas, settle with them? Because the president had promised America first focus at home.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right now, with regard to Venezuela, you see the MAGA Republicans, so identify as MAGA Republicans, even more supportive than non-MAGA Republicans at the idea. Why is that? Number one, they do see it as tied to drugs. They're more likely to say, if we were to go in there, that it might stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. So, they are listening to what the president is arguing, number one.",
      "Number two, for context, we have often seen MAGA Republicans more differential to the president across a range of issues, including foreign policy ones. So, we say on the Iran strikes, as well as others. And what I think what we see is, when they say America first, what they're saying is, look out for U.S. interests, number one. Not necessarily be entirely isolationist. But that deference to the president, among the MAGA base, has been something consistent throughout this. It is still very much about him and his connection to that MAGA base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Welcome back to the program, Senator.",
      "A lot to get to.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-KY): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on this concern about political violence, or angry rhetoric. I know the president himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You've talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the president holding himself to the same standards that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, everybody knows that the president is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty, is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible. There are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up. And, really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's pubic pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago we did see one of the convicted January 6th rioters, who was then pardoned by President Trump, arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. I mean are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called, says there's an emergency in the home. And the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this. And I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that \u2013 so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the president, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important, what is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the president on this and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to by their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country, an independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on homeland security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations. And it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the cartel de la Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Secretary Hegseth says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table he says militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think by doing this they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So, it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's a different rule of engagement. It's one of war.",
      "But, you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up. And we said, if it's war, let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, they're narco terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water, they don't prosecute them for drugs, they don't collect drugs, they don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador. But nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word.",
      "And I've been given zero, not one briefing because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand-select people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual given your homeland security role and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy according to the president.",
      "I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30 to 45 percent increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DOD boat strikes, and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs.",
      "In other words, there's still demand for the drugs, and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the president's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution.",
      "The war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs, the price goes up and more people are attracted to it.",
      "You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who were offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean. And so, there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America.",
      "There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments, but that's not what this is. And I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas. And it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump. And so, when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were, oh my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried.",
      "And then the first year or so people are like, oh, well, Rubio's doing a good job on foreign aid and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think that people supporting the president have been very supportive of the secretary of state. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the president because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table. No specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine face as choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. This consultation are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28-point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with Ukraine in the litigation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our \u2013 and on their side. So, consultations are still ongoing. But there has been a number of points, which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, it is not seen this way from the proposal, which is on the table. In fact \u2013 in fact, none of the points are actually related to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is \u2013 it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and a \u2013 and a prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about justice. This plan is not about the justice. And the truth of this war and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",

      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know. And this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side. And under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, the discussions are ongoing and we believe that the fair piece is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",

There was quite a few, you know. We had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely \u2013 extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and the vice president on a the phone call. There was like a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were less emotional. But here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war. And Russia is not part of the process formally.",

      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework. Like, of the security assurances from the United States. So, this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the formal or detailed layout for what security guarantees is \u2013 that is the \u2013 like documents specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article Five of the Washington NATO treaty.",
      "So, it's still very different and it specifies \u2013 it's been in the public access. So, it's been publicly leaked as well. So, that U.S. will stand up together with their allies in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation.",
      "I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression start, in fact, from Bella Russian territory. So, they're like a lot of nuances and this needs to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So, you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies, you want America to say that it will come to Ukraine for that (ph)?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Yes, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances. But we have like the real document in front of our eyes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: And what is really important that we had. We are very complicated partner for U.S. because we also had a lot of different sad experience like Budapest memorandum, where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had.",

      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Pokrovsk, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries. And on a regular, within one week there are more than 1,000 combat (ph) engagements happening on all the front line. And the Russia has tried to present that it's only happen in Pokrovsk, right? So, this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why, I mean, Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line but definitely not the only one.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona criticized President Trump for his recent comments, in which the president accused him and other Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior,\" with Kelly saying Mr. Trump should understand that his words \"could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "\"His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,\" Kelly said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Democrats have railed against the president in recent days after he posted Thursday on social media that a group of lawmakers who urged members of the military to disobey illegal orders should be arrested and face trial for \"seditious behavior.\" In another post, Mr. Trump also said \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" He also reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"",
      "The president's posts came in response to a video featuring Kelly and Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. In the video, the lawmakers, who are veterans and former national security officials, cited threats to the Constitution while urging service members and members of the intelligence community to \"refuse illegal orders.\"",
      "Crow, who appeared separately on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said that the video referred to orders that are \"manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.\"",
      "Crow listed several examples of what he considered to be unlawful orders, like threatening to send troops into Chicago or to polling stations.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president does not want to execute members of Congress. And Mr. Trump clarified on Fox News Radio Friday that \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.\" Then, late Saturday, the president again railed against the lawmakers in a post on Truth Social, saying the lawmakers who made the video \"SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.\"",
      "\"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Kelly said the president is \"trying to intimidate us.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to be intimidated,\" he said, noting that Crow, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" is \"not going to be intimidated either.\"",
      "\"We both served our country,\" Kelly said. \"We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law. Members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.\"",
      "Kelly's wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot at a political event in 2011, and he noted that \"as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, I understand what political violence is.\"",
      "\"The president should as well,\" Kelly said, referring to the July 2024 assassination attempt in which a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "Crow, whose district office reported a bomb threat late Saturday, said he didn't know yet whether the threat was credible, but he said it's \"very disturbing stuff.\"",
      "\"When you have the president of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it,\" Crow said. \"We've seen before a pattern of insightful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president, and then people acting on that.\"",
      "The Colorado Democrat cited his experience of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, calling it a \"very similar dynamic.\"",
      "\"He's been doing this for years,\" Crow said. \"Saying things in total disregard for the outcome and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.\"",
      "Crow said on top of the \"irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric,\" it's also \"so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation, to do that, he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution.\"",
      "\"That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" Crow said.",
      "The veterans and former national security officials wanted to \"start a conversation\" about \"the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way,\" Crow said.",
      "\"If we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them,\" he added. \"We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.\"",

      "\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene said in a post on X.",
      "Greene announced\u00a0Friday that she will resign from Congress in January, expressing frustration with her party while pointing to her dramatic break with Mr. Trump, who pulled his support from Greene a week earlier. Her latest comments denying a presidential bid came in response to an article from Time, which reported that the Georgia Republican has considered running for president in the 2028 cycle. Greene previously pushed back on reporting from NOTUS that she was telling people she wants to run for president as well.",
      "\"Running for President requires traveling all over the country, begging for donations all day everyday to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, arguing political talking points everyday to the point of exhaustion, destroying your health and having no personal life in order to attempt to get enough votes to become President all to go to work into a system that refuses to fix any of America's problems,\" Greene said Sunday. \"The fact that I'd have to go through all that but would be totally blocked from truly fixing anything is exactly why I would never do it.\"",
      "Greene said she is \"not motivated by power and titles,\" while arguing that the \"Political Industrial Complex has destroyed our country and will never allow someone like me or you to rise to power and actually solve the crises that plague all of us.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed Thursday to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, later said in an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0that he personally ordered the change.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed Kennedy during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Nicole  Brown Chau and \n                                                  \n                      Paula  Cohen",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal\u00a0brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal\u00a0have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.",
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",

      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:56:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",

      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",
      "Customers qualify for an automatic payment if they signed up for Prime or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their membership through Amazon's \"challenged enrollment flow,\" defined as \"any version of the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" according to a September\u00a0court order.",
      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",

    "summary": "The chipmaker's record growth will allay investor concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",

    "summary": "The 2025 hurricane season is drawing to a close without a single one making landfall in the continental United States.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 hurricane season is drawing to a close without a single one making landfall in the continental United States \u2014 for the first time in a decade.",
      "After developing in tropical Atlantic waters near the equator, multiple storms this year initially appeared to be following paths that could have taken them toward the U.S. East Coast. But as they got closer, all of the systems that formed since the start of the season on June 1 ultimately veered northward and traveled back out to sea.",
      "\"They began to turn northward, away from the U.S. coastline, over and over again. We saw that repeatedly,\" said Greg Postel, a meteorologist at The Weather Channel. \"It was really the dominant mode of the hurricane tracks this year.\"",
      "It was an unusual phenomenon, at least compared with recent years. Postel said many who studied this hurricane season will likely remember it as \"the year of the 'recurvature,'\" which is when hurricanes \"curve\" away from land instead of striking it. That pattern can result from a variety of atmospheric conditions interacting with each other, according to Postel and other experts.",
      "Winds and air pressure",
      "All told, this hurricane season brought 13 named storms \u2014 four of which were major hurricanes. September and October saw four hurricanes alone, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, striking Jamaica as one of the strongest on record.",
      "But none of those hurricanes hit the U.S. directly. Only a single tropical storm, Chantal, came ashore in July near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, causing flash floods that knocked out power, damaged buildings and left at least four people dead, authorities said at the time.",
      "And while there's technically still time for another hurricane before the season officially ends on Nov. 30, a named storm hasn't formed this late in the year since at least 1991, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Experts point to winds and air pressure as key factors in this year's hurricane movement.",
      "Hurricanes tend to travel westward from an origin point in the tropical Atlantic, but certain atmospheric conditions that steer the storms in one direction or another can cause them to \"recurve\" toward the east, said Matthew Rosencrans, the lead hurricane season forecaster at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center. Those conditions essentially sweep hurricanes northward, parallel to the East Coast of the U.S., before pushing them back out to sea.",
      "\"When I look at the steering currents, the winds that determine where the hurricanes go at the core of the season, there was basically a big upper-level trough \u2014 an area of low pressure that hung out over the eastern U.S.,\" Rosencrans told CBS News. \"It's spinning out there, and it's picking up these storms and causing them to go more to the north rather than continue their track to the west and potentially enter the Caribbean or the Gulf, at which point they're almost guaranteed to hit the U.S.\"",
      "The area of low pressure weakened part of something known as the Bermuda High, which is among the leading forces influencing a hurricane's path. Where and when a hurricane is steered, and whether it travels northward, depends on the strength and location of the Bermuda High during a hurricane season, according to NOAA's hurricane research division.",
      "Also called a \"subtropical high,\" the Bermuda High is a ridge of high pressure in the North Atlantic where air circulates in a clockwise direction. A strong Bermuda High pushes hurricanes farther west before turning them northward, toward Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, whereas a weaker Bermuda high turns them northward sooner, either toward the East Coast or out to sea.",
      "The upper-level trough that lingered over the East Coast took shape in tandem with a dip in the jet stream, which together produced a low-pressure area close to the surface of the ocean just several hundred miles from land, said Rosencrans. That weakened the western part of the Bermuda High, just several hundred miles from the shores of the continental U.S., and pushed the high-pressure ridge in the opposite direction.",
      "Postel noted that such a pattern in the jet stream \"is very good at deflecting incoming tropical systems out to sea.\"",
      "\"Why [the dip in the jet stream] was there globally, in the sort of scheme of the general circulation, is not entirely clear, but it's certainly something that characterized this hurricane season,\" he said. \"Because without it, without that trough there in those crucial moments, we would have looked back on this hurricane season very, very differently.\"",
      "Previous years without continental U.S. landfalls",
      "A full season without any hurricane landfalls isn't unheard of, although it is fairly uncommon. In the last 25 years, excluding this one, there were seven in which no hurricanes struck the mainland U.S.: 2000, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015, according to the hurricane research division at NOAA.",
      "Data show no hurricanes made U.S. landfall in 1990 or 1994, either.",
      "Recent hurricane seasons by the numbers",
      "2024: Five hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 total named storms, including 11 hurricanes.2023: One hurricane made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2022: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 17 named storms, including eight hurricanes.2021: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 21 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2020: Six hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 31 named storms, including 14 hurricanes.2019: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 20 named storms, including six hurricanes.2018: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 16 named storms, including eight hurricanes.2017: Three hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 named storms, including 10 hurricanes.2016: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 16 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2015: No hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 12 named storms, including four hurricanes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:29:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Two turkeys are traveling Tuesday from the posh Willard Hotel to the White House, becoming the latest turkeys to be pardoned by an American president in a tradition that officially dates back to President George H.W. Bush.",
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump will be presented with two turkeys, Waddle and Gobble, from the National Turkey Federation.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "Mr. Trump will be traveling to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, as he did nearly every Thanksgiving in his first term. Former President Joe Biden, meanwhile, traveled to Nantucket over the weekend, per his daughter's Instagram, a Biden family tradition for\u00a0over 40 years.",

      "A lawsuit filed in Michigan last week alleges that a Campbell Soup Company executive made offensive comments about Indian workers and said the company's products were for \"poor people\" during a conversation with a former employee.",
      "The suit was filed by Robert Garza, who was hired by Campbell's as a cybersecurity analyst in September 2024.",
      "Garza alleges that Campbell's executive Martin Bally made the offensive remarks during a meeting in November 2024, which was intended to discuss his salary. According to the lawsuit, Bally made several comments about Indian workers and said that Campbell's is \"highly [processed] food\" for \"poor people.\"",
      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",
      "James Regan, a Campbell's spokesperson, said the company was not aware of the recording before it aired on WDIV on Thursday and doesn't know if it's legitimate.",
      "Bally is one of many vice presidents at Campbell's, according to Regan. His\u00a0LinkedIn lists his title as vice president and chief information security officer.",
      "\"The person alleged to be speaking on the recording works in IT and has nothing to do with how we make our food,\" Campbell's said in a statement to CBS News. The company also said Bally is temporarily on leave while the company conducts an investigation.",
      "\"If the comments were in fact made, they are unacceptable,\" the company said. \"The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate \u2014 they are patently absurd.\"",
      "Campbell's also defended the quality of its products, noting the company uses \"100% real chicken in our soups.\"",
      "On Monday, James Uthmeier, the Attorney General of Florida, said\u00a0in a social media post that the state's Consumer Protection division is investigating the quality of Campbell's products.",
      "Runyan Law Group, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of Garza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "story": [
      "After more than a century of munching on her favorite foods of romaine lettuce and cactus fruit, beloved Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise Gramma, the oldest resident of the San Diego Zoo, has died.",
      "Gramma was born in her native habitat and was estimated to be about 141 years old, zoo officials said. She died Nov. 20.",
      "It's not clear exactly when the tortoise arrived at the zoo, but its officials said she came from the Bronx Zoo in either 1928 or 1931 as part of their first group of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises.",
      "As the world changed around her, she delighted visitors with her sweet, shy personality. She lived through two world wars, 20 U.S. presidents and two pandemics.",
      "Her care specialists affectionately called her \"the Queen of the Zoo.\" She was suffering from bone conditions related to her old age that progressed recently before she was euthanized, the zoo said.",
      "\"Caring for such a remarkable tortoise was a privilege,\" the zoo added.",
      "Many visitors commented on social media about getting to first visit Gramma when they were young and being able to come back years later with their kids.",
      "Cristina Park, 69, said one of her earliest memories from her childhood was going to the San Diego Zoo when she was 3 or 4 years old and riding on the back of a tortoise. That's no longer allowed, but the experience inspired her to keep a small desert tortoise as a pet and learn more about tortoise conservation.",
      "\"Just how amazing it is that they managed to live through so much,\" Park said. \"And yet they're still there.\"",
      "Galapagos tortoises can live for over 100 years in the wild and close to double that in captivity.",
      "The oldest known Galapagos tortoise was named Harriet, who lived at the Australia Zoo until the age of 175. She was collected from the Galapagos Islands in 1835, when she was just the size of a dinner plate, according to the zoo. This means she hatched somewhere around 1830, and she died in 2006.",
      "Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises include 15 subspecies of tortoises from the islands, three of which were deemed extinct. The rest are all vulnerable or critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Concerted efforts have been made to breed these tortoises in captivity over the past several decades, with more than 10,000 juveniles released to the wild since 1965, according to the Gal\u00e1pagos Conservancy. Some subspecies have been brought back from the brink of extinction.",
      "In April, four Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises were born at the Philadelphia Zoo to first-time parents that were roughly 100 years old, a first in the zoo's history. In June, Zoo Miami resident and Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise Goliath became a first-time father at the age of 135.",

      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",
      "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

    "story": [
      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",
      "Rad said it tested its batteries at independent third-party labs, which confirmed that the batteries met the industry's highest standards.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the CPSC does not dispute the conclusions of these tests,\" a Rad spokesperson added in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Rad also pointed out that all lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are improperly charged or mishandled, and that Rad advises against misusing them in its customer safety guides.",
      "Rad added that it had hoped to work with the CPSC to help its customers upgrade to the company's \"Safe Shield\" batteries, which incorporate new technology, at a discounted rate. Rad said the commission's request that Rad either offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers would put it out of business.",
      "The batteries cost $550 alone, or between $1,500 and $2,000 when sold with e-bikes.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 05:06:03 -0500",
    "summary": "An increasing number of farm animal sanctuaries nationwide have started promoting an alternative version of Thanksgiving in which families \"adopt\" turkeys and donate money for their lifelong care.",
    "story": [
      "Erie, Colo. \u2014\u00a0\"Gus\" the turkey has been spending Thanksgiving week much differently than millions of other unlucky gobblers across the U.S.",
      "As he trots in a sprawling animal sanctuary on the Colorado plains, he is stopped every few steps by staff who pet him, hug him or even give him a peck on his red face. Gus has been there since 2023 after being pardoned by the governor.",
      "\"What do you think? Do you want to do snuggles today?\" Lanette Cook, education and engagement manager at the Luvin Arms Animal Sanctuary in Erie, says to Gus.",
      "Gus is among a growing number of turkeys that are being \"adopted\" instead of being covered in gravy and eaten at Thanksgiving dinner tables.",
      "An increasing number of farm animal sanctuaries across the country have started promoting this alternative version of Thanksgiving in which families \"adopt\" turkeys and donate money to their lifelong care. In return, they receive photos, certificates and sometimes even one-on-one visits with the birds.",
      "The goal: Spare a few of the tens of millions of turkeys slaughtered this time of year, many of which are raised in what animal rights advocates say are inhumane conditions in factory farms.",
      "Some people will adopt for themselves and feature their turkey's photo on their Thanksgiving table, while others will gift the adoptions to friends or family members.",
      "At Luvin Arms, a $25 donation comes with a certificate, photo and either a virtual or in-person visit, explained Kelly Nix, its executive director. Since launching the program in 2022, the sanctuary, located about 25 miles north of Denver, has seen the number of sponsorships double every year. And this year they're on track to reach their goal of $18,000, she said.",
      "Luvin Arms' website features Gus and a gaggle of turkeys along with their personality traits (Gus is very talkative!) as part of its sponsor-a-turkey program. It encourages the public to donate for the birds for Thanksgiving and maybe even rethink their holiday traditions.",
      "The funds have helped pay for extending the turkeys' outdoor pasture area, along with feeding and rescuing more turkeys. They've helped with veterinary bills, which can sometimes cost thousands of dollars because of the medical complications that arise for turkeys that come from factory farms, which breed them to grow very big in a short period of time, said Nix. In the wild, turkeys tend to live an average of three or four years, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation.",
      "But the sanctuary says the program is about more than just the turkeys or money. There's also an important educational factor, whether learning about the conditions in factory farms or that turkeys are more than just centerpieces.",
      "\"Even if it makes you stop and double think what it is you're about to do,\" said Nix. \"Or that you're like, 'wow this is a life of a sentient being,' for us, that's a conversation starter.\"",
      "Farm Sanctuary, which is located in New York and California, is believed to be the first to launch this type of turkey adoption program, kicking it off in 1986. Gene Baur, its president and co-founder, said initially the public was not only confused about the program but about the concept of rescuing farm animals altogether.",
      "In the nearly four decades since, the sanctuary has rescued thousands of turkeys. And the public has not only caught on to the concept but in some years has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, Baur said.",
      "\"We grow up with certain traditions. But just because something is a tradition doesn't mean that it needs to remain as a tradition,\" said Baur.",
      "Barn Sanctuary has had a similar program since 2023 in Chelsea, Michigan. Chase DeBack, its advocacy, education and engagement coordinator, said it's about shining a more positive light on the birds and their distinct personalities.",
      "He rattles off some of the organization's residents like they're close friends: Lewis isn't much of a people person but loves spending times with the girls. Sabrina and Hilda are always interested in what people are bringing into the coop and what everyone's doing.",
      "\"You only hear about kind of the dead turkeys,\" said DeBack. \"And so we really wanted to shine a light on the unique personalities that turkeys have and how loving and caring they are for humans and for each other.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa.

      "Viola Ford Fletcher, the oldest survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, has died at the age of 111, Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols announced Monday.",
      "\"Today, our city mourns the loss of Mother Viola Fletcher - a survivor of one of the darkest chapters in our city's history. Mother Fletcher endured more than anyone should, yet she spent her life lighting a path forward with purpose,\" Nichols said on social media.",
      "\"Mother Fletcher carried 111 years of truth, resilience, and grace and was a reminder of how far we've come and how far we must still go,\" he said. \"She never stopped advocating for justice for the survivors and descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and I hope we all can carry forward her legacy with the courage and conviction she modeled every day of her life.\"",
      "Fletcher, a grandmother of six who had been living in North Texas, told CBS News in a 2021 interview that she thought about the massacre every day.",
      "\"It will be something I'll never forget,\" she said.",
      "Tulsa's Greenwood District, which was known as \"Black Wall Street,\" was destroyed by a White mob after a Black man was accused of assaulting a White woman. At least 300 Black residents were killed, and thousands were left homeless following the daylong massacre in which White rioters attacked Black residents, looted businesses and burned buildings.",
      "The National Guard was brought in, imposing martial law and helping to round up and imprison Black people. More than 35 blocks were charred and 6,000 people were held in detention \u2014 some for up to eight days, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.",
      "\"We had friends and played outside and [would] visit with neighbors and was happy there with our parents. Just loved being there,\" Fletcher told CBS News, recalling Greenwood before the massacre.",
      "Lessie Benningfield Randle, who turned 111 earlier this month, is now the only survivor of the Tulsa Massacre.",
      "Randle, Fletcher and her brother Hughes Van Ellis, who died in 2023, were among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against the city and county of Tulsa in 2020 seeking reparations for the massacre.",
      "They testified before Congress about the violent mob's actions 100 years after the riot.",
      "\"I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams,\" Fletcher told the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties in 2021.",
      "The city of Tulsa has argued it should not be forced to pay anything because today's residents had nothing to do with what happened more than a century ago.",
      "With none of the perpetrators having ever been prosecuted for their crimes, descendants of survivors and human rights activists have long called for reparations for the continued damage done to their Oklahoma community.",
      "But some form of payment could soon be sent out.",
      "Nichols, who became the city's first Black mayor last year, unveiled in June a $105 million package to commemorate the first Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day.

      "The goal of what the White House is calling the \"Genesis Mission\" is to speed the research and scientific discovery process by analyzing massive data sets in the science, engineering, energy and health care spaces from the federal government, university and private sector with supercomputing technology. It's an AI initiative the White House hopes will result in quicker breakthroughs in areas of research including disease therapies.",
      "Michael Krastios, science adviser to the president, told reporters on a conference call the Genesis mission is \"the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program.\"",
      "\"By fusing massive federal data sets, advanced supercomputing capabilities, and world-leading scientific facilities, the Genesis mission will use AI to automate experiment design, accelerate simulation and generate protective models for everything from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics,\" Krastios said. \"This will shorten discovery timelines from years to days or even hours, empowering scientists to test bolder hypotheses and discover breakthroughs currently unreachable.\"",
      "White House officials told reporters on the conference call that they want to bring in AI supercomputing capacity that the private sector is building. The White House said there's been significant interest from the private sector from companies that include Nvidia and Dell.",
      "The effort will begin with the existing supercomputers at the Department of Energy's 17 national labs, although the administration intends to build more supercomputers.",
      "It's not clear, however, how the mission will be funded, and White House officials suggested that more help from Congress could be needed down the road. One of the officials on the call said the Energy Department already operates \"some of the best supercomputing facilities in the world.\" The official said that the administration will leverage all available resources and, with the help of Congress would \"continue to invest increasing amounts for the success of the mission.\"",
      "\"I think we will see unbelievable advancements in health sciences, so many diseases today that are unfortunate death sentences,\" one of the officials on the call said. \"We're going to understand the exact chemistry and biology that they are and how to combat that. We've seen progress with that relatively significant progress the last five years. It's nothing compared to what we're going to see in the next five years.\"",

    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

      "\"When I heard the noise Adam was making I sat bolt upright in bed, as I previously worked as a carer and it hit me that it was the same noise I've heard when people are taking their final breaths,\" said Hannah, 33.",
      "She immediately sprang into action, calling an ambulance and performing CPR on her husband until paramedics arrived to whisk him to the hospital. On the way, they shocked Adam seven times with a defibrillator before his heart rate normalized.",
      "Adam woke up at the hospital six days later and learned that he had been diagnosed with a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, which prevents the heart from pumping blood around the body effectively.",
      "After weeks of recovery and a procedure to have a Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator put in his chest, Adam was finally allowed to go home \u2014 where he was reunited with Polly.",
      "\"When I got out of hospital, I'll never forget seeing Polly again and knowing how she had intervened that night. I just cuddled her and cried for 20 minutes,\" Adam said.",
      "The couple credit Polly with having saved Adam's life by being \"in tune\" with him, and they believe she even knew what was happening.",
      "\"Polly alerted me, possibly within seconds of Adam's cardiac arrest, she was the first responder,\" Hannah told the BHF, a charity that raises awareness of cardiovascular disease and money to fund research into treatments and cures. \"Because of her, I was able to start CPR almost immediately.\"",
      "Hannah and Polly were set to receive their honors as \"CPR Heroes\" at the BHF's Heart Hero Awards ceremony in London on Tuesday evening.",

    "summary": "Four more people were arrested in the probe into the spectacular daylight heist of imperial jewels from the Louvre Museum, French authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "Four more people were arrested Tuesday in the investigation into last month's spectacular daylight heist of imperial jewels from the Louvre Museum, French authorities announced.",
      "Paris prosecutor  Laure Beccuau, whose office is heading the investigation, described the suspects as two men aged 38 and 39 and two women aged 31 and 40 from the Paris region.",
      "Her statement didn't say what role they're suspected of having played in the Oct. 19 theft. Police can hold them for questioning for 96 hours.",
      "The loot, valued at around $102 million, hasn't been recovered. It includes a diamond-and-emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels tied to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense, and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's pearl-and-diamond tiara.",
      "The thieves dropped a diamond-and-emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Eug\u00e9nie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.",
      "A police dragnet has previously caught other suspected members of the four-person team thought to have carried out the daring robbery. Investigating magistrates have filed preliminary charges against three men and one woman who were arrested last month.",
      "The heist unfolded when the Louvre, the world's most-visited art museum, was raided in broad daylight. The gang took just seven minutes to steal the jewels before fleeing on scooters.",
      "The thieves parked a moving truck with a ladder below the museum's Apollo Gallery housing the jewels, ascended in a bucket, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures.",
      "One of the men already charged in the heist, a 37-year-old, was in a relationship with the woman and they have children, Beccuau said earlier this month. The couple were arrested after their DNA was found in the basket lift used during the robbery. The man's criminal record contained 11 previous convictions, most of them for theft, she said.",
      "The first two men arrested earlier were also known to the police for having committed thefts. Both lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.",
      "Last week, Louvre director Laurence des Cars revealed some new details about the security breach, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said Wednesday while telling lawmakers that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 million visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people have visited the Louvre.",

    "summary": "A push by the Trump administration to end Russia's war on Ukraine appears to make headway, with Kyiv saying Zelenskyy could visit D.C. within days to finalize a deal.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to Washington before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Tuesday morning. \"There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Umerov\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0on Tuesday that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Mr. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

    "story": [
      "Jige Mughalgai, Afghanistan \u2014\u00a0Afghanistan's Taliban government vowed Tuesday to \"respond appropriately\" to overnight border strikes it blamed on Pakistan that killed 10 people, as tension between the neighbors soared following a suicide bombing in Peshawar a day earlier.",
      "\"The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a social media post. \"As a result, nine children (five boys and four girls) and one woman were martyred\" in Khost province.",
      "Mujahid said Pakistani airstrikes targeting the border regions of Kunar and Paktika wounded another four civilians.",
      "The raids were carried out by drones and aircraft, according to Mustaghfir Gurbuz, a spokesman for the governor of Khost.",
      "In Jige Mughalgai, near the border with Pakistan, an AFP correspondent saw residents searching through the rubble of a collapsed house and preparing graves for victims.",
      "\"The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns this violation and reiterates that defending its airspace, territory, and people is its legitimate right, and it will respond appropriately at the right time,\" Mujahid said in a separate statement.",
      "The Pakistani military did not comment on the strikes when contacted by AFP, but before the attacks, the country's Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said in a television interview that the people behind the deadly suicide attack in Peshawar on Monday had come from Afghanistan.",
      "\"These are the same long-range attacks from Afghanistan about which they used to say they will go as far as Islamabad,\" claimed Chaudhry, without offering any specific evidence. \"There are more than 36 terrorist groups in Afghanistan. These terrorists are Indian proxies.\"",
      "The suicide attack targeted the headquarters of Pakistan's paramilitary Federal Constabulary force in Peshawar, killing three officers and wounding 11 others.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility, but Pakistani state broadcaster PTV reported the attackers were Afghan nationals and said President Asif Zardari blamed the \"foreign-backed Fitna al-Khawarij\" \u2014 Islamabad's term for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, or the Pakistani Taliban) militants it accuses of operating from Afghan soil.",
      "Another suicide blast outside a court in the Pakistan capital Islamabad this month killed 12 people and was claimed by a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which shares the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban but insists it operates independently.",
      "Islamabad blamed a militant cell which was \"guided at every step by the ... high command based in Afghanistan\" for the capital attack.",
      "In a message sent to CBS News' Sami Yousafzai on Tuesday, Amir Mohmand, a TTP commander in a Pakistani region right on the Afghan border, said Pakistan's military strikes on Afghanistan were based on a \"misperception.\"",
      "\"Pakistan is bombing Afghanistan because they think it will stop us ( TTP) from our jihadi struggle against the puppet regime in Islamabad,\" he said. \"The [Afghan] Taliban came to power in 2021. We have been running our struggle since 2006, and even before 1994. The Afghan Taliban may have sympathies on the ground level, but we are independent. No one can define the start or stop of our holy struggle.\"",
      "Mohamand claimed a new wave of suicide bombers had recently completed training and were prepared to carry out additional attacks inside Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan has long accused the Taliban, and India, of covertly backing the TTP's violence, and government Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday showed a video of an alleged confession by one of the purported suspects in the Peshawar attack, claiming \"clear-cut evidence that TTA [Afghan Taliban] and TTP did it together, and the suicide bomber was a resident of Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan is fully involved ... and their soil is also involved. The people being sheltered there are also involved,\" he said on live television, without mentioning the military's strikes in the neighboring country.",
      "The flare-up of cross-border tension is just the latest challenge to a tenuous ceasefire agreement between the neighbors that came into effect in mid-October, and relations between Islamabad and Kabul have been fraught since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021.",
      "Deadly border clashes in early October killed around 70 people on both sides \u2014 violence that the ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey was intended to halt, but several rounds of talks in Doha and Istanbul failed to produce a lasting agreement, and security issues, especially Pakistan's demand that Kabul go after TTP fighters, have proven to be a sticking point.",
      "Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militants behind a surge in attacks, including the TTP, which has waged a bloody campaign against Pakistan for years. Kabul denies the charge and counters that Pakistan harbors groups hostile to Afghanistan and does not respect its sovereignty.",

    "summary": "Every 10 minutes a woman somewhere in the world was killed by intimate partners or family members in 2024, according to a U.N. report.",
    "story": [
      "Every 10 minutes last year a woman somewhere in the world was killed by a person close to her, the United Nations said Monday as it decried a lack of progress in the battle against femicide.",
      "Some 50,000 women and girls were killed by intimate partners or family members in 2024, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Women said in a report released to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.",
      "The report found that 83,000 women and girls were intentionally killed in 2024. Sixty percent of those women were murdered by partners or relatives such as fathers, uncles, mothers and brothers, the report said.",
      "For comparison, 11% of male murder victims were killed by someone close to them, though about 80% of all homicide victims in 2024 were men, according to the report.",
      "The 50,000 figure \u2014 based on data from 117 countries \u2014 breaks down to 137 women per day, or around one woman every 10 minutes, the report said.",
      "\"The home remains a dangerous and sometimes lethal place for too many women and girls around the world,\" said John Brandolino, acting Executive Director of UNODC, in a news release announcing the report.",
      "The total is slightly lower than the figure reported in 2023, thought it does not indicate an actual decrease, according to the report, as it stems largely from differences in data availability from country to country.",
      "No region of the world went without femicide cases committed by partners or family members. The highest rate was recorded in Africa, with 3 such cases per 100,000 women, followed by the Americas, which saw 1.5 such cases per 100,000 women. Oceania saw 1.4 cases per 100,000 women, Asia had 0.7, and Europe recorded 0.5, according to the report.",
      "\"Femicides don't happen in isolation. They often sit on a continuum of violence that can start with controlling behavior, threats, and harassment \u2014 including online,\" Sarah Hendricks, Director of UN Women's Policy Division, said in a statement.",
      "The report said technological development has exacerbated some kinds of violence against women and girls and created others, such as non-consensual image-sharing, doxxing, and deepfake videos.",
      "\"We need the implementation of laws that recognize how violence manifests across the lives of women and girls, both online and offline, and hold perpetrators to account well before it turns deadly,\" said Hendricks.",

      "The dead climbers' bodies have been found and specialist searchers were working to recover them \"in a challenging alpine environment,\" Police Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said. None of the climbers has been publicly identified, but the New Zealand Mountain Guides Association said in a statement that one of those who died was a member of their organization and the other was that guide's client.",
      "Sgt. Kevin McErlain told The Timaru Herald the pair had been connected by a rope when they fell near the summit of Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook.",
      "The authorities learned late Monday night local time that four climbers needed help on the mountain, which is on New Zealand's South Island. Two of the climbers were rescued by helicopter in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Walker said.",
      "They were uninjured. Searchers in two helicopters looked throughout the night for the other climbers, who were found dead hours later.",
      "Aoraki is 12,218 feet high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",
      "The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.",
      "More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.",
      "This includes three men, two from the United States and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans - Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California - were certified alpine guides.",
      "The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.",
      "The two climbers' deaths in New Zealand follow a series of other deaths on some of the world's most tallest and most famous peaks in recent months.",
      "Earlier this month, an avalanche swept through a camp on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal and killed five foreign climbers and two guides\u00a0at an altitude of 16,070 feet.",

    "summary": "As U.S. and European officials tout progress in Ukraine peace talks, Zelenskyy says a key sticking point is letting Putin keep \"what he has stolen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that the suggested legal recognition of Russian sovereignty over captured territory in the east of his country remained a \"main problem\" in negotiations as President Trump pushes for a deal to end Moscow's nearly-four-year war on Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian and American officials met over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss a 28-point proposal floated last week by the White House. They discussed the possibility of Zelenskyy visiting the U.S. this week as part of Mr. Trump's bid to get an agreement by Thanksgiving, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported, citing multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the Thanksgiving deadline as flexible, and he told reporters Saturday that the plan presented last week was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Geneva for the weekend talks, said \"very, very meaningful\" progress was made with the Ukrainian and European delegations, but that \"there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Addressing Sweden's parliament on Monday, Zelenskyy made it clear one of the key points of contention over the U.S. proposal was a call for Ukraine and the global community to formally recognize some portion of the ground Russian forces have occupied by force as no longer Ukrainian.",
      "\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's the main problem. You all understand what that means.\"",
      "Finland's President Alexander Stubb said there were still \"major issues which remain to be resolved\" regarding the U.S. peace proposal, though he also welcomed progress made during the high-stakes talks in Geneva.",
      "Rubio struck a more optimistic tone in describing the weekend talks, saying Sunday that the session in Geneval was \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue\" since President Trump came back into office for his second term in January.",
      "Rubio stressed that there was more work to do and said he didn't want to \"declare victory or finality.\"",
      "The top U.S. diplomat was pressed by reporters but would not offer any insight into which issues were the main sticking points in the peace talks. He called the proposal a \"living, breathing document\" and said he believed the issues that remained unsettled were \"not insurmountable.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions, but Russia's government said Monday that the revisions had not been shared, and that it would reserve judgement.",
      "Putin said Friday that the U.S. proposal could serve as the basis of a negotiated resolution to what his government has refused to acknowledge as a war, but he warned that if Ukraine turned down the plan, Russian forces would remain on the attack, seizing yet more ground.",
      "\"We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been pouring in from Geneva over the past few days,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, \"but we have not yet received anything official.\"",
      "\"We read a statement that, following the discussions in Geneva, some amendments had been made to the text which we had seen earlier. We will wait. It seems that the dialogue is continuing,\" he said, adding that there were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and U.S. officials on the topic, but that Moscow remained open to dialogue.",
      "The 28-point plan, which U.S. officials said last week had Mr. Trump's backing, sparked alarm among America's European allies for being perceived as too favorable to Russia.",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all of the terms in the draft plan, which was leaked to media outlets last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

      "The 18-carat gold watch was gifted to its original owner, Isidor Straus, by his wife, Ida Straus, for his 43rd birthday, said Henry Aldridge and Son, the auction house that sold it on Saturday. It was recovered from his body after the Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic in April 1912.",

But Isidor Straus refused his seat, instead insisting that it should have been offered to younger men, and Ida Straus followed him, reportedly saying, \"Where you go, I go.\"",
      "According to those archives, Isidor and Ida Straus were last seen standing arm in arm on the deck of the Titanic, before a wave crashed overhead and washed them out to sea. The Strauses were the ancestors of Wendy Rush, wife of OceanGate founder Stockton Rush, who died in the infamous Titan submersible explosion in 2023 en route to the Titanic wreck site.",
      "Straus' pocket watch exceeded the previous record sale for a piece of the Titanic's history memorabilia by about $300,000, according to Henry Aldridge and Son. The previous record was set for another gold pocket watch, which sold an auction last year for about $1.97 million. It had been gifted by Titanic survivors to the captain of the RMS Carpathia, who steered his ship toward the Titanic wreck on the night it sunk and ultimately rescued hundreds of passengers still afloat on life boats, according to the auction house.",

    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "However, the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have been blamed for similar previous assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in militant attacks. The TPP is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban that leads Afghanistan.",

      "The attacks have strained ties between Islamabad and Afghanistan's Taliban government, with Pakistan accusing the Pakistani Taliban of operating freely inside Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in 2021.",
      "Pakistan's government often accuses Afghanistan of turning a blind eye to cross-border attacks by militants.",
      "Kabul denies the allegation, but tensions between the two sides escalated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for Oct. 9 drone strikes in Kabul and vowed retaliation. The ensuing fighting killed dozens of people, including soldiers, civilians and militants, before Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains in place.",

    "summary": "Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society,\" the Seoul Central District Court said.",
    "story": [
      "A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said the severity of Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society.\" It sentenced 10 accomplices to prison terms ranging from two to four years in what law enforcement authorities describe as the country's largest cybersex crime case to date.",
      "He was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms, BBC News reported. Calling himself the \"pastor\" of the group, Kim targeted both male and female victims, according to the BBC News.",
      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",
      "Kim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims' family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said, per BBC News. \"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",
      "\"Most of the victims were children or adolescents, and it appears they would have suffered extreme physical and psychological pain as a result of the crimes,\" the court said in a statement.",
      "\"Digital sex crimes can rapidly amplify the damages of the victims to an irreparable level in the digital space, and once sexually exploitative materials are distributed, it's physically very difficult to completely remove them, making recovery from damage practically impossible.\"",
      "The revelation of Kim's crimes following his January arrest triggered public shock and concern over the growing risk of sexual violence enabled by digital technologies. Monday's ruling came almost five years after the same court issued a 40-year prison term for Cho Ju-bin on charges of blackmailing dozens of women, including minors, into filming sexually explicit videos and selling them to others.",

    "summary": "A family feud surrounding Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his sister has been intensifying. It involves political alignments and now, drug abuse charges.",
    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. refused to respond on Monday to an allegation by his estranged sister, a senator, that he has been a longtime drug addict whose cocaine dependence has undermined his governance, saying with a somber tone that he didn't want to discuss a family rift in public.",
      "That split has been growing since Imee Marcos publicly aligned with his political arch rival, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of midterm elections in May. Sara Duterte is the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, Ferdinand Maros Jr.'s harsh critic and predecessor.",
      "Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro has said that Sen. Imee Marcos' accusations against her own brother before a huge religious rally in Manila last week were \"a web of lies\" and may have been a desperate attempt to distract from ongoing investigations into a corruption scandal that may implicate her opposition allies in the Senate.",
      "Aides have said in the past that Marcos Jr. had tested negative for cocaine and methamphetamine. When asked to respond to his elder sister's allegations, the president briefly paused and then said in a televised news conference, \"It's anathema to talk about family matters generally in public. We do not like to show our dirty linen in public.\"",
      "The president suggested that something was troubling her sister. \"The lady that you see talking on TV is not my sister and that view is shared by our cousins, friends, that it's not her,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "\"That's why we are worried, we are very worried about her. I hope she feels better soon,\" the president said. When asked if he plans to talk to her, Marcos said that he and his sister \"no longer travel in the same circles, political or otherwise.\"",
      "Marcos, 68, and his sister are children of then dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., who was overthrown in an army-backed but largely peaceful \"people power\" uprising in 1986 after an authoritarian era that was notorious for human rights and political repression and plunder. The dictator died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. His family returned to the Philippines in 1991 and slowly regained a political foothold.",
      "Marcos Jr. won the presidency in 2022 with a landslide margin in one of the greatest political comebacks in Philippines history.",
      "In a speech Monday night before a huge rally by a religious group in a Manila park, Imee Marcos said her brother's drug addiction allegedly started when their father was still president and has continued to this day. She claimed it has affected his health and ability to govern.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on an International Criminal Court warrant in March and flown to and detained in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drug crackdowns that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. Duterte has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Duterte's family and allies, including Imee Marcos, have blamed Marcos Jr. for what they claim was the ex-president's illegal arrest and detention by the global court.",

      "The man, Johnson Wen, was sent back to Australia and \"has been barred from re-entering Singapore,\" the city-state's immigration authority said in a statement quoted by broadcaster CNA.",
      "Grande and other stars were attending the opening night of the highly anticipated film at Universal Studios in Singapore when 26-year-old Wen jumped a barricade and rushed the actor. He put his arm around Grande.",
      "Viral clips showed Grande's co-star, Cynthia Erivo, rushing to her defense, getting in between the two of them and shoving him away. Wen was then grabbed by security guards and dumped back over the barricade.",
      "Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "Wen was arrested hours later and charged with \"being a public nuisance.\" Last week, a court sentenced him to nine days in jail.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared a video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",
      "Singapore District Judge Christopher Goh, who issued the jail sentence, called the Australian \"attention seeking.\"",
      "Wen, who is alleged to have disrupted other global sports events and concerts, \"showed a pattern of behaviour\" which suggested that he will do it again, the judge had said before last week's ruling. The jail term was far below the maximum penalty afforded by law: three months in jail, a fine of $1,500, or both.",
      "Wen has told the court he was \"wrong\" to think his actions would bear no consequences and promised not to repeat the act.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\"\u00a0was released in the United States on Friday.",
      "Grande and Erivo have been inseparable during the movie musical's press tours. In December 2024, Erivo told \"CBS Mornings\" that the duo\u00a0made a pact early in production\u00a0to take care of and support each other.",
      "\"Before we started shooting, both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal\u00a0brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal\u00a0have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.",
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-alleged-hybrid-warfare-undersea-cables/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

      "The far-left push within the Democratic Party, highlighted by mayoral victories by socialist candidates in New York City and Seattle, is poised to be a major factor in several key battleground House races as several candidates carrying the progressive mantle hold strong positions in Democratic primaries.",
      "Several of the most competitive House races in the country feature candidates putting to the test whether progressive policies can appeal to voters outside deep blue urban centers, including in California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District, where Democrat Randy Villegas is running to unseat Republican Rep. David Valadao.",
      "\"Bernie and I share the same goal: to make life more affordable for working families,\" Villegas said in a statement after being endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described \"democratic socialist.\"",
      "\"He has dedicated his life to putting power in the hands of ordinary Americans instead of the ultra-rich, and I\u2019m excited to work together to fight for our communities here in the Central Valley and across the country.\"",

      "\"Here in the Central Valley, we couldn't care less about political labels,\" Villegas said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We care about being able to see a doctor without going bankrupt and being able to feed our families without needing a second job. We're sick of politicians in both parties selling us out to billionaires and corporations. Any politician who isn't fighting for working families like our lives depends on it needs to get out of the way.\"",

      "While Washington pushes proposals aimed at easing Russia\u2019s terms for a cease-fire with Ukraine in Europe, it\u2019s taking a far tougher stance in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 moving to label Venezuela\u2019s military-linked Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization and quietly expanding its military footprint in the Caribbean.",
      "Sporadic strikes on alleged cartel boats off Venezuela\u2019s coast have grown into the largest U.S. military presence in Southern Command\u2019s area in a generation, with the world\u2019s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, steaming toward the Caribbean Sea. President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela \u2014 operations that often precede military force \u2014 and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to The New York Times.",

      "At the same time, a top Russian commander, Colonel General Oleg Makarevich, has been reassigned from the Ukrainian front to head Russia\u2019s Equator Task Force in Venezuela, overseeing roughly 120 troops training Venezuelan forces, Ukrainian intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told The War Zone. Fox News Digital has not independently verified Budanov\u2019s claim.",
      "Seth Krummrich, a retired U.S. Army colonel and vice president at Global Guardian, said Russian military advisers are indeed operating inside Venezuela but doubted Moscow would back Maduro militarily. \"They\u2019re there, full stop,\" Krummrich said. \"But Russia needs to stop the massive blood-letting of its young men in Ukraine. They\u2019re not going to go toe-to-toe with us militarily.\" He added that the relationship is long-standing: \"There is a long history of Russian military advisers in Cuba and in Venezuela that goes on for decades.\"",
      "Many in Washington see a strategic payoff in forcing out Maduro: it would strip Russia of its last firm foothold in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 a loss comparable, in some analysts\u2019 view, to Moscow\u2019s waning influence in Syria. \"Venezuela, for the longest time, has been a launch pad for Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence in the Western Hemisphere,\" Krummrich said. \"These chess pieces are all tied together when you arch your great-power competition.\"",
      "Other experts caution against assuming the U.S. escalation in Venezuela and its peace overtures in Europe are part of a single coordinated plan. Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), spoke with Fox News Digital and said any overlap may be more coincidence than strategy.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been zigging and zagging in Venezuela,\" Berg said. \"Trump has gone back and forth between build-ups and calls for dialogue, while the Russia timeline has only recently become parallel to these events. Anything that looks coordinated is likely coincidence.\"",
      "Berg recalled that during Trump\u2019s first administration, some advisers floated an \"Ukraine-for-Venezuela\" concept \u2014 asking Russia to relinquish its stake in Caracas in exchange for U.S. concessions in Eastern Europe \u2014 but the idea was quickly abandoned. \"Russian power in Venezuela is important,\" Berg said, \"but it\u2019s not so overwhelming that it\u2019s the reason Maduro survives.\"",
      "HOW TRUMP\u2019S STRIKES AGAINST ALLEGED NARCO-TERRORISTS ARE RESHAPING THE CARTEL BATTLEFIELD: 'ONE-WAY TICKET'",
      "Russia\u2019s footprint in Latin America has grown only modestly since the early 2000s, dwarfed by China\u2019s economic expansion. Moscow\u2019s closest partners remain Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Beyond them, its influence is exercised mainly through media and selective economic pressure.",
      "\"If you look at Russia\u2019s trade profile with the region, it\u2019s small,\" Berg said. \"But Moscow is very good at using those few trade points for leverage.\"",
      "Russia continues to service aging equipment across the region. \"They sell a lot of kit here,\" Berg added. \"Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency.\" (Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)",
      "He cited examples: when Ecuador considered sending old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for U.S. military aid, Russia threatened to block Ecuadorian banana exports \u2014 nearly $1 billion annually \u2014 by imposing new phytosanitary checks. The deal collapsed within a week.",
      "Similarly, Moscow has kept Brazil and Argentina largely muted on the Ukraine invasion by leveraging its control over nitrate fertilizer exports, crucial to both agricultural giants. \"They use whatever levers they have \u2014 bananas, fertilizer, spare parts \u2014 to coerce quietly,\" Berg said.",
      "Russia also continues to service aging equipment across the region. \"They sell a lot of kit here,\" Berg added. \"Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency.\"",
      "If U.S. forces strike Venezuelan targets, most observers expect Russia to limit its response to intelligence sharing and disinformation, not combat support. \"The Russians are pretty tied down in Ukraine,\" Berg said. \"We saw during the 12-day war, when Iran appealed for help, Moscow stayed silent. They simply don\u2019t have the capacity.\"",
      "Berg described a recent episode in which a sanctioned Ilyushin cargo plane landed in Caracas. Russian lawmakers briefly claimed it carried air-defense systems and technicians to assist Maduro, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later denied it. \"He essentially said, \u2018We have no mutual-defense treaty,\u2019\" Berg noted. \"That was widely read as: we\u2019re not coming to Venezuela.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela \u2014 operations that often precede military force \u2014 and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to the New York Times. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)",
      "John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, also spoke with Fox News Digital and said there is little evidence of a coordinated link between the U.S. buildup in the Caribbean and Washington\u2019s peace overtures in Europe. \"I don\u2019t see any immediate connection,\" Hardie said. \"Russia\u2019s ability to influence events in Venezuela is pretty limited.\"",
      "He said Moscow\u2019s power-projection capacity in the Western Hemisphere remains constrained. \"They can take limited action \u2014 fly some bombers into the region, sail submarines to Cuba \u2014 but major operations in Latin America are beyond their capacity,\" Hardie said.",
      "Hardie also noted reports of the Russian Ilyushin transport aircraft visiting Venezuela and suggestions it could have carried air-defense systems, but said any such transfer would have little strategic effect. \"Even if Russia slipped in some air defenses, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference,\" he said. \"The Venezuelan military would still be heavily overmatched by the United States.\"",
      "Both Krummrich and Berg agree that momentum is building toward U.S. kinetic action. Berg said indications point to possible strikes between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as U.S. naval and intelligence assets align and Trump signals impatience with Maduro\u2019s attempts to stall.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Maduro\u2019s instinct is to buy time \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s kept him afloat through multiple administrations,\" Berg said. \"But Trump wants results, not a two-year transition or vague promises about U.S. oil access. The question is what Maduro can offer that will actually satisfy him.\"",
      "Whether this two-track moment represents coincidence or coordination, the stakes are high. A peace framework in Europe could stabilize one front while a new flashpoint ignites closer to home \u2014 underscoring the paradox of Washington\u2019s posture in late 2025: seeking de-escalation abroad while bracing for confrontation in its own hemisphere."

      "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump-aligned lawfare group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller is petitioning two of the government's top federal health agencies to immediately repeal a Biden-era regulation they claim promotes organ transplantation allocation based on race, not medical need.",
      "Initially, the proposed rule from the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had an equity performance adjustment, but that part of the rule was scrapped before it was finalized.",
      "The Increasing Organ Transplant Access (IOTA) Model in question scores selected hospitals, which are required to participate, across three domains as it relates to kidney organ transplantation: achievement, efficiency and quality. Based on the scores, hospitals will either get money for their efforts, owe money back to the federal government for not meeting expectations, or neither receive nor owe anything.",
      "Rather than an explicit score adjustment, the rule's equity agenda was embedded more subtly through a \"voluntary\" health equity plan that mandatory participating hospitals are encouraged to complete. The plan pushes hospitals to identify \"health disparities\" and identify \"equity goals to monitor and evaluate progress in reducing targeted health disparities,\" which will be measured by \"one or more quantitative metrics that the IOTA participant uses to measure the reductions in target health disparities arising from the health equity plan interventions.\"",

      "The six-year mandatory payment program builds on earlier payment experiments, testing whether financial rewards and penalties can improve care and expand access for Medicare and Medicaid patients. The rule was published in the Federal Register on Dec. 4, and began operating on July 1,",
      "Meanwhile, according to AFL, 67 of the 103 hospitals mandated to participate in the IOTA Model are \"still engaging\" in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.

The order also required federal agencies to develop an action plan to address those barriers.",
      "As part of this effort, in December 2021, CMS issued a request to the public for comments on how the agency could \"Advance Equity and Reduce Disparities in Organ Transplantation.\"",
      "\"CMS is focused on identifying potential system-wide improvements that would increase organ donations, improve transplants, enhance the quality of care in dialysis facilities, increase access to dialysis services, and advance equity in organ donation and transplantation,\" the agency said at the time. \"Black Americans are almost four times more likely, and Latinos are 1.3 times more likely, to have kidney failure compared to White Americans. Despite the higher risk, data shows that Black and Latino patients on dialysis are less likely to be placed on the transplant waitlist and have a lower likelihood of transplantation. Because of these stark inequities, CMS\u2019 [Request For Information] asks the public for specific ideas on advancing equity within the organ transplantation system.\"",

In July, HHS released a statement announcing an initiative to reform the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), following a federal investigation that found \"disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "AFL argues that the IOTA Model final rule, specifically, violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the equal protection clause, precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court, and executive orders issued by President Donald Trump.",

      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",

      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",

      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

      "Digital ID stores your passport information securely on your device. Your data stays encrypted at all times. Apple cannot see where or when you use your Digital ID.",
      "Apple\u2019s new Digital ID lets you store a passport on your iPhone for faster TSA checks. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",
      "When you present your Digital ID, you choose what information the TSA can see. You review the request on your screen and confirm it with Face ID or Touch ID. This helps prevent situations where someone else could access your ID without your approval.",
      "APPLE PASSKEY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMS MAC SECURITY WITH BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTED STORAGE",
      "Where Digital ID works",
      "Digital ID works for identity checks at select TSA lanes during domestic travel. It does not work for international flights or border crossings. Apple says support will expand to certain hotels, stores and online services where age or ID checks are needed.",
      "Eligibility requirements for Apple Digital ID",
      "Before you add a Digital ID to Apple Wallet, you need to meet a few basic requirements. To start, you must have a valid, unexpired U.S. passport. You also need an iPhone 11 or later with iOS 26.1 or later.",
      "If your iPhone is not up-to-date, you can install iOS 26.1 by opening Settings, tapping General, choosing Software Update and following the on-screen steps. Make sure your phone is charged and connected to Wi-Fi before you start the update.",
      "Digital ID in Wallet works only at select TSA checkpoints for domestic travel. It cannot replace a physical passport. Because of that, you should still bring your physical passport or license in case TSA needs to review it. You must also carry your physical passport for any international travel or border crossing.",

      "Archer Aviation plans to use the airport as the main operational hub for its LA air taxi network. The company also plans to prepare the site to support transportation during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This includes managing everything from takeoff scheduling to ground operations. In its shareholder letter, Archer frames Hawthorne as a \"plug-and-play\" anchor hub for its LA28 Olympic plans, saying it expects to ramp up aircraft testing, storage, maintenance and charging on-site as it prepares for commercial service.",
      "The airport will also become a test bed for next-generation AI-powered aviation systems. These tools will help Archer develop smarter air traffic management, faster turnaround times and safer operations in crowded airspace.",
      "Archer outlines a two-phase plan in the letter. Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",

      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",

      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",

      "What this means for you",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

    "summary": "Fake AI apps disguised as &quot;ChatGPT&quot; and &quot;DALL\u00b7E&quot; are flooding app stores with dangerous malware that steals data and monitors users without detection.",
    "story": [
      "\u2018The CyberGuy\u2019 Kurt Knutsson joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss the potential effects of artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT on the brain.",
      "App stores are supposed to be reliable and free of malware or fake apps, but that's far from the truth. For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones. They pose as popular apps like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E, but in reality, they conceal sophisticated spyware capable of stealing data and monitoring users.",

      "OPENAI ACCUSES NY TIMES OF WANTING TO INVADE MILLIONS OF USERS' PRIVACY IN PAPER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST TECH GIANT",
      "Fake AI apps pose as trusted tools like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E while secretly stealing user data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",
      "These impostors harm both users and brands, leading to costly data breaches and lost trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps to protect yourself from fake AI apps",
      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The AI boom has driven massive innovation, but it has also opened new attack surfaces built on brand trust. As adoption grows across mobile platforms, enterprises must secure not only their own apps but also track how their brand appears across hundreds of app stores worldwide. In a market where billions of AI app downloads have happened, the clones aren't coming. They're already here, hiding behind familiar logos and polished interfaces.",

      "A new Play Store update makes it easier to manage apps across all your Android devices. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The new uninstall button rolls out",
      "Google is rolling out version 48.8 of the Play Store, and it introduces a new \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button right on each app's listing. You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one. According to Android Authority and other reliable tech outlets, this feature appears beside each Android device listed under your account, making it faster to keep your devices organized and clutter-free.",
      "The update replaces the older process that required navigating through \u2018Profile,\u2019 then \u2018Manage Apps and Devices,\u2019 then applying a device filter before uninstalling. That long-winded method still works, but the new shortcut saves time and effort. The feature is rolling out gradually, so you might not see it right away, but it should appear soon as part of the stable update.",
      "Why this update matters",
      "For anyone juggling a phone, tablet or even a work device, this new feature makes a real difference. Over time, unused apps pile up, taking up storage space and slowing down performance. Being able to remove them remotely helps keep every device clean and efficient without switching between screens.",
      "The change also improves digital hygiene. Many people forget about apps on old phones that still have access to personal data or permissions.

      "If confirmed, Phippsaksla would join a long list of meteorites identified by earlier missions, including Curiosity\u2019s \"Lebanon\" and \"Cacao\" finds, as well as metallic fragments spotted by Opportunity and Spirit. NASA said each discovery has helped scientists better understand how meteorites interact with the Martian surface over time.",

      "The holiday season is the happiest and riskiest time of year to be online. As millions of us gear up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, scammers do the same.",
      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you. Those profiles are exactly what scammers use to send realistic \"order confirmations,\" fake delivery alerts and \"urgent payment\" texts during this holiday period and beyond.",

      "November through December is a goldmine for cybercriminals. According to the CISA, reports of online shopping scams spike during this time of year and vary in their approaches. The reason? We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "THE TRUTH BEHIND THOSE MYSTERIOUS SHIPMENT EMAILS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",

    "story": [
      "Middle Georgia State University is one of only nine schools offering the FAA\u2019s Enhanced AT-CTI program, a faster pathway that prepares students for air traffic control jobs amid a national staffing shortage.",
      "Eastman, GA \u2013 A nationwide air traffic controller shortage has put new attention on a growing training option the FAA now approves for certain colleges.",
      "The recent federal government shutdown highlighted how thin staffing has become, especially as delays and reroutes stacked up across the country.",
      "The FAA says it wants to hire at least 8,900 new controllers by 2028. According to FAA workforce data analyzed by USAFacts, about 3,000 controller positions were vacant nationwide as of late 2024 \u2014 though not every facility is equally understaffed.",
      "That shortage is driving interest in a newer FAA-approved college pathway designed to streamline controller training at a small group of universities \u2014 including Middle Georgia State.",

      "Training ramps up in difficulty as students learn to manage more aircraft at once on radar. (Fox News)",
      "The Enhanced AT-CTI program allows students to train to the same standard as the FAA Academy, and if hired and meeting FAA requirements such as passing the Air Traffic Skills Assessment (ATSA), medical and security clearances, they can go directly to a facility instead of completing the full academy in Oklahoma City, which can involve long waitlists and multi-month courses.",
      "Graduates still undergo facility-specific training and must be certified on-the-job before becoming full controllers.",
      "Only about nine schools nationwide have been approved to offer the new Enhanced AT-CTI program as of 2025, according to Kemarie Jeffers, the department chair of aviation science and management at Middle Georgia State.",
      "Inside Middle Georgia State\u2019s tower simulator, air traffic control student Brooke Graffagnino says the job\u2019s intensity is what drew her in. \"It kind of gets your chest beating, because with how much traffic there is, sometimes it is intense,\" she said.",

      "Graffagnino says the importance of the work became clearer as she learned how controllers keep busy airspace organized. \"Once you get in the airspace that is super crowded or approaching the larger airports like Atlanta, you need someone to help coordinate and keep everything separate and safe,\" she said.",
      "Middle Georgia State was approved as an Enhanced AT-CTI school in mid-2024. Jeffers says the impact was immediate.",
      "\"Before our program had maybe about 17 to 20 students. Right now we have 54. So we have already, in that short amount of time, almost tripled in size the amount of students that we have,\" he said.",
      "An instructor helps a student navigate radar-based air traffic training during an advanced simulation. (Fox News)",
      "To earn the enhanced designation, Jeffers said the school had to update its curriculum, overhaul parts of its simulator setup, and install new audio and video systems.",
      "\"We\u2019ve upgraded a lot of our equipment\u2026 we had to install audio and video equipment upstairs in our tower sim,\" he said.",
      "Those upgrades allow the FAA to remotely review or spot-check training sessions and ensure they meet federal standards.",
      "FAA TO LIFT EMERGENCY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS MONDAY MORNING AS AIR TRAFFIC STAFFING REBOUNDS",
      "The program\u2019s biggest distinction is what happens after graduation. \"Enhanced CTI eliminates your requirement of going to the academy. You will graduate here and you can go straight to work,\" Jeffers said. \"So it saves you time and effort \u2014 again, it gets you to work sooner and making money quicker.\"",
      "The FAA requires enhanced programs to employ instructors with controller experience and maintain simulator equipment comparable to FAA standards.",

      "According to the FAA\u2019s FY 2025 Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the agency anticipates about 2,000 hires in FY 2025, 2,200 in FY 2026, and incremental increases through 2028, though retirements are expected to offset much of that growth.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

    "summary": "As we age, the human brain rewires itself.",
    "story": [
      "As we age, the human brain rewires itself.",
      "The process happens in distinct phases, or \u201cepochs,\u201d according to new research, as the structure of our neural networks changes and our brains reconfigure how we think and process information.",
      "For the first time, scientists say they\u2019ve identified four distinct turning points between those phases in an average brain: at ages 9, 32, 66 and 83. During each epoch between those years, our brains show markedly different characteristics in brain architecture, they say.",
      "The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, suggest that human cognition does not simply increase with age until a peak, then decline. In fact, the phase from ages 9 to 32 is the only time in life when our neural networks are becoming increasingly efficient, according to the research.",
      "During the adulthood phase, from 32 to 66, the average person\u2019s brain architecture essentially stabilizes without major changes, at a time when researchers think people are generally plateauing in intelligence and personality.",
      "And in the years after the last turning point \u2014 83 and beyond \u2014 the brain becomes increasingly reliant on individual regions as connections between them begin to wither away.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a linear progression,\u201d said Alexa Mousley, a postdoctoral researcher associate at the University of Cambridge, who is the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThis is the first step of understanding the way the brain\u2019s changing fluctuates based on age.\u201d",
      "The findings could help identify why mental health and neurological conditions develop during particular phases of rewiring.",
      "Rick Betzel, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the research, said the findings are intriguing, but more data is needed to support the conclusions. The theories may not hold up to scrutiny over time, he said.",
      "\u201cThey did this really ambitious thing,\u201d Betzel said of the study. \u201cLet\u2019s see where it stands in a few years.\u201d",
      "For their research, Mousley and her colleagues analyzed MRI diffusion scans \u2014 which are essentially images of how water molecules move within the brain \u2014 from about 3,800 people from newborns to age 90. The goal was to map the neural connections across the average person\u2019s brain at different stages in life.",
      "In the brain, the bundles of nerve fibers that transfer signals are encapsulated in fatty tissue called myelin. Think of it like wiring or plumbing. Water molecules diffused in the brain tend to move in the direction of these fibers, rather than across them, meaning researchers can infer where the neural pathways are located.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t crack open skulls \u2026 we rely on non-invasive approaches,\u201d Betzel said of this type of neuroscience research. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to figure out is where these fiber bundles are at.\u201d",
      "Based on the MRI scans, the new study maps the neural network of an average person across a lifespan, determining where connections are strengthening or weakening. The five \u201cepochs\u201d it describes are based on the neural connections the researchers observed.",
      "The first phase is up to age 9, they suggest. The brain rapidly increases in gray and white matter; it prunes extra synapses and restructures itself.",
      "From ages 9 to 32, there is an extended period of rewiring. The brain is defined by rapid communication across the entire brain and efficient connections between different regions.",
      "Most mental health disorders are diagnosed during this time period, Mousely said: \u201cIs there something about this second era of life, as we find it, that could lead people to be more vulnerable to the onset of mental health disorders?\u201d",
      "From 32 to 66, the brain plateaus. It\u2019s still rewiring itself, but less dramatically and more slowly.",
      "Then, from 66 to age of 83, the brain tends toward \u201cmodularity,\u201d where the neural network is divided into highly connected subnetworks with less central integration. At age 83, connectivity declines further.",
      "Betzel said the theory described in the study likely jives with people\u2019s lived experiences with aging and cognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intuitively something we gravitate towards. I have two kids and they\u2019re really young. I think all of the time, \u2018I\u2019m getting out of my toddler era,\u2019\u201d Betzel said. \u201cMaybe the science ends up being there. But are those the exact right ages? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "In the ideal version of a study like this, he added, the researchers would have MRI diffusion data for a large group of people, each of whom were scanned during every year of life from birth to death. But that wasn\u2019t possible because the technology wasn\u2019t available decades ago.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon launching a new federal effort to supercharge American artificial intelligence research, development and scientific applications.",
      "Unveiling the new \u201cGenesis Mission\u201d to support American efforts on AI, the order charts out a series of steps to expand computational resources, increase access to vast federal datasets and move toward impactful, real-world applications, particularly in scientific fields.",
      "\u201cThe Genesis Mission will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development,\u201d the order states.",
      "Michael Kratsios, assistant to the president for science and technology and director of the Office for Science and Technology Policy, will lead the effort.",
      "Monday's order describes the Genesis Mission as \"comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project.\"",
      "Among other measures, the order charges Secretary of Energy Chris Wright with establishing a new \u201cAmerican Science and Security Platform\u201d to centralize the infrastructure required for the new push. According to the order, the platform will focus on providing researchers with the computing power and datasets necessary to train AI models.",
      "\u201cThe Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets \u2014 the world\u2019s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments \u2014 to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs,\u201d the order reads.",
      "The order opens the door to significantly increased public-private partnerships on AI development: within 90 days, the secretary of energy must identify systems and data available to support the program, including \u201cresources available through industry partners.\u201d",
      "AI systems require immense datasets in order to learn how to represent the real world. With its vast troves of information about Americans and their activities, the federal government has an enviable, but often decentralized and disorganized, gold mine of data untapped by AI companies to date.",
      "Monday\u2019s order targets these barriers to data-sharing, giving Kratsios the responsibility to integrate \u201cappropriate and available agency data and infrastructure into the Mission.\u201d",
      "With increased computing resources and access to data, AI should then be applied to practical and critical scientific issues within 270 days, the order states. These areas of \u201cscience and technology challenges of national importance\u201d include advanced manufacturing and robotics, biotechnology and nuclear fission and fusion.",
      "Keegan McBride, a senior policy advisor at the Tony Blair Institute and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the announcement was significant.",
      "\u201cAI has the potential to transform the entire scientific, research, and discovery pipeline. This represents a strong signal from the U.S. to the world about what is possible,\u201d McBride told NBC News.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement builds on the existing National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR). The NAIRR was created in 2020 by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 to provide a shared, robust national research infrastructure to \u201caccelerate AI and AI-powered discovery and innovation.\u201d",
      "The NAIRR started as a pilot program, bringing together a coalition of federal agencies, ranging from the Department of Defense and NASA to the National Institutes of Health, and nongovernmental organizations like OpenAI, Google and Palantir, to set up a nationwide research community.",
      "Lynne Parker, who co-chaired the NAIRR task force as deputy chief technology officer of the U.S. under President Joe Biden and is now associate vice chancellor emerita at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said federal support for AI research is pivotal to future progress.",
      "\u201cGovernment support for AI research builds the foundation for new breakthroughs and helps keep innovation aligned with the public interest,\u201d Parker told NBC News. \u201cWe take for granted that new products appear regularly but seldom consider the decades of research that made them possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout long-term investment, we risk ceding leadership in the technologies that will define our economy, our security, and our daily lives,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s AI Action Plan, released in July, emphasized the role of national research and development efforts, partially stemming from the NAIRR, \u201cto foster the next generation of AI breakthroughs.\u201d",
      "Monday\u2019s executive order came weeks after the federal government announced new partnerships with some of America\u2019s leading AI companies to build the next generation of AI-focused supercomputers.",
      "At the end of October, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a new partnership with AMD to launch two new supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, home to some of America\u2019s leading federal AI researchers.",
      "\u201cWinning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,\u201d Secretary Wright said at the time in a statement.",
      "\u201cWorking with AMD and HPE, we\u2019re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together,\u201d Wright said, referencing Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s role in building the supercomputers.",
      "At the beginning of November, the Department of Energy announced further plans to expand Oak Ridge\u2019s Leadership Computer Facility with high-powered Nvidia chips to tackle complex quantum-computing and AI-focused research."

      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

      "Jimmy Cliff, the legendary musician who expanded the popularity of reggae around the world, has died, his family announced Monday on his official Instagram account.",
      "He was 81.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\u201d his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film\u2019s soundtrack was a major international success and did much to spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit aged just 14 with \u201cHurricane Hattie\u201d and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech from Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff from writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d he would have merited inclusion.",
      "A prolific artist well into later life, Cliff collaborated with a string of non-reggae musicians, including the Rolling Stones and Paul Simon, while the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson have recorded versions of his songs.",

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

      "Goldblum has been a staple of the big screen starting from his memorable one-liner in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d back in 1977, to appearing in blockbuster films like \"Independence Day,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
      "Bailey began his career as a stage actor before making headlines as a royal in the Netflix hit \"Bridgerton,\" as well as earning an Emmy nod for his 2023 turn in the series \"Fellow Travelers.\"",
      "Most recently, Bailey joined Goldblum in becoming a \"Jurassic Park\" alum after starring in \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" last summer.",
      "Playing the Wizard of Oz and Prince Fiyero, respectively, Goldblum and Bailey have been traveling the globe for the past couple of weeks promoting \"Wicked: For Good,\" the sequel to last year's box office smash \"Wicked,\" starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda.",
      "During what Bailey and Goldblum mourn as their final joint interview of the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, the two friends banter, ponder plot points (spoilers ahead!) and discuss why the film is exactly the right movie at the right time.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Jonathan Bailey: We were just talking about that.",
      "Jeff Goldblum: We were just talking about that because ...",
      "JB: He lands in the opening sequence of his spinoff (laughing).",
      "JG: The Gregory Maguire books, I think there are seven of them, I think there's a lot of material that probably answers a lot of questions. I was just asking (Maguire) about what happens to Fiyero ... what is that nothingness place? I think it's described in some of those books. What are they going to do?",
      "You saw the movie? Did you get the idea that (Fiyero) is now eternal? Lives forever as a straw person? I have to see it many more times.",
      "JB: (Elphaba and Fiyero) have a family.",
      "JG: They have children ... you were saying. In the books, they have children.",
      "JB: Yes.",
      "JG: There are a bunch of books. And Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard of Oz\") wrote a bunch of books at the beginning of the 1900s, so there's material galore.",
      "JB: I just want a film called \"Wizard\" with Jeff (laughing). But you would play every part like \"Big Momma\u2019s House.\"",
      "JG: I\u2019d like to see \"Momma\u2019s House.\" Or, I'd like to see Fiyero and Elphaba in the \"Dunescape.\"",
      "JB: We'll call it ... \"Making Hay.\" (Laughing)",
      "JG: \"Making Hay,\" excellent. (Laughing)",
      "JB: Making hay, all day and night. (Laughing)",
      "JG: I think, it's very serious. It's like \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" and we cover the next 20 years of their relationship.",
      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/michelle-yeoh-madame-morrible-wicked-for-good-rcna244379",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

      "To try and persuade them to stay, Elphaba sings her new song, \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d \u2014 but to no avail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this extraordinary anthem, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThe animals don\u2019t stay because she can\u2019t convince them, and the truth is they\u2019re probably right to leave. At that moment they are doing what\u2019s best for them, what is the safest choice for them.\u201d",

She yells at Elphaba for trying to help animals instead of her. As a result, Elphaba opens her Grimmerie and casts a spell on Nessarose, giving her the ability to fly.",

He complies \u2014 but then she uncovers a secret crevice where the Wizard had kept in cages dozens of animals, including Elphaba\u2019s former professor Dr. Dillamond, preventing them from speaking. Outraged, Elphaba frees all the animals, interrupting Glinda as she walks down the aisle.",
      "\u201cWe wanted the stakes to be higher,\u201d Chu says of the change. \u201cWe wanted to make this sort of intercut parallel between her getting married and (Elphaba\u2019s) reality of finding these animals in cages.

Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",

      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",

      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

      "On Nov. 20, the 40-year-old musician uploaded a vlog to YouTube, marking his \u201clong overdue\u201d comeback to the video style that he used during the early days of his career. The 15-minute clip began with footage of him on his Nashville farm and ended with Jelly Roll deciding to shave his beard for the first time in over a decade.",
      "He shared that he wanted to shave his beard as he continues his weight loss journey.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all are exhausted about hearing about my weight loss. But a lot of things change when you start losing weight. You realize things. One of the things I realized is I don\u2019t know what I look like. I\u2019ve had a beard to try to cover up my double chin,\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll added, \u201cThe last time my face was shaved I was fresh out of jail.\u201d",
      "He predicted that he might resemble a Ninja Turtle after shaving his facial hair, but said he wanted to go through with it so he could surprise his family with his new appearance. He shared that he only told his wife, Bunnie XO, about his plans to shave his beard and that his daughter, Bailee Ann, had never seen him without it.",
      "The \u201cGet By\u201d singer used timelapse editing to show him slowly removing his beard as his wife looked on and filmed the moment on her phone. About halfway through the process, he turned to Bunnie XO, who appeared stunned.",

      "He blurred out his face in the shot, saving the reveal for the last minutes of the video. Before he debuted his look to his fans, he showed off his clean-shaven face to his daughter, who instantly responded with laughter.",

      "Taking a more sentimental tone, he continued, \u201cYou know, one of the reasons I\u2019d even started growing a beard was because I was so obese, it was just easier to cover up what was happening here.\u201d",
      "He then went on to talk about \u201cthe craziest thing\u201d that has ever happened to him: his latest Grammy nominations.

      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what artists say. I don\u2019t care what artists act like. I\u2019m going to tell you the real truth. There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",
      "He expressed his gratitude again to the Record Academy and said he wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything without his faith.",
      "Before signing off, he encouraged his fans to mock his beardless face.",
      "\u201cI thought my chin went at least a half inch further than it actually went, f---. I didn\u2019t know. Failed science experiment, y\u2019all!\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll uploaded the snippet of his newly shaven face to Instagram, too. Celebrity friends complimented him about his Grammy nominations beneath the post.",
      "Charlie Puth said, \u201cVery inspiring man.\u201d",
      "Country singer Carly Pearce echoed that sentiment, calling Jelly Roll \u201can inspiration.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fans gave their approval of his look.",

      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",
      "\u201cTo do all the fun stuff in life, you\u2019ve gotta be under 250,\u201d he told host Jimmy Kimmel before mentioning skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, riding a bull and wrestling an alligator. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of things I want to do.\u201d",
      "He gave a progress update in August while giving a speech to the Tennessee Titans. \u201cI lost 200 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI told coach I\u2019m getting a contract if I lose another 50.\u201d"

      "How it went: Over the course of eight weeks, the newlyweds encountered several highs and lows. They experienced trust issues when Josh claimed that he had unfollowed his ex-girlfriend on social media, but later revealed that he hadn't.",
      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event. Josh was concerned that he would lose the sense of community he finds at Burning Man if his wife didn't support his passion.",

      "Josh acknowledged that he envisioned \"a great future\" with his wife and said decision day would \"take a part of me with it\" if Jalyn decided against continuing their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Jalyn opened up about her \"biggest reservations\" as she prepared for decision day, saying she and Josh are \"different people\" who are \"in two different lanes in a lot of ways.\"",
      "\"I feel like this is make or break for me. I think in the past anytime I saw a red flag, I ended the relationship but now I'm married and I don't know what you work through and what you don't. But I hope to feel confident and secure in my decision,\" she said.",
      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",

      "Jalyn also claimed that Josh \"lied\" about many things in their relationship, such as telling her a female coworker was younger than he originally stated.",
      "Meghann and Derrek",

      "How it went: Meghann and Derrek encountered a few issues throughout the experiment. For instance, Derrek thought Meghann was too defensive in their conversations, and she wanted him to be more vulnerable. They also had misaligned expectations on their household roles and duties.",
      "When Meghann discovered that she was pregnant, their relationship shifted for the better, with both of the newlyweds committing to their connection.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Derrek noted that Meghann's pregnancy added \"a whole other element\" to the experiment. Still, he was feeling confident going into the discussion.",
      "On her way to filming, Meghann reflected on the moment, saying, \"We have a lot of things that are gonna hit us, a lot of new things in the future that we're gonna have to figure out. And we need to really work through this.\"",
      "While sitting down with the relationship experts, the couple announced their pregnancy. When the big moment arrived, Derrek went first and shared his decision.",
      "\"You are extremely caring and compassionate and without any hesitation, 100% I want to stay married to you. I love you and I love your sense of humor.

      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",

      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks. Rhonda told her husband she didn't feel like he was interested in hearing about her life since he regularly made the conversation about him. He was taken aback and tried to remedy the situation.",
      "Still, it was a consistent theme throughout the eight-week experiment for the newlyweds.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: While preparing to make his decision Pat admitted that he was feeling \"conflicted.\"",

      "\"It's been hard but also it's been everything I think I could have ever hoped for,\" she said.",
      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",
      "While reflecting on their relationship, Belynda also said Chad's drinking issues were an obstacle for her to overcome.",
      "Brittany and Will",
      "How it started: Brittany and Will had a sweet connection after  they met for the first time at the altar. However, things were understandably a bit awkward at first.",
      "How it went: While getting to know each other, Brittany and Will struggled with communication issues. Brittany wanted her husband to open up and be more expressive with his emotions, but he was slow to show his vulnerable side.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Brittany was \"hopeful\" when she woke up. Then Will called her to say his answer was no. Still, they both showed up to the discussion to talk things out.",
      "Will arrived first and told the relationship experts he intended to leave his marriage.",
      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",
      "Will went on to say that his wife \u201ctries to compare things to how she feels them\u201d and said \u201cif it\u2019s not how she feels, then it doesn't matter and it's not validated.\u201d",
      "When Brittany arrived, she apologized to her husband for not being able to \"express how important\" he was to her. She then called him \"the most kind, genuine, thoughtful person.\"",
      "\"I'm just so sorry if I haven't made you feel that way, if I haven't made you feel like you're important to me and your feelings are important to me, because they are,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm thankful that I was able to make you feel those things in those ways. I didn't know,\" Will replied.",
      "Will said he needed more time and walked away to gather his thoughts. When he returned, Will decided to give their marriage another try.",
      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

      "All four \u2014 two men, aged 38 and 39, and two women, 31 and 40 \u2014 are from the Paris region, Laure Beccuau, a prosecutor for the city, said in a statement.",
      "The arrests Tuesday are in addition to four people already charged in the case. Three men and one woman were charged with organized theft and criminal conspiracy to commit crimes and offenses, according to the statement.",
      "Last month, the group duped security systems and used power tools in broad daylight to steal millions in jewels from the famed Paris museum. They ultimately made off with royal jewels, once worn by France\u2019s queens and empresses, officials told NBC News.",
      "The Ministry of Culture confirmed the jewels stolen included a necklace and a pair of earrings from the Marie-Louise collection; a necklace, earrings and a tiara from from the Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Queen Hortense collection; and a brooch, bodice bow and a tiara from the collection of Empress Eug\u00e9nie.",

    "summary": "As the UN Climate Change Conference was happening in Brazil, the Trump administration released proposals to open up offshore drilling and roll back protections for wetlands and endangered animals.",
    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",
      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",

      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",

      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",

      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine \"will lose in a short period of time\" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.",

      "Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv\u2019s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.",
      "Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.",
      "Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk \"without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,\" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it \"will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,\" he said.",

      "In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 \u201cand likely even longer,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely \u201cto save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,\" it said.",
      "On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn\u2019t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.\u201d",
      "Pokrovsk is \u201con the verge of falling into Russian hands,\u201d said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.",
      "That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the \u201cfortress belt\u201d of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.",
      "Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.",
      "Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.",
      "Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.",
      "Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.",
      "Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.",

      "Jimmy Cliff, the legendary musician who expanded the popularity of reggae around the world, has died, his family announced Monday on his official Instagram account.",
      "He was 81.",
      "\"It\u2019s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\" his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"The Harder They Come,\" the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film's soundtrack was a major international success and helped spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement: \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.\"",
      "Tributes poured in from the musical world, including many from artists whom Cliff inspired.",
      "\"A true foundation, a pillar of our music, and one of the first to carry reggae out into the world,\" Ali Campbell, of the British reggae group UB40, said on X.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit at age 14 with \"Hurricane Hattie\" and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech by Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff by writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \"The Harder They Come,\" he would have merited inclusion.",
      "Cliff was a foundational figure in the Jamaican reggae scene. He worked as an A&R man, discovering new talent for Beverley's Records. The legendary label promoted ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae and played a role in the discoveries of both Desmond Dekker and a young Bob Marley.",
      "A prolific artist well into later life, Cliff collaborated with a string of non-reggae musicians, including the Rolling Stones and Paul Simon. At the same time, the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson have recorded versions of his songs.",
      "Bob Dylan declared Cliff's song \"Vietnam\" the \"greatest protest song ever written,\" according to Cliff's website.",
      "After a creative resurgence in 2012 with the Grammy-winning album \"Rebirth,\" Cliff said, according to his website: \"Now, I feel I have not completed what I\u2019m here on this planet to do. I have to say what I have to say and do what I have to do via music and films. Every morning I wake up, that keeps me going.\""

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"a tremendous amount of progress\" was made Sunday after a day of talks with Ukrainian and European officials in Switzerland, however the U.S. efforts to coordinate a Ukraine peace push were clouded by concerns over the origins of the proposal.",
      "The 28-point plan suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds, stipulates limits on Ukraine\u2019s army, and prevents Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 concessions that amount to a near-mirror of Moscow\u2019s long-standing demands.",
      "Rubio told reporters Sunday the talks in Geneva marked \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue.\"",
      "\"We arrived here today with one goal, and the goal was to take, you know what, 28 points, or 26 points, depending on which version as it continues to evolve, and try to narrow the ones that were open items,\" he said.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an open dialogue with the U.S. and \u201csigns that President Trump\u2019s team is listening to us\u201d are important.",
      "\u201cIt is important to ensure that the steps to end the war are effective and that everything is workable,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine never wanted war, and we will never be an obstacle to peace. Diplomacy has been activated, which is good. We expect that the result will be the right steps.\u201d",
      "Origins of the plan",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in an X post Sunday that European leaders were ready to work on the plan \u201cdespite some reservations,\u201d but added: \u201cBefore we start our work, it would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Saturday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Rubio had told them that the existing text being discussed was not in fact a U.S. initiative, nor the administration\u2019s position, but rather a Russian proposal given to special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "The plan \u201cwas not the administration\u2019s plan\u201d but a \u201cwish list of the Russians,\u201d Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said Rubio told them.",

      "A State Department spokesperson later denied the senators\u2019 account, calling it \u201cblatantly false,\u201d while Rubio has asserted that the U.S. did produce the proposal.",
      "\u201cThe peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations,\u201d Rubio wrote on X late Saturday night. \u201cIt is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "A senior Trump administration official told NBC News previously that the plan was developed in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials.",

      "This confusion is \u201ceither by design for the Russian side, or it\u2019s a reflection of incoherence inside the administration,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House previously described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d but the mixed messages from Washington \u2014 combined with nervous allies demanding clarity \u2014 have deepened doubts about what the U.S. is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Rubio on Sunday said the talks precipitated about three weeks ago with a \u201cfoundational document that we socialized and ran by both sides and with input from both sides.\u201d While he declined to go into specifics, he affirmed, \u201cthe items that remain open are not insurmountable.\u201d",
      "He said the proposal is \u201ca living breathing document\u201d that is changing everyday, and progress is contingent on Russia\u2019s approval.",
      "Thanksgiving deadline",

      "A U.S. official said Rubio, Witkoff and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d coordination meetings Sunday morning in Geneva, followed by more detailed afternoon talks aimed at ironing out the terms of a potential peace agreement.",

      "In a Truth Social post, Trump called for an end to the war and said, in all capital letters: \u201cUkraine 'leadership' has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts, and Europe continues to buy oil from Russia.\"",
      "European response",
      "European leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa on Saturday and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",

      "The Formula 1 cars blasted down the Las Vegas Strip for 50 laps at breathtaking speeds of over 215 mph, delivering thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing under the bright lights for the third consecutive year.",
      "But in a stunning twist, both Norris and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri were later disqualified in the middle of the night, hours after the race finish and podium celebrations, with officials finding illegal plank wear on their cars.",
      "Norris crossed the line in second place, ahead of title rival Piastri, who finished in fourth. Their disqualification carries huge implications for the world championship fight with just two more Grand Prix races and one \u201csprint\u201d left in the season.",
      "It puts Norris just 24 points ahead of both Piastri and four-time world champion Verstappen, who are tied on points in second place. Norris now has 390 points, while Piastri and Verstappen have 366.",
      "\u201cA frustrating end to today,\u201d Norris said in a statement. \u201cWe had to do some managing towards the end of the race and now we know it was due to some issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\u201d",
      "Piastri called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "F1 rules require the wooden skid blocks under the cars to be at least 9 mm thick after a race in order to be deemed legal, a way to control ride height and contact with the ground. The penalty for failing to meet that standard is disqualification. It\u2019s rare, but not unheard of.",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the breach was unintentional and apologized to Norris and Piastri \u201cfor the loss of points today, at a critical time in their Championship campaigns.\u201d He also apologized to McLaren partners and fans.",
      "\u201cWhile this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season,\u201d Stella said.",
      "There are just two Grand Prix left in a 2025 season full of twists and turns \u2014 next weekend in Qatar and the weekend after in Abu Dhabi. The Qatar race features a shortened \u201csprint\u201d race, too, so there are a maximum of 58 points still up for grabs.",
      "\u201cThe upcoming weekends, we\u2019ll again try to win the race, and at the end of Abu Dhabi we\u2019ll see where we end up,\u201d Verstappen said of the title fight in a postrace interview ahead of the McLarens\u2019 disqualification.",
      "Norris started first but lost two positions in the opening corners after making an aggressive move to defend his lead, but ran wide on the first turn and got overtaken by Verstappen and George Russell. He eventually overtook Russell of Mercedes but couldn\u2019t get close to Verstappen, and he was forced to slow his pace toward the end due to a then-unknown issue with the car.",
      "Russell was promoted from third to second. Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli finished fifth but was moved up to third.",
      "\u201cI messed it up and made my life tougher into turn one,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut even after that, we just weren\u2019t quick enough. ... I was pushing flat out and Max was still pulling away.\u201d",
      "Piastri fell a further six points behind Norris before the disqualification, but now they remain 24 points apart.",
      "An economic boost for Las Vegas",
      "Local leaders hope the race weekend will provide a much-needed economic boost to Las Vegas, which has struggled this year due to high costs and declining tourism, among other issues. Last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix delivered an economic impact of $934 million, according to one estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important event. And I fully support all of our special events. We\u2019re not just the entertainment capital, we\u2019re the entertainment and sports capital,\u201d U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who represents parts of the city, told NBC News ahead of the race. \u201cSo having a marquee event like this on the Las Vegas Strip is great, and it does a lot for our economy.\u201d",
      "F1 is looking to build on its momentum with American fans, having secured the races in Miami and Las Vegas \u2014 in addition to the long-standing Grand Prix in Austin \u2014 on the calendar for the long haul. It signed a five-year deal with Apple, which will take over the U.S. broadcast rights from ESPN starting next year.",
      "Celebrity sightings included musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, actors Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas and Naomi Campbell, NBA All-Stars Magic Johnson and Jimmy Butler, and tennis player Taylor Fritz. Actor Catherine Zeta-Jones waved the checkered flag.",
      "The top three finishers were driven to the podium, which is located on the Strip at the Bellagio Fountain Club, in a pink LEGO-built Cadillac car driven by Terry Crews.",
      "Before the race, Ferrari superstar Lewis Hamilton took Beyonc\u00e9 on a hot lap around the circuit, a team spokesperson confirmed, as she was decked out in a Louis Vuitton custom racing suit. The two stars were spotted watching the race from the Ferrari garage.",

And we\u2019re excited to see everybody race,\u201d Noem said, adding that she was getting a tour of the McLaren garage. Patel called Formula 1 \u201cone of the greatest sports,\u201d saying he\u2019s a McLaren fan.",
      "Rain brings chaos in qualifying",
      "The Friday qualifying session was thrown into chaos due to rain, which extracted every ounce of skill from the 20 drivers just to stay out of the barriers. The track, already known to have low grip even in dry conditions, was slippery and treacherous for most of the session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out,\u201d Norris said after taking pole position. \u201cOne day, I just hope \u2014 apart from having a two-seater F1 car \u2014 people can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable.\u201d",
      "And the Las Vegas paddock was abuzz with internal drama among several teams during the weekend.",
      "Piastri was asked about recently reposting an Instagram post that quoted F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone claiming McLaren \u201cprefers\u201d Norris because of his \u201chigh star quality\u201d and \u201cmarketing appeal.\u201d",
      "Asked about the repost, which was highlighted online by F1 content creators, Piastri told reporters it was an error.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Friday after deleting it from his feed. \u201cI woke up this morning and saw it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I accidentally did it. Obviously, it was not intentional. But yeah, I didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u201d",
      "Instagram has one-click reposts \u2014 unlike X, which requires users to click twice to confirm \u2014 making it easy to erroneously repost something while scrolling. Still, it added to a drama in which the Australian driver\u2019s fans have theorized that the British team favors his British teammate, a claim that McLaren firmly denies.",
      "Ferrari\u2019s two drivers downplayed recent comments by Ferrari chairperson John Elkann, who said they should \u201ctalk less and focus on driving\u201d \u2014 remarks slammed by critics as a gratuitous dig against Charles Leclerc and Hamilton after Ferrari\u2019s decision to build a new car for 2025 (rather than upgrade last year\u2019s version) backfired and led to a winless season so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always willing to do less media,\u201d Hamilton quipped.",
      "The seven-time world champion told reporters it\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d possible to focus any more on driving than he already does. \u201cI wake up thinking about it. And I go to sleep thinking about it. And I think about it while I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Hamilton said.",
      "Leclerc said the comment was a product of Elkann\u2019s ambition to maximize the team\u2019s potential. \u201cHe loves Ferrari. I love Ferrari. We all love Ferrari,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cWhen he called me, he told me what were the intentions of these words, and that was very clear. It was a positive message, trying to be positive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari currently sits fourth in a close battle for second in the team championship, behind Mercedes and Red Bull. While the driver\u2019s title carries more glory, the constructors\u2019 championship is the one that awards cash prizes. Ferrari finished runner-up to McLaren last year in a close battle.",
      "While Hamilton said he takes no positives regarding his comeback from last place to a points finish, he enjoys racing in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI love coming to Vegas,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really great city. Always get a great welcome here. This is the biggest crowd I think we\u2019ve seen, even though it\u2019s quite cold.\u201d",
      "And the activities of the weekend have evolved over the three years as F1 seeks a better balance between sport and show.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMay as well be in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then.\u201d"

      "Straus had been offered a seat on a lifeboat due to his age, but he insisted that other men go first. Ida Straus refused to leave his side. They were among the very few first-class passengers to perish in the disaster that claimed 1,500 lives.",
      "The watch remained in the Straus family for more than a century before being sold at Henry Aldridge & Son Auctioneers in the British town of Devizes.",
      "Other Titanic treasures auctioned off on Saturday include a letter written by Ida Straus aboard the Titanic, a passenger list and a gold medal awarded to the RMS Carpathia\u2019s crew by survivors, with the auction bringing in a total of \u00a33 million ($3.92 million) on Saturday.",
      "\u201cEvery man, woman and child had a story,\u201d auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told NBC News on Sunday. \"And we\u2019re retelling those stories 113 years later.\"",
      "The Strauses, in particular, \"have been dramatized in every Titanic movie that\u2019s been made,\" he added, calling theirs an \"incredible love story.\"",
      "\"Obviously you\u2019re looking at what the object is,\" he said. \"But one of the most crucial elements to their value is who they belong to.\"",
      "The previous record was set last year when another gold pocket watch, presented to the captain of a boat that rescued more than 700 passengers from the liner, sold for \u00a31.56 million.",
      "Isidor Straus, born in 1845 into a Jewish family in Otterberg, Bavaria, emigrated to the United States in 1854. The couple was traveling home from a trip when they boarded the doomed Titanic in Southampton, heading for New York."

    "story": [
      "Teachers who were well prepared and well equipped may have ended a grizzly bear attack on their group of Canadian schoolchildren in British Columbia this week before it became deadly, authorities said.",
      "Two people were critically injured, two were seriously injured, and seven others were treated at the scene Thursday afternoon in the small community of Bella Coola, BC Emergency Health Services said in a statement.",
      "On Saturday, the BC Conservation Officer Service said the search for the bear expanded to include two additional grizzlies witnesses said were nearby during the incident.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Tamara Davidson, minister of environment and parks in the Canadian province, said that three children and one adult were seriously injured and remained hospitalized. Their relatives did not want to release the patients' latest conditions, she said.",
      "\"I want to recognize the teachers who took great risk to protect their students,\" Davidson said. \"Their actions deserve our greatest respect and gratitude. They were well prepared, and they are the true heroes.\"",
      "Inspector Kevin Van Damme of the Conservation Officer Service said the teachers used bear spray and small noisemakers called bear bangers to repel the animal.",
      "\u201cDuring a school outing, the group had stopped along a trail near the community where a single grizzly bear emerged from the forest and attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cTeachers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect the children. They definitely avoided worse injuries.\u201d",
      "Authorities were collecting evidence from the attack site to help identify and capture the bear, Van Damme said. In the meantime, residents and visitors in the area, known for outdoor activities, were told to stay indoors.",
      "\"I really need to stress how dangerous this situation is with this bear at large,\" Van Damme said, adding later during the news conference: \"I have not seen an attack like this \u2014 with a large group of people.\"",
      "He added that an incident involving more than a dozen people is \"extremely rare.\"",
      "The Nuxalk Nation of Indigenous people in the region asked everyone in the area to \"avoid all trails.\"",
      "Residents of the 4 Mile area in Bella Coola were told to remain indoors on Saturday, and potential visitors were advised to stay away. Additional conservation officers joined the search alongside a Royal Canadian Mounted Police helicopter crew with heat imaging technology, the Conservation Officer Service said in a statement on Saturday.",
      "The board and administration of Acwsalcta School, an independent institution run by the Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a statement that school would remain closed Monday and that counseling would be available.",
      "Parent Veronica Schooner told The Associated Press that, among the many who tried to halt the attack, one teacher \u201cgot the whole brunt of it\u201d and was transported to a hospital.",
      "Schooner said her 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class of fourth and fifth graders attacked by the bear and was close enough that \u201che even felt its fur.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\u201d Schooner said.",
      "She added that some children were hit with the bear spray.",
      "The British Columbia Assembly of First Nations, an umbrella organization for the 204 First Nations of Indigenous people in the province, said the attack should inspire reconsideration of measures to prevent such incidents.",
      "\"This event raises important questions about safety protocols, community preparedness and the respect for First Nations\u2019 knowledge in managing wildlife,\" the organization said in a statement that also expressed solidarity with the Nuxalk Nation.",
      "The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit that works toward environmental preservation, said Friday that a 2017 province ban on hunting grizzlies correlates to a rise in such attacks because the bears, plentiful in Bella Coola, have been freer to learn behavior dangerous to humans.",
      "Since the prohibition started, the federation said in a statement  Friday, the number of bear reports to the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has doubled.",
      "\u201cWith no hunting pressure, grizzlies and humans will increasingly occupy the same spaces with inevitable consequences,\u201d BC Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Zeman said.",
      "While the federation expressed hope the incident would lead to reconsideration of the hunting ban, Davidson, the province's parks minister, said it was too soon.",
      "\"This is an ongoing live situation where the bear is still at large and the community doesn't feel safe,\" she said. \"No considerations just yet.\"",
      "At the same time, Davidson said, her ministry hopes the families of those attacked experience \"healing and comfort in the coming days.\""

    "summary": "Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Saturday killed at least 24 people and wounded dozens more.",
    "story": [
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel's military on Saturday launched airstrikes against Hamas militants in Gaza in the latest test of the ceasefire that began on Oct. 10. Health officials in Gaza reported at least 24 people killed and another 54 wounded, including children.",
      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "\"Suddenly, I heard a powerful explosion. I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn't see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,\" said Khalil Abu Hatab in Deir al-Balah. \"When I looked again, I realized the upper floor of my neighbor's house was gone.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There's no safe place.\"",
      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "A U.S.-led peace plan that mirrors several key Russian demands has sent ripples across Europe, with leaders voicing concerns that it could leave Ukraine vulnerable and calling for changes to the proposals.",
      "European leaders and key allies met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",
      "The statement was signed by leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, as well as the European Union Commission and the E.U. Council. Japan\u2019s and Canada\u2019s leaders also signed on to the statement, which warns that \u201cborders must not be changed by force.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has set Thanksgiving as the deadline for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point framework, which suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds and would place limits on Ukraine\u2019s army and prevent Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 Moscow\u2019s long-sought demands.",
      "The U.S. proposals do include a security guarantee modeled on NATO\u2019s Article 5, which would commit the U.S. and European allies to treat a future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire trans-Atlantic community, according to a U.S. official, though there are few specifics on what that would entail.",
      "Top Ukrainian and U.S. officials will meet in Switzerland to discuss \u201cpossible parameters of a future peace,\u201d Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Telegram Saturday. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said Saturday that the delegation has been confirmed for the talks, which \u201cwill take place in the coming days.\u201d",
      "The White House has described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d saying the proposals were crafted with input from Russia and Ukraine.",
      "However, analysts say the plan could amount to a dangerous capitulation for Ukraine, which has previously rejected plans that would require recognizing Russia\u2019s illegal annexations of the entire eastern Donetsk region and Crimea.",
      "\u201cEven if parts of this plan were to be shoved down Ukraine\u2019s throat, it would be the end of Ukraine as we know it. It\u2019s a real capitulation,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, who was in Johannesburg, told NBC News by phone.",
      "The U.S. was facilitating a \u201cpotentially disastrous surrender for Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has broken new ground in a country that struggles with gender equality. But she has quickly run up against a tradition that may be immovable.",
      "Trophies for sumo wrestling, Japan\u2019s national sport, are sometimes presented by the country\u2019s top leader \u2014 most recently in January, when Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister at the time, awarded the winner\u2019s trophy at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But awkward questions arose ahead of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, which concludes Sunday in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Takaichi is prohibited from entering the ring according to the rules of sumo, which consider women impure.",
      "Takaichi will have a chance to sidestep the issue as the Japanese leader is expected to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend amid a diplomatic spat with China.",
      "But the dilemma could resurface during the New Year\u2019s tournament in Tokyo.",
      "In Japan, sumo is not just a sport but a 1,500-year-old tradition that is held sacred in the nation of over 100 million people. It has deep roots in Shinto, Japan\u2019s Indigenous religion.",
      "Experts suggested Takaichi, a hard-line conservative elected last month whose policies are not seen as particularly pro-women, is likely to avoid the issue altogether so as not to challenge tradition, and send another high-ranking government official instead.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to upset her supporters or conservatives,\u201d said Hiromi Murakami, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to even see a discussion around the topic,\u201d she said.",
      "Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, said last week that Takaichi \u201cholds the view that Japan\u2019s sumo culture is a traditional art form that should be cherished.\u201d",
      "She \u201cintends to respect the traditions of sumo culture,\u201d he later told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Reached for comment this week, the Japan Sumo Association said it had not received any request from Takaichi\u2019s office regarding her involvement. The association told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this month, \u201cWe believe it is our mission to pass down the traditional culture of sumo.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time there have been questions as to whether a high-ranking female official would be allowed to enter the sumo ring, also known as the dohyo.",
      "In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama became Japan\u2019s first female chief Cabinet secretary, who often represents the government at sumo trophy ceremonies. The sumo association did not allow her to do so.",
      "The association rejected another request in 2000 by Japan\u2019s first female governor, Fusae Ohta, to enter the sumo ring at a tournament in the city of Osaka. She ultimately presented the trophy on a walkway next to the dohyo.",
      "In 2018, a female mayor, Tomoko Nakagawa of the city of Takarazuka, was denied a request to make a speech in the ring. That same year, the association apologized after two women were ordered out of the ring when they rushed to the aid of a mayor who had collapsed inside it.",
      "Such incidents underscore the challenges that continue to face women in Japan, which ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.",
      "Sumo wrestling has also proved popular on the rare occasion a competition is held outside Japan. Last month, tickets sold out for the Grand Sumo Tournament at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, which hosted the event for the first time in 34 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting that they went to the U.K.,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a female political leader who wants to give the trophy, what would happen then?\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."
